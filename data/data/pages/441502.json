{"id":441502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_function","text":"In mathematics, a bijective function or bijection is a function \"f\"\u00A0:\u00A0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" that is both an injection and a surjection. This is equivalent to the following statement: for every element \"b\" in the codomain \"B\", there is \"exactly\" one element \"a\" in the domain \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\". Another name for bijection is 1-1 correspondence (read \"one-to-one correspondence).\nThe term \"bijection\" and the related terms \"surjection\" and \"injection\" were introduced by Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics.\nBasic properties.\nwhere the element formula_1 is called the image of the element formula_1, and the element formula_1 the pre-image of the element formula_1.\nNote: Surjection means minimum one pre-image. Injection means maximum one pre-image. So bijection means exactly one pre-image.\nCardinality.\nCardinality is the \"number\" of elements in a set. The cardinality of \"A\"= is 4. This can be written as #\"A\"=4.\nBy definition, two sets \"A\" and \"B\" have the same cardinality if there is a bijection between the sets. So #\"A\"=#\"B\" means there is a bijection from A to B.\nBijections and inverse functions.\nBijections and inverse functions are related to each other, in that a bijection is invertible, can be turned into its inverse function by reversing the arrows.\nLet \"f\"\u00A0:\u00A0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" be a bijection. The inverse function \"g\"\u00A0:\u00A0\"B\" \u2192 \"A\" is defined by if \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\", then \"g\"(\"b\")=\"a\". (See also Inverse function.)\nNote: The notation for the inverse function of \"f\" is confusing. Namely,\nElementary functions.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\"):\u211D\u2192\u211D be a real-valued function \"y\"=\"f\"(\"x\") of a real-valued argument \"x\". (This means both the input and output are numbers.)\nProving that a function is a bijection means proving that it is both a surjection and an injection. So formal proofs are rarely easy. Below we \"discuss\" and do not prove. (See surjection and injection.)\nExample: The linear function of a slanted line is a bijection. That is, \"y\"=\"ax\"+\"b\" where \"a\"\u22600 is a bijection.\nExample: The polynomial function of third degree: \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"3 is a bijection. Image 2 and image 5 thin yellow curve. Its inverse is the cube root function \"f\"(\"x\")= \u221B\"x\" and it is also a bijection \"f\"(\"x\"):\u211D\u2192\u211D. Image 5: thick green curve.\nExample: The quadratic function \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\"2 is not a bijection (from \u211D\u2192\u211D). Image 3. It is not a surjection. It is not an injection. However, we can restrict both its domain and codomain to the set of non-negative numbers (0,+\u221E) to get an (invertible) bijection (see examples below).\nExample: Suppose our function \"machine\" is \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"\u00B2.\nBijections and their inverses.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\"):\"A\"\u2192\"B\" where \"A\" and \"B\" are subsets of \u211D.\nExample: The quadratic function defined on the restricted domain and codomain [0,+\u221E)\nis a bijection. Image 6: thin yellow curve.\nExample: The square root function defined on the restricted domain and codomain [0,+\u221E)\nis the bijection defined as the inverse function of the quadratic function: \"x'2\". Image 6: thick green curve.\nExample: The exponential function defined on the domain \u211D and the restricted codomain (0,+\u221E)\nis a bijection. Image 4: thin yellow curve (\"a\"=10).\nExample: The logarithmic function base \"a\" defined on the restricted domain (0,+\u221E) and the codomain \u211D\nis the bijection defined as the inverse function of the exponential function: \"a'x\".
