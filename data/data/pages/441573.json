{"id":441573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostratic","text":"Nostratic is a hypothetical language family which includes many of the present-day language families of Eurasia. The idea is that Nostratic was spoken after the ice sheets melted but before people spread out throughout Europe and Asia.\nMany of today's languages are descendants of Nostratic, so it is thought. These include the Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic and Kartvelian languages. The Afroasiatic languages, native to North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Near East, as well as the Dravidian languages of the Indian subcontinent, are usually included as well.\nThe name \"Nostratic\" is derived from the Latin \"nostrates\", meaning \"us\" (in other words, fellow countrymen). The idea was expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, called the \"Moscovite school\" by Bomhard. It has received renewed attention in English-speaking academia since the 1990s.\nThe hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide. Some linguists are unsure.\nThe hypothetical ancestral language of the Nostratic family is called Proto-Nostratic. It would have been spoken between 15,000 and 12,000 BC, in the Epipalaeolithic period, near the end of the last glacial period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothetical","offset":15},{"uri":"Language_family","surface_form":"language family","offset":28},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":104},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice sheets","offset":161},{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European","offset":328},{"uri":"Uralic_languages","surface_form":"Uralic","offset":343},{"uri":"Altaic_languages","surface_form":"Altaic","offset":351},{"uri":"Kartvelian_languages","surface_form":"Kartvelian","offset":362},{"uri":"Afroasiatic_languages","surface_form":"Afroasiatic languages","offset":388},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":421},{"uri":"Horn_of_Africa","surface_form":"Horn of Africa","offset":439},{"uri":"Arabian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Arabian Peninsula","offset":459},{"uri":"Near_East","surface_form":"Near East","offset":486},{"uri":"Dravidian_languages","surface_form":"Dravidian languages","offset":512},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":539},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":738},{"uri":"Epipalaeolithic","surface_form":"Epipalaeolithic","offset":1154}]}
