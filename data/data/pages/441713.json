{"id":441713,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram","text":"Instagram (sometimes shortened to Insta or IG) is an online photo and video sharing social networking service. It allows users to take pictures and videos, apply digital filters to them and share them to their followers. They can then share them on a variety of social networking services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Flickr.\nUntil 2015, Instagram confined photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images. This was different than the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by digital cameras. Users were able to share very short videos. In 2017 the length limit was raised to ten minutes.\nInstagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. It was released on October 6, 2010.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Photo","surface_form":"photo and","offset":60},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":70},{"uri":"Social_networking_service","surface_form":"social networking","offset":84},{"uri":"Photographic_filter","surface_form":"filters","offset":170},{"uri":"Social_network_service","surface_form":"social networking services","offset":262},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":298},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":308},{"uri":"Tumblr","surface_form":"Tumblr","offset":317},{"uri":"Flickr","surface_form":"Flickr","offset":328},{"uri":"Square","surface_form":"square","offset":379},{"uri":"Instamatic","surface_form":"Instamatic","offset":410},{"uri":"Instant_camera","surface_form":"Polaroid","offset":425},{"uri":"Aspect_ratio","surface_form":"aspect ratio","offset":474},{"uri":"Digital_camera","surface_form":"digital camera","offset":505},{"uri":"Kevin_Systrom","surface_form":"Kevin Systrom","offset":643},{"uri":"Mike_Krieger","surface_form":"Mike Krieger","offset":661}]}
