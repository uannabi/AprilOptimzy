It lies south of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim. Around the year 500 the town gets the name \"Spira\", named after the stream \"Speyerbach\" which flows into the Rhine river here.\nThe center of Speyer is dominated by the cathedral. Here are the tombs of several of the Salian emperors: the bodies, however, are believed to have gone missing during one of the French invasions during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Former Country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":40},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"state","offset":52},{"uri":"Rhineland-Palatinate","surface_form":"Rhineland-Palatinate","offset":61},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":119},{"uri":"Ludwigshafen","surface_form":"Ludwigshafen","offset":149},{"uri":"Mannheim","surface_form":"Mannheim","offset":166},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":285},{"uri":"Tomb","surface_form":"tomb","offset":368},{"uri":"Salian_Dynasty","surface_form":"Salian emperors","offset":392}]}
