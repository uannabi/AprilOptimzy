It was fought in New Mexico Territory on 28 March 1862. It was one of the farthest west battles of the war. There was a skirmish (or minor battle between small groups) on March 26. This was between scouting parties from each army. The main battle took place on March 28. The Confederates were able to push the Union force back through the pass. However, the Confederates had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses were run off. Eventually, the Confederates had to leave the territory and return to Texas.\nOther websites.\n[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/91glorieta/91glorieta.htm The Battle of Glorieta Pass: A Shattered Dream, \"National Park Service\"]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":34},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":52},{"uri":"New_Mexico_Territory","surface_form":"New Mexico Territory","offset":89},{"uri":"1862","surface_form":"1862","offset":122},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":155},{"uri":"Reconnaissance","surface_form":"scouting parties","offset":270},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":297},{"uri":"Confederate_States_Army","surface_form":"Confederates","offset":347},{"uri":"Union_Army","surface_form":"Union","offset":382},{"uri":"Retreat","surface_form":"retreat","offset":450},{"uri":"Logistics","surface_form":"supply train","offset":469},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":514},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":605}]}
