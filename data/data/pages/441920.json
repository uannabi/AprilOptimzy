The aircraft had 227 passengers and twelve crew members on board.\nFlight 370 left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at 00:41 on 8 March 2014 (MST; UTC+8) for a scheduled six-hour flight to Beijing, China. Subang Air Traffic Control Centre lost contact with the plane at about 01:22, while over the Gulf of Thailand. It was reported missing at 02:40.\nThe United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating to see if terrorism is involved. Two passengers, one from Austria and another one from Italy, were named on the manifest. However, they were later discovered not to have been on board, their passports having been stolen. Meanwhile, Malaysian authorities are also ruling the identity of two other passengers to be false.\nOn 24 March 2014, officials with both Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government stated that while the aircraft's whereabouts were still not known, \"unparalleled\" analyses by the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and UK satellite company Inmarsat indicated that it had crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. It was presumed by these officials that all 239 people aboard died.\nOn 29 July 2015, a flaperon was found on a beach in Saint-Andr\u00E9, on R\u00E9union island. On 5 August, the Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak announced that the found flaperon was confirmed to be from flight MH370's aircraft.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["aircraft occurrence"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Codeshare_agreement","surface_form":"codeshare agreement","offset":56},{"uri":"Malaysia_Airlines","surface_form":"Malaysia Airlines","offset":130},{"uri":"Kuala_Lumpur","surface_form":"Kuala Lumpur","offset":262},{"uri":"Time_in_Malaysia","surface_form":"MST","offset":312},{"uri":"UTC%2B8","surface_form":"UTC+8","offset":317},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":359},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Thailand","surface_form":"Gulf of Thailand","offset":468},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":524},{"uri":"Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","surface_form":"Federal Bureau of Investigation","offset":538},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":603},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":651},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":680},{"uri":"Air_Accidents_Investigation_Branch","surface_form":"Air Accidents Investigation Branch","offset":1113},{"uri":"Inmarsat","surface_form":"Inmarsat","offset":1180},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":1237},{"uri":"Flaperon","surface_form":"flaperon","offset":1338},{"uri":"Saint-Andr%C3%A9%2C_R%C3%A9union","surface_form":"Saint-Andr\u00E9","offset":1371},{"uri":"R%C3%A9union","surface_form":"R\u00E9union","offset":1387},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Malaysia","offset":1420},{"uri":"Najib_Razak","surface_form":"Najib Razak","offset":1447}]}
