{"id":441993,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utatsusaurus","text":"\"Utatsusaurus\" is the earliest-known form of an ichthyopterygian. It lived in the earliest Lower Triassic period, about 250245 millions years ago. It is nearly 3m (about 9 feet) long with a slender body.\nThe name \"Utatsusaurus\" was given after the city Utatsu-cho where the first specimen was found. The fossils have been found in the Lower Triassic of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan and British Columbia, Canada.\n\"Utatsusaurus\" is one of the most primitive (basal) types of ichthyosaur. It has transitional features between its ancestral land-dwelling forms and the more derived ichthyosaurs. Unlike the more advanced ichthyosaurs, \"Utatsusaurus\" has no dorsal fin and has a broad skull. The snout gently tapers, compared to the more rounded one of more derived ichthyopterygians. The tail had a long low fin, quite different from the tail shape of later forms. This suggests that the animal swam by undulation, waving its body to & fro, rather than using its paddles and tail.\nThe 2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami destroyed the local museum, but fortunately the specimens were not there at the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ichthyopterygia","surface_form":"ichthyopterygia","offset":48},{"uri":"Lower_Triassic","surface_form":"Lower Triassic","offset":91},{"uri":"Utatsu%2C_Miyagi","surface_form":"Utatsu-cho","offset":253},{"uri":"Lower_Triassic","surface_form":"Lower Triassic","offset":335},{"uri":"Miyagi_Prefecture","surface_form":"Miyagi Prefecture","offset":353},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":372},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":382},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":400},{"uri":"Primitive","surface_form":"primitive","offset":442},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":453},{"uri":"Ichthyosaur","surface_form":"ichthyosaur","offset":469},{"uri":"Transitional_fossil","surface_form":"transitional","offset":489},{"uri":"Derived","surface_form":"derived","offset":566},{"uri":"Dorsal_fin","surface_form":"dorsal fin","offset":649},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":676},{"uri":"Derived","surface_form":"derived","offset":749},{"uri":"Ichthyopterygia","surface_form":"ichthyopterygians","offset":757},{"uri":"Undulation","surface_form":"undulation","offset":895},{"uri":"2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami","surface_form":"2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami","offset":977}]}
