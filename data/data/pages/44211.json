{"id":44211,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratorio","text":"e=\"preserve\">An oratorio is a piece of music for orchestra, choir and solo singers. It usually tells a story from the Old Testament. An oratorio may be about two hours long: a whole concert. It is rather like an opera, but whereas an opera is acted out in costume on a stage, an oratorio is sung and played in a concert hall or church. The oratorio as we know it was created in the 18th century. The words were normally in the composer\u2019s own language, not in Italian like most operas were at that time.\nThe word \"oratorio\" had been used many centuries ago for music-dramas performed in churches in western Europe. In Italy oratorios and operas were both being composed in the 17th century. In Germany composers like Heinrich Schutz and, later, Johann Sebastian Bach were writing Passions which tell the story of the crucifixion. These are not usually called \u201Coratorios\u201D but they are similar.\nThe first important composer of oratorios was George Frideric Handel. Handel, who was born in Germany, had become English. Handel had written a lot of operas, but in 1732 he started to write oratorios instead and quite suddenly people became very interested in oratorios. He used the same sort of music as in his operas: the work would start with an overture (an introduction on the orchestra) and then there would be recitative (the bits that told the story), arias (songs for the solo singers) and choruses for the choir. The chorus was very important in oratorios: they got more to sing than in most operas. This meant that choral societies became very popular, and this tradition spread from England (where Handel lived) to other countries in Europe. Handel\u2019s most famous oratorio is \"Messiah\". Unlike most of his other oratorios, the story is not from the Old Testament. It tells the story of the birth, life and death of Jesus. In Britain Handel\u2019s \"Messiah\" is traditionally performed around Christmas. Other oratorios by Handel include: \"Deborah\", \"Saul\", \"Samson\", \"Judas Maccabaeus\" and \"Solomon\". Handel composed all these oratorios to English texts.\nIn the 19th century the oratorio was very popular. At the turn of the century Joseph Haydn wrote some of his best music in his two oratorios: \"Die Sch\u00F6pfung\" (\"The Creation\") (1798) and \"Die Jahreszeiten\" (\"The Seasons\") (1801). Mendelssohn wrote \"St Paul\", \"Elijah\" and the \"Hymn of Praise\". Dvo\u0159\u00E1k, Berlioz and Gounod are among the most important Romantic composers of oratorio, and in the 20th century famous oratorios include Elgar\u2019s \"Dream of Gerontius\" (1900), Walton\u2019s \"Belshazzar\u2019s Feast\" (1931) and Tippett\u2019s \"Child of our Time\" (1941).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":49},{"uri":"Choir","surface_form":"choir","offset":60},{"uri":"Solo_(music)","surface_form":"solo","offset":70},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singers","offset":75},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":118},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":182},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":212},{"uri":"Costume","surface_form":"costume","offset":256},{"uri":"Stage_(theatre)","surface_form":"stage","offset":269},{"uri":"Concert_hall","surface_form":"concert hall","offset":312},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":328},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":382},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":442},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":459},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":606},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":617},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":676},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":693},{"uri":"Heinrich_Schutz","surface_form":"Heinrich Schutz","offset":716},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":744},{"uri":"Passions","surface_form":"Passions","offset":779},{"uri":"Crucifixion","surface_form":"crucifixion","offset":816},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":912},{"uri":"George_Frideric_Handel","surface_form":"George Frideric Handel","offset":938},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":1006},{"uri":"1732","surface_form":"1732","offset":1058},{"uri":"Overture","surface_form":"overture","offset":1242},{"uri":"Recitative","surface_form":"recitative","offset":1310},{"uri":"Aria","surface_form":"arias","offset":1353},{"uri":"Choir","surface_form":"choir","offset":1409},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1588},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1639},{"uri":"Messiah_(Handel)","surface_form":"Messiah","offset":1681},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":1819},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":1829},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":1890},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":2060},{"uri":"Joseph_Haydn","surface_form":"Joseph Haydn","offset":2131},{"uri":"1798","surface_form":"1798","offset":2229},{"uri":"1801","surface_form":"1801","offset":2275},{"uri":"Mendelssohn","surface_form":"Mendelssohn","offset":2282},{"uri":"Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k","surface_form":"Dvo\u0159\u00E1k","offset":2346},{"uri":"Hector_Berlioz","surface_form":"Berlioz","offset":2354},{"uri":"Charles_Gounod","surface_form":"Gounod","offset":2366},{"uri":"Romantic","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":2402},{"uri":"Edward_Elgar","surface_form":"Elgar\u2019s","offset":2483},{"uri":"1900","surface_form":"1900","offset":2513},{"uri":"William_Walton","surface_form":"Walton\u2019s","offset":2520},{"uri":"1931","surface_form":"1931","offset":2551},{"uri":"Michael_Tippett","surface_form":"Tippett\u2019s","offset":2561},{"uri":"1941","surface_form":"1941","offset":2592}]}
