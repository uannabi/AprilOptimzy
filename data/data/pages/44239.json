His father was Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h who founded the religion known as the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith.\n`Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 spent most of his adult life in prison or under arrest, because of his father's new religion. Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h called him the \"Expounder\" of his word, meaning that only `Abdu'l-Bah\u00E1 had the right to say what Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h's writings mean. This was to prevent different people from splitting the religion up because they thought Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h meant different things, the way many other religions have split up.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Persian_people","surface_form":"Persian","offset":19},{"uri":"May_23","surface_form":"May 23","offset":47},{"uri":"1844","surface_form":"1844","offset":55},{"uri":"November_28","surface_form":"November 28","offset":72},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":85},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h","offset":106},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'\u00ED Faith","offset":156}]}
