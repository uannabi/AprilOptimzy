{"id":442644,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Mickey","text":"Robert Larry Mickey (October 21, 1943 \u2013 July 23, 1982) was a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger. Mickey played a total of 11 years in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Chicago Black Hawks, New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, Philadelphia Flyers, and Buffalo Sabres.\nWhen he was playing in the Central Hockey League with the Omaha Knights, he was named to the first team of the All-Stars during the 1966-67 season. His team also made it to the Adams Cup finals the same year.\nOn April 16, 1967, the night before the third game of the Adams Cup play-off series versus the Oklahoma City Blazers, Mickey got into a car accident on a country road near Seward, Nebraska. The crash was caused by the visibility of the road being almost zero because of dust that was blowing from a nearby field. Mickey suffered a broken left arm, cuts, and bruises. His wife Eleanor, who was a passenger in Mickey's car, died in the accident.\nOn July 23, 1982, Mickey committed suicide in Buffalo, New York by sitting in his car while the engine was running in his garage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":61},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":83},{"uri":"Winger_(ice_hockey)","surface_form":"right winger","offset":94},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":149},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Black Hawks","offset":198},{"uri":"New_York_Rangers","surface_form":"New York Rangers","offset":219},{"uri":"Toronto_Maple_Leafs","surface_form":"Toronto Maple Leafs","offset":237},{"uri":"Montreal_Canadiens","surface_form":"Montreal Canadiens","offset":258},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Kings","surface_form":"Los Angeles Kings","offset":278},{"uri":"Philadelphia_Flyers","surface_form":"Philadelphia Flyers","offset":297},{"uri":"Buffalo_Sabres","surface_form":"Buffalo Sabres","offset":322},{"uri":"Central_Professional_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Central Hockey League","offset":365},{"uri":"Omaha_Knights","surface_form":"Omaha Knights","offset":396},{"uri":"Seward%2C_Nebraska","surface_form":"Seward, Nebraska","offset":719},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":1026},{"uri":"Buffalo%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Buffalo, New York","offset":1037}]}
