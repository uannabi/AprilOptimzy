{"id":442704,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovenator","text":"\"Neovenator\" is a dinosaur related to the clade which contains \"Allosaurus\" as its key member. Since the discovery of \"Neovenator\" on the Isle of Wight, UK, it has become one of the best-known large carnivorous dinosaurs in Europe.\n\"Neovenator\" was about 7.5\u00A0meters (24.5 feet) in length, and was of a slim build, weighting 10002000 kg. Some fossils suggest a length of about 10 meters (33 feet), but these fossils are very fragmentary. It lived during the early Cretaceous), about 125 million years ago.\nFossil remains of \"Neovenator\" have been found on the Isle of Wight (southern England), and were first discovered in the 20th century. \"Neovenator\" existed alongside \"Baryonyx\", \"Polacanthus\" and \"Iguanadon\" in the early Cretaceous. It was one of the top predators of its day.\nThe holotype of \"Neovenator salerii\" had many pathologies. They were \"midcaudal vertebrae fusions, healed fractures of mid-caudal vertebra transverse processes; osteophytes affecting pedal phalanges, healed gastralia rib fractures, some forming false joints... [and] scapula fracture\". This means the individual survived and healed after a number of bone fractures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":18},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":42},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":64},{"uri":"Isle_of_Wight","surface_form":"Isle of Wight","offset":138},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":153},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":211},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":224},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":463},{"uri":"Isle_of_Wight","surface_form":"Isle of Wight","offset":559},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":583},{"uri":"Baryonyx","surface_form":"Baryonyx","offset":672},{"uri":"Polacanthus","surface_form":"Polacanthus","offset":684},{"uri":"Iguanadon","surface_form":"Iguanadon","offset":702},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":726},{"uri":"Holotype","surface_form":"holotype","offset":786},{"uri":"Osteophytes","surface_form":"osteophytes","offset":943},{"uri":"Gastralia","surface_form":"gastralia","offset":989},{"uri":"False_joints","surface_form":"false joints","offset":1027},{"uri":"Bone_fracture","surface_form":"bone fracture","offset":1132}]}
