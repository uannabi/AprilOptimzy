{"id":442777,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaohusaurus","text":"\"Chaohusaurus\" is an extinct genus of basal ichthyopterygian, or ichthyosaur, from the Lower Triassic of Chaohu and Yuanan, China.\nIt was closer in time and form to \"Cymbospondylus\" and \"Mixosaurus\" than to more advanced genera like \"Ichthyosaurus\". It did not have the dolphin-like form of later ichthyosaurs, but it was fully aquatic. The tail fin is wide-based and short. The neck is rather long, whereas later ichthyosaurs have no neck. There is no dorsal fin.\nIt was one of the smallest ichthyosaurs, about 70 to 180\u00A0cm long. Its weight was about 10\u00A0kg.\nReproduction.\nIn other words, ichthyosaurs gave live birth when they were still land dwellers. Then, later, they adapted to an aquatic life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":21},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":29},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":38},{"uri":"Ichthyopterygia","surface_form":"ichthyopterygia","offset":44},{"uri":"Ichthyosaur","surface_form":"ichthyosaur","offset":65},{"uri":"Lower_Triassic","surface_form":"Lower Triassic","offset":87},{"uri":"Chaohu","surface_form":"Chaohu","offset":105},{"uri":"Yuanan","surface_form":"Yuanan","offset":116},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":124},{"uri":"Cymbospondylus","surface_form":"Cymbospondylus","offset":166},{"uri":"Mixosaurus","surface_form":"Mixosaurus","offset":187},{"uri":"Advanced","surface_form":"advanced","offset":212},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":221},{"uri":"Ichthyosaurus","surface_form":"Ichthyosaurus","offset":234},{"uri":"Dolphin","surface_form":"dolphin","offset":270},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":328},{"uri":"Adapted","surface_form":"adapted","offset":672},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":686}]}
