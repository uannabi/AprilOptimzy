It did not obtain fame until the 16th century, when its head, Antoine de Noailles (1504\u20131562), became admiral of France and was ambassador in England during three important years, 1553\u20131556, maintaining a gallant but unsuccessful rivalry with the Spanish ambassador, Simon Renard.\nHenri (1554\u20131623), son of Antoine, was a commander in the religious wars and was made Count of Ayen by Henry IV of France in 1593.\nThe title of Duke of Ayen was also given to the family.
