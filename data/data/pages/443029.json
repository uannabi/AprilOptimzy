In 2000, 138 people lived there. This town is near Georgetown.\nMany cypress cottages on Pawleys Island were built during the 20th century. That made people call the town \"arrogantly shabby\".

Some cottages were totally destroyed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":61},{"uri":"Georgetown%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Georgetown","offset":128},{"uri":"Cypress","surface_form":"cypress","offset":145},{"uri":"Hurricane_Hugo","surface_form":"Hurricane Hugo","offset":287}]}
