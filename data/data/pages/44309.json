{"id":44309,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecutive_integer","text":"e=\"preserve\">Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order. They have a difference of 1 between every two numbers. In a set of consecutive numbers, the mean and the median are equal.\nIf \"n\" is a number, then the next numbers will be \"n+1\" and \"n+2\".\nConsecutive even numbers.\nConsecutive even numbers are even numbers that follow each other. They have a difference of 2 between every two numbers.\nIf \"n\" is an even integer, then \"n,\" \"n\"+2, \"n\"+4 and \"n\"+6 will be consecutive even numbers.\nConsecutive odd numbers.\nConsecutive odd numbers are odd numbers that follow each other. Like consecutive odd numbers, they have a difference of 2 between every two numbers.\nIf \"n\" is an odd integer, then \"n,\" \"n\"+2, \"n\"+4 and \"n\"+6 will be consecutive odd numbers.\n3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, etc.\n\u221223, \u221221, \u221219, \u221217, \u221215, -13, -11","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":124},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":138},{"uri":"Mean","surface_form":"mean","offset":170},{"uri":"Median","surface_form":"median","offset":183},{"uri":"Equal","surface_form":"equal","offset":194},{"uri":"Even_number","surface_form":"even number","offset":323},{"uri":"Odd_number","surface_form":"odd number","offset":562}]}
