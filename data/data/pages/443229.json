{"id":443229,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol","text":"=\"preserve\">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network layer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address (called a DLC address), such as an Ethernet address. A host wishing to obtain a physical address broadcasts an ARP request onto the TCP/IP network. The host on the network that has the IP address in the request then replies with its physical hardware address.\nThere is also Reverse ARP (RARP) which can be used by a host to discover its IP address. In this case, the host broadcasts its physical address and a RARP server replies with the host's IP address.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
