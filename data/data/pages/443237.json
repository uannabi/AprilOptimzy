{"id":443237,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhill_School","text":"Summerhill School is an independent British boarding school which was founded in 1921 by A.S. Neill (Alexander Sutherland Neill). He believed the school should fit the child, not than the other way around.\nSummerhill is run as a democratic community. Decisions are made in school meetings, which anyone, staff or pupil, may attend, and at which everyone has an equal vote. These meetings serve as both a legislative and judicial body. Summerhill is the oldest \"children's democracy\" in the world. It is probably the most famous alternative or 'free' school.\nMembers of the community are free to do as they please, so long as their actions do not cause any harm to others, according to Neill's principle \"Freedom, not Licence\". This extends to the freedom for pupils to choose which lessons, if any, they attend.\nThe school is not large. It varies 6080 boys and girls with ages ranging from 5 to 17. The school is now owned by Zo\u00EB Readhead, the daughter of A.S. Neill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Boarding_school","surface_form":"boarding school","offset":44},{"uri":"Direct_democracy","surface_form":"democratic community","offset":229}]}
