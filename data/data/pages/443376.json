The Devils offered him a five-year contract worth $7.8 million per season (the maximum allowed under the new salary cap), but he decided to sign a four-year contract worth $6.75 million per season with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.

To be able to do that is definitely a highlight of my career.\" He was also able to win the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nHe retired from playing professional ice hockey on June 22, 2010.
