He began living in a neighbourhood of Dongdaemun District of Seoul.\nYun's nickname, Yook Woo Dang, means \"six friends\". It refers to alcohol, tobacco, sleeping pills, foundation make-up, green tea and rosary beads. His penname Sulheon came from Heo Chohui's nickname \"Nanseolheon\". Heo Chohui was a female poet and painter during the Joseon dynasty in Korea.\nIn 2002 and 2003, Yun became an activist for human rights and peace. In March 2003, he was a conscientious objector to South Korea's conscription military service. But his opinions did not matter to some Koreans, because of his sexuality. In early April 2003, some South Korean Christian organisations gave a statement against homosexuality. Yun spoke out against this and wrote an article to some South Korean newspapers and the foreign press.\nIn April 26, 2003, Yun committed suicide, in Dongdaemun in Seoul. He hanged himself. He did it to protest discrimination against gay people in South Korea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":57},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":70},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":111},{"uri":"Civil_rights","surface_form":"civil rights","offset":125},{"uri":"LGBT_rights","surface_form":"LGBT rights","offset":139},{"uri":"Incheon","surface_form":"Incheon","offset":377},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":400},{"uri":"Seoul","surface_form":"Seoul","offset":428},{"uri":"Came_out","surface_form":"came out","offset":568},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":580},{"uri":"Dongdaemun_District","surface_form":"Dongdaemun District","offset":706},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":801},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":810},{"uri":"Sleeping_pill","surface_form":"sleeping pill","offset":819},{"uri":"Foundation_(cosmetics)","surface_form":"foundation make-up","offset":835},{"uri":"Green_tea","surface_form":"green tea","offset":855},{"uri":"Rosary","surface_form":"rosary","offset":869},{"uri":"Heo_Chohui","surface_form":"Heo Chohui","offset":913},{"uri":"Joseon_dynasty","surface_form":"Joseon dynasty","offset":1002},{"uri":"Conscientious_objector","surface_form":"conscientious objector","offset":1120},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"conscription","offset":1160},{"uri":"Military_service","surface_form":"military service","offset":1173},{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"homosexuality","offset":1354},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":1505},{"uri":"Seoul","surface_form":"Seoul","offset":1531},{"uri":"Hanging","surface_form":"hanged","offset":1541},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":1570}]}
