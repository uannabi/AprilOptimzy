{"id":443808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Davids","text":"St Davids, or St David's, (, \u00A0\"David's house\"), is the smallest city in the United Kingdom, with about 1,841 people living there, as of the 2011 census. It is also a community called St Davids and the Cathedral Close. It is in Pembrokeshire, Wales on the River Alun. It is where Saint David is buried, who is the patron saint of Wales. St Davids first became a city in the 12th century, but it was demoted in 1886. In the UK, the monarch gives or takes away whether a place is a city or not. In 1994, Queen Elizabeth II made St Davids a city again.\nHistory.\nIn the 6th century, Saint David started a monastery and church on the banks of the River Alun at a place called Glyn Rhosyn (Rose Vale). The area was first called \"Mynyw\" in Welsh. The Romans called it \"Meneva\" or \"Menevia\". The people of the monastery grew food and did other crafts, like beekeeping. They also fed the poor.\nThe area that grew around the monastery became known in Welsh as \"Tyddewi\", which means \"David's house\". In 519, the archbishop of Caerleon was moved to the monastery. \"Tyddewi\" was renamed \"St Davids\" in name of the saint who founded the place. The first cathedral that was built was attacked many times by the Vikings, and burned down in 1087. The cathedral that is there now was built by the Normans. Many pilgrims travelled to St Davids because Saint David was from there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saint_David","surface_form":"David","offset":31},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":39},{"uri":"City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"city","offset":64},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":76},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":145},{"uri":"Pembrokeshire","surface_form":"Pembrokeshire","offset":227},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":242},{"uri":"River_Alun%2C_Pembrokeshire","surface_form":"River Alun","offset":255},{"uri":"Saint_David","surface_form":"Saint David","offset":279},{"uri":"Patron_saint","surface_form":"patron saint","offset":313},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":373},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Elizabeth II","offset":507},{"uri":"6th_century","surface_form":"6th century","offset":565},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastery","offset":600},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":614},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":732},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":743},{"uri":"Beekeeping","surface_form":"beekeeping","offset":848},{"uri":"Archbishop","surface_form":"archbishop","offset":1001},{"uri":"Caerleon","surface_form":"Caerleon","offset":1015},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":1140},{"uri":"Vikings","surface_form":"Vikings","offset":1196},{"uri":"Normans","surface_form":"Normans","offset":1279},{"uri":"Pilgrimage","surface_form":"pilgrims","offset":1293}]}
