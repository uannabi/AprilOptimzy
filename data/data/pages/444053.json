For most Canadians, several (or all) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being \"Canadian\". Most people who are considered \"Canadian\" are usually those who have Canadian Citizenship.\nCanada is a bilingual and multicultural society home to people of many different ethnic, religious and national origins, with the majority of the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants.\nBackground.\nFollowing the starting period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity.\nCanada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["ethnic group"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":55},{"uri":"Multiculturalism","surface_form":"multicultural","offset":370},{"uri":"Old_World","surface_form":"Old World","offset":512},{"uri":"New_France","surface_form":"French","offset":601},{"uri":"British_colonization_of_the_Americas","surface_form":"British colonization","offset":633},{"uri":"Culture_of_Canada","surface_form":"culture of Canada","offset":935},{"uri":"Canadian_identity","surface_form":"Canadian identity","offset":964},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1082}]}
