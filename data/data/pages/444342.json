His most important work, \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", was published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788. The \"Decline and Fall\" is known for the quality and irony of its prose, its use of primary sources, and its open criticism of Christianity. He was educated at Westminster School. He died of peritonitis in London.\nHis response to criticism.\nHis attack on Christianity caused several opponents to publish pamphlets against him. Gibbon defended his work with the 1779 publication of, \"A Vindication... of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\".
