He was born in Bordeaux, and became his father's successor when his elder brother died in infancy. His father died before him, so he became king in 1377. His uncle John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster became regent until Richard II could rule. He was deposed by Henry of Bolingbroke (Henry IV), John of Gaunt's son with Blanche of Lancaster, taken prisoner and later died in captivity.\nRichard abdicated (resigned) in 1399. He was murdered later that year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Edward%2C_the_Black_Prince","surface_form":"Edward, the Black Prince","offset":60},{"uri":"Joan_of_Kent","surface_form":"Joan of Kent","offset":107},{"uri":"Bordeaux","surface_form":"Bordeaux","offset":161},{"uri":"Infant","surface_form":"infancy","offset":236},{"uri":"Henry_IV","surface_form":"Henry IV","offset":430},{"uri":"Abdication","surface_form":"abdicated","offset":540}]}
