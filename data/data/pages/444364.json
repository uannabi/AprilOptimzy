{"id":444364,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailstrike","text":"A tailstrike is when the tail of an airplane hits the runway. This can happen during takeoff or landing. During takeoff, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too early and the plane cannot take off in time. During a landing, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too high during landing.\nTailstrikes usually do not have serious effects, such as killing people. However, this means that the airline has to spend money to repair the plane before it can fly again. If the plane is not repaired correctly, it may cause metal fatigue and in the end, the plane can crash.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":36},{"uri":"Runway","surface_form":"runway","offset":54},{"uri":"Takeoff","surface_form":"takeoff","offset":85},{"uri":"Landing","surface_form":"landing","offset":96},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":152},{"uri":"Airline","surface_form":"airline","offset":421},{"uri":"Fatigue_(material)","surface_form":"metal fatigue","offset":546}]}
