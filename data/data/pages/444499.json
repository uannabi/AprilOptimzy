{"id":444499,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuvier%27s_beaked_whale","text":"Cuvier's beaked whale (\"Ziphius cavirostris\"), is the only member of the genus \"Ziphius\". It is the most widely distributed of all the beaked whales.\nHistory of discovery.\nThe French anatomist Georges Cuvier, in his \"Sur les Ossemens fossiles\" (1823), first described the species based on an imperfect skull from the Mediterranean coast of France. A peasant had found it on the shore in 1803.\nCuvier named it \"Ziphius cavirostris\". The specific name comes from the Latin \"cavus\" for \"hollow\" or \"concave\". This refers to the deep hollow in the skull, a diagnostic trait of the species. Cuvier believed it was an extinct species. In 1850 zoologists realized the species was still living, when Paul Gervais compared the type specimen to a whale stranded at Aresqui\u00E8s, H\u00E9rault. He found the two to be identical.\nPrey.\nCuvier's beaked whale feeds on several species of squid. They also prey on deep-sea fish. On March 27 2014 a Cuvier's beaked whale tracked by a satellite-linked tag set a new deep diving record for a sea mammal, plunging nearly two miles below the ocean surface.\nAlthough it is in the Odontoceti, it has little use for teeth. As adults, two incisors at the front of the lower jaw stick forward. Basically, it sucks in prey by expanding its throat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":73},{"uri":"Beaked_whale","surface_form":"beaked whale","offset":135},{"uri":"Georges_Cuvier","surface_form":"Georges Cuvier","offset":193},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":302},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":317},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":340},{"uri":"Diagnostic","surface_form":"diagnostic","offset":553},{"uri":"Trait_(biology)","surface_form":"trait","offset":564},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":612},{"uri":"Paul_Gervais","surface_form":"Paul Gervais","offset":692},{"uri":"Type_specimen","surface_form":"type specimen","offset":718},{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":865},{"uri":"Odontoceti","surface_form":"Odontoceti","offset":1100},{"uri":"Incisor","surface_form":"incisor","offset":1156},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":1191},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":1255}]}
