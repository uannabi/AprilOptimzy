{"id":444758,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cordillera","text":"The American Cordillera is a chain of mountain ranges. It is the western \"backbone\" of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica. It is also the volcanic arc that forms the eastern half of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\nThe ranges begin with the Alaska Range and the Brooks Range in Alaska and run through the Yukon into British Columbia. The main belt of the Rocky Mountains along with the parallel Coast Ranges of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and Vancouver Island.\nIn the United States, the cordillera branches to include the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascades and Coast ranges of Washington, Oregon, and California. In Mexico, the cordillera continues through the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental, as well as the backbone mountains of the Baja California peninsula.\nThe ranges of the cordillera from Mexico northwards are called the North American Cordillera or Western Cordillera in the United States and Canada, and the Canadian Cordillera or Pacific Cordillera in Canada.\nThe cordillera goes on through the mountain ranges of Central America in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. It becomes the Andes Mountains of South America. The Andes with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of Chile continue through Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile to the very tip of South America at Tierra del Fuego. Also, the range may be followed through the South Georgia Ridge across the Southern Ocean to the mountains of Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula.\nCausation.\nThe cause of this remarkable geographical feature was the movement of the Americas away from the supercontinent of Pangaea. This began 200 million years ago.\nThe movement also explains the low-lying swamp features on the Eastern side of the two continents (most notably in in Miami and Brazil).\nThis great feature is sometimes called the Continental Divide of the Americas. This refers to the drainage basins of the two continents.\nThe Nazca plate.\nThis oceanic tectonic plate sits east of South America and is moving under it. It is mainly responsible for the Andean mpuntain range. The subduction of the Nazca plate under southern Chile produced the largest earthquake ever recorded on Earth, the moment magnitude 9.5 1960 Valdivia earthquake.\nCalifornia.\nCalifornia formed as a series of small island arcs, plus ocean sediments and oceanic crust. They were stuck to the western edge of North America, producing a series of deep basins and high mountain ranges. The oldest rocks date back to the Proterozoic era 1.8 billion years ago.\nDuring the Cenozoic, rock was stuck (\"accreted\") to the edge of California. Vast areas of marine sedimentary rocks were deposited. Examples of filled basins included the Los Angeles Basin, the Eel River Basin around Eureka and the 50,000 foot thick sedimentary sequences of the Ventura Basin. The San Andreas Fault became most active after the Miocene. It had up to 350 miles of offset in some places.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":38},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":87},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":102},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":119},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":137},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic arc","offset":164},{"uri":"Pacific_Ring_of_Fire","surface_form":"Pacific Ring of Fire","offset":212},{"uri":"Alaska_Range","surface_form":"Alaska Range","offset":260},{"uri":"Brooks_Range","surface_form":"Brooks Range","offset":281},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":297},{"uri":"Yukon","surface_form":"Yukon","offset":324},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":335},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":374},{"uri":"Pacific_Coast_Ranges","surface_form":"Coast Ranges","offset":414},{"uri":"Vancouver_Island","surface_form":"Vancouver Island","offset":490},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":515},{"uri":"Sierra_Nevada_(US)","surface_form":"Sierra Nevada","offset":590},{"uri":"Cascade_Range","surface_form":"Cascades","offset":613},{"uri":"Washington","surface_form":"Washington","offset":642},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":654},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":666},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":681},{"uri":"Sierra_Madre_Occidental","surface_form":"Sierra Madre Occidental","offset":726},{"uri":"Sierra_Madre_Oriental","surface_form":"Sierra Madre Oriental","offset":754},{"uri":"Baja_California_peninsula","surface_form":"Baja California peninsula","offset":818},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1108},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":1127},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":1138},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":1148},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":1159},{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":1175},{"uri":"Andes_Mountains","surface_form":"Andes Mountains","offset":1198},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1217},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1308},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":1331},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":1341},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":1352},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":1361},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":1367},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1376},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1391},{"uri":"Tierra_del_Fuego","surface_form":"Tierra del Fuego","offset":1433},{"uri":"South_Georgia","surface_form":"South Georgia","offset":1495},{"uri":"Graham_Land","surface_form":"Graham Land","offset":1561},{"uri":"Antarctic_Peninsula","surface_form":"Antarctic Peninsula","offset":1580},{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":1709},{"uri":"Pangaea","surface_form":"Pangaea","offset":1727},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":1811},{"uri":"Miami","surface_form":"Miami","offset":1888},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1898},{"uri":"Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas","surface_form":"Continental Divide of the Americas","offset":1950},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":2005},{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":2074},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andean","offset":2173},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":2272},{"uri":"Moment_magnitude_scale","surface_form":"moment magnitude","offset":2311},{"uri":"1960_Valdivia_earthquake","surface_form":"1960 Valdivia earthquake","offset":2332},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":2409},{"uri":"Proterozoic","surface_form":"Proterozoic","offset":2610},{"uri":"Cenozoic","surface_form":"Cenozoic","offset":2660},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":2819},{"uri":"Eel_River","surface_form":"Eel River","offset":2842},{"uri":"Ventura_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Ventura Basin","offset":2927},{"uri":"San_Andreas_Fault","surface_form":"San Andreas Fault","offset":2946},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":2993}]}
