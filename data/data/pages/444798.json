{"id":444798,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector","text":"e=\"preserve\">A unit vector is any vector that is one unit in length. Unit vectors are often notated the same way as normal vectors, but with a mark over the letter (e.g. formula_1 being the unit vector of formula_1.)\nTo make a vector into a unit vector, one just needs to divide it by its length: formula_1. The resulting unit vector will be in the same direction as the original vector.\nIn component form.\nThree common unit vectors used in component form are formula_1, formula_1 and formula_1, referring to the three-dimensional unit vectors for the x-, y- and z-axes, respectively. They are commonly just notated as i, j and k.\nformula_1\nFor the unit vector corresponding to the formula_1-th basis vector of a vector space, the symbol formula_1 (or formula_1) may be used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":34},{"uri":"Three-dimensional","surface_form":"three-dimensional","offset":513},{"uri":"Basis_vector","surface_form":"basis vector","offset":695},{"uri":"Vector_space","surface_form":"vector space","offset":713}]}
