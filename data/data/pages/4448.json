{"id":4448,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mental_illness)","text":"Depression (also called major depressive disorder, unipolar depression or clinical depression) is a mental illness. Many people think that depression just means a person is very sad. However, depression can cause many symptoms in the body as well as mood problems.\nDiagnosis.\nThe ICD-10 is used around the world to diagnose people with illnesses like depression. According to the ICD-10, for a person to be diagnosed with depression, their symptoms have to last for at least two weeks. The symptoms must happen every day, or almost every day. These symptoms also have to cause problems in a person's life (like their work life, family life, social life, or other important parts of their life).\nMost people who have not had depression do not completely understand its effects. Instead, they see it as simply being sad. Since it is not understood, many people criticize people with depression for not helping themselves.\nSome people with depression die by suicide. Depression is one of the mental illnesses that can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts.\nIn different cultures.\nMajor depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States. In 2014, 15.7 million adults in the United States had at least one episode of major depression. This is about 6.7% of all adults in the United States.\nAround the world, depression causes more disability than any other mental health or behavioral illness, according to the World Health Organization.\nHowever, the prevalence of depression is different in different cultures and countries.\nPrince (1968) found virtually no depression in most Asian and African countries. However, psychologists such as Zhang and Kleinman have found disorders with similar symptoms, but different names. For example, in the 1980s, Zhang found that in China, there was little mention of depression. However, instead, a disorder called Neurasthenia was far more common. When interviewing Neurasthenia patients, Zhang found that their symptoms matched the symptoms of depression by over 80%. While the term \"depression\" was practically unheard of in China, Neurasthenia could well have been a similar disorder \u2013 or the same thing.\nIt is also important to take in different cultures ways of classifying depression. For example, in China, many people believe doctors solve physical symptoms, not mental problems. This may have made it more likely for \"depression\" to be diagnosed as a medical condition like \"Neurasthenia.\"\nIn men and women.\nTypically, in most Western cultures, women are diagnosed with depression twice as often as men. However, men are often more likely than women to die by suicide.\nDepression in children.\nDepression in children can be harder to see. Children who are depressed may have a loss of appetite, meaning that they do not want to eat. They may also be clearly having more trouble in everyday life than before. For example, they may have sleep problems like nightmares; new problems with behaviour or grades at school; or be more irritable than usual.\nTypes of depression.\nMajor depressive disorder is also referred to as \"major, biochemical, clinical, endogenous\", or \"biological depression\". It may also be called \"unipolar affective disorder\".\nCauses of depression.\nThe United States National Institutes of Health say that depression comes from the brain. However, scientists are still trying to find out exactly why it happens.\nPossible causes.\nSome depressed people also have other mental disorders, such as personality disorders and anxiety disorders.\nTreatment.\nDepression is usually treated with a combination of medication and other therapy. Good exercise helps deal with depression, since exercise releases chemicals that put a person in a better mood. Having a supportive group of friends and doing outside activities can also help prevent or ease depression.\nMedication.\nIf people with depression do not take their medicine the right way, the depression can get worse. A doctor must help when they want to change to another medication, or to take a different amount of a medication than before.\nPsychotherapy.\nPsychotherapy is often a helpful treatment for depression. In psychotherapy, a therapist helps a person to understand and solve problems which cause depression. The therapist also helps the person learn skills for dealing with their depression.\nPsychotherapy can help a person make changes in the way they think, in order to help with life problems and understand what makes depression worse. The most effective psychotherapy for depression is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This teaches a person to think in a more rational, positive, realistic manner.\nSurgeries and procedures.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called electroshock therapy or shock therapy, is used to treat a small percentage of severely depressed people. ECT uses a small amount of electricity to cause an epileptic seizure while the patient is under anesthesia. This may cause some memory loss (amnesia) or other side effects.\nPet therapy.\nPet therapy and animal companionship can help people suffering from depression or anxiety.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illness","offset":100},{"uri":"Sadness","surface_form":"sad","offset":178},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":218},{"uri":"Mood","surface_form":"mood","offset":250},{"uri":"ICD-10","surface_form":"ICD-10","offset":280},{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosed","offset":407},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":955},{"uri":"Disability","surface_form":"disability","offset":1354},{"uri":"World_Health_Organization","surface_form":"World Health Organization","offset":1434},{"uri":"Prevalence","surface_form":"prevalence","offset":1474},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":2677},{"uri":"Appetite","surface_form":"appetite","offset":2754},{"uri":"Nightmare","surface_form":"nightmare","offset":2924},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":2977},{"uri":"National_Institutes_of_Health","surface_form":"National Institutes of Health","offset":3253},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":3334},{"uri":"Personality_disorder","surface_form":"personality disorder","offset":3479},{"uri":"Anxiety_disorder","surface_form":"anxiety disorder","offset":3505},{"uri":"Psychotherapy","surface_form":"Psychotherapy","offset":4088},{"uri":"Psychotherapy","surface_form":"psychotherapy","offset":4150},{"uri":"Cognitive_behavioral_therapy","surface_form":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","offset":4532},{"uri":"Electroconvulsive_therapy","surface_form":"Electroconvulsive therapy","offset":4673},{"uri":"Electroshock_therapy","surface_form":"electroshock therapy","offset":4718},{"uri":"Shock_therapy","surface_form":"shock therapy","offset":4742},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":4850},{"uri":"Epileptic_seizure","surface_form":"epileptic seizure","offset":4874},{"uri":"Anesthesia","surface_form":"anesthesia","offset":4919},{"uri":"Amnesia","surface_form":"amnesia","offset":4964}]}
