{"id":444937,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration","text":"e=\"preserve\">Molar concentration, or molarity, or simply concentration, is a term in physical chemistry. It measures the concentration of a solution or mixture.\nThe volume formula_1 in the definition formula_1 refers to the volume of the solution, \"not\" the volume of the solvent. One litre of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 litre of solvent because when a substance dissolves in a solvent it causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease.\nThe reciprocal quantity represents the dilution (volume) which can appear in Ostwald's law of dilution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Concentration","surface_form":"concentration","offset":57},{"uri":"Physical_chemistry","surface_form":"physical chemistry","offset":85},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":140},{"uri":"Mixture","surface_form":"mixture","offset":152},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":238},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":272},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"litre","offset":367},{"uri":"Reciprocal","surface_form":"reciprocal","offset":488},{"uri":"Dilution","surface_form":"dilution","offset":523},{"uri":"Law_of_dilution","surface_form":"law of dilution","offset":571}]}
