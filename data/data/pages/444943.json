{"id":444943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basement_(geology)","text":"=\"preserve\">In geology, the terms basement and crystalline basement are used to define the rocks below a sedimentary platform or cover. \"The surface beneath which no sedimentary rock is found\".\nMore generally, it is any rock below sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are metamorphic or igneous in origin.
