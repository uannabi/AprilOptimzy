Under Blair's leadership the party abandoned many policies it had held for decades. Labour won a landslide victory in the 1997 general election, which ended 18 years of Conservative rule with the heaviest Conservative defeat since 1832.\nHe was the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister and the only leader to have taken the party to three uninterrupted general election victories.\nGordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer during all Blair's ten years in office, succeeded him as party leader and Prime Minister in 2007.\nEarly life.\nBlair was born at Queen Mary Maternity Home in Edinburgh on 6 May 1953.

Blair is the first and only Labour Party leader to have won three general elections in a row.\nHe attributes his success in politics to a pair of \"lucky brogues\", which he wore for every single Prime Minister's Questions of his leadership.
