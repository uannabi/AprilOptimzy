{"id":44500,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscovium","text":"Moscovium is a chemical element. It is also named eka-bismuth. It has the symbol Mc. It has the atomic number 115. It is a superheavy element.\nMoscovium does not exist in nature. It is a synthetic element, made from a fusion reaction between americium and calcium.\nThe element is named in honor of Russian city Moscow.\nMoscovium is in the center of the theoretical island of stability. No stable isotopes of moscovium have yet been found. Models predict that the stable isotope of ununpentium should have 184 neutrons. The stable isotope with 184 neutrons is 299Uup. The isotope that has been made has only 173 neutrons (288Uup).\nHistory.\nOn February 2, 2004 a report that moscovium and nihonium were made was written in a journal named Physical Review C. The report was written by a team of Russian scientists at Dubna University's Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and American scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.,\nThese people reported that they bombarded americium with calcium to make four atoms of moscovium.\nScientists of Japan also report that they have made moscovium.\nIn May 2006 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research this element was made by another method and what the final products from radioactive decay were was found by chemical analysis.\nName.\nThe name was changed to Moscovium. It used to be named ununpentium\nChemical properties.\nNot enough moscovium has been made to measure its physical or chemical properties. It is thought that it would be a hard metal. It may be slightly colored.\nMoscovium is in the same group as bismuth but its chemical properties will be different. The chemistry of ununpentium will be very influenced by special relativity. It will make its properties different to the other elements in the periodic table that have a smaller atomic number. One important difference from bismuth is the presence of a stable oxidation state of +I (Uup+). The (Uup+) ion is thought to have chemical properties like Tl+.\nIn popular culture.\nMoscovium is inside the island of stability. This is probably why it is found in popular culture. It is more likely to be talked about in UFO conspiracy theories.\nThe most popular story about moscovium is from Bob Lazar. It is not pseudoscience because it is a refutable theory, however Lazar's claims are not backed by any direct experimental evidence at this time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":15},{"uri":"Mendeleev%27s_predicted_elements","surface_form":"eka","offset":50},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":96},{"uri":"Synthetic_element","surface_form":"synthetic element","offset":187},{"uri":"Nuclear_fusion","surface_form":"fusion","offset":218},{"uri":"Americium","surface_form":"americium","offset":242},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":256},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":311},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":353},{"uri":"Island_of_stability","surface_form":"island of stability","offset":365},{"uri":"Stable","surface_form":"stable","offset":389},{"uri":"Isotopes","surface_form":"isotopes","offset":396},{"uri":"Model","surface_form":"Model","offset":439},{"uri":"Prediction","surface_form":"predict","offset":446},{"uri":"Neutrons","surface_form":"neutrons","offset":509},{"uri":"February_2","surface_form":"February 2","offset":642},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":654},{"uri":"Report","surface_form":"report","offset":661},{"uri":"Nihonium","surface_form":"nihonium","offset":687},{"uri":"Discovery_of_the_chemical_elements","surface_form":"made","offset":701},{"uri":"Journal","surface_form":"journal","offset":723},{"uri":"Physical_Review","surface_form":"Physical Review","offset":737},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":792},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":800},{"uri":"Dubna","surface_form":"Dubna","offset":814},{"uri":"Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","surface_form":"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research","offset":833},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":874},{"uri":"Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory","surface_form":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","offset":901},{"uri":"Bombardment","surface_form":"bombarded","offset":974},{"uri":"Americium","surface_form":"americium","offset":984},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":999},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":1020},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1054},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1110},{"uri":"Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","surface_form":"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research","offset":1122},{"uri":"Radioactive_decay","surface_form":"radioactive decay","offset":1232},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemical","offset":1268},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":1277},{"uri":"Physical_property","surface_form":"physical","offset":1431},{"uri":"Chemical_property","surface_form":"chemical","offset":1443},{"uri":"Bismuth","surface_form":"bismuth","offset":1571},{"uri":"Chemical_property","surface_form":"chemical properties","offset":1587},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":1668},{"uri":"Special_relativity","surface_form":"special relativity","offset":1682},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":1885},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":1926},{"uri":"Thallium","surface_form":"Tl","offset":1974},{"uri":"Island_of_stability","surface_form":"island of stability","offset":2023},{"uri":"Popular_culture","surface_form":"popular culture","offset":2080},{"uri":"UFO","surface_form":"UFO","offset":2137},{"uri":"Conspiracy_theory","surface_form":"conspiracy theories","offset":2141},{"uri":"Pseudoscience","surface_form":"pseudoscience","offset":2230}]}
