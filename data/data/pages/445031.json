It is measured by a unit of speed.\nMost of the time, a propellant burned by an engine provides the needed thrust.\nDelta-v is calculated in meters per second of thrust, or m/s.\nFor example, to reach Low Earth orbit, (LEO) a spacecraft generally needs about 9,300 to 10,000 m/s of thrust.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astrodynamics","surface_form":"astrodynamics","offset":58},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":78},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"space","offset":97},{"uri":"Trajectory","surface_form":"trajectory","offset":184},{"uri":"Propellant","surface_form":"propellant","offset":297},{"uri":"Rocket_engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":321},{"uri":"Thrust","surface_form":"thrust","offset":348},{"uri":"Low_Earth_orbit","surface_form":"Low Earth orbit","offset":440}]}
