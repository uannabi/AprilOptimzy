It goes from New Westminster to north bank of the river to the city of Surrey.\nThe bridge was opened in 1937. On January 18, 2009, there was a fire that started on the south end of the bridge in the structure under the bridge deck. The 60-foot long wooden trestle on the south side of the bridge which connects the steel and concrete structure to the earthen berm was burned and needed to be entirely rebuilt. The investigators treated the fire as suspicious. The bridge was reopened on January 26.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Through_arch_bridge","surface_form":"through arch bridge","offset":27},{"uri":"Fraser_River","surface_form":"Fraser River","offset":69},{"uri":"New_Westminster","surface_form":"New Westminster","offset":96},{"uri":"Surrey%2C_British_Columbia","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":154},{"uri":"1937","surface_form":"1937","offset":187},{"uri":"Trestle","surface_form":"trestle","offset":339}]}
