{"id":4453,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne","text":"Acne is an infection of the skin, caused by changes in the sebaceous glands. The most common form of acne is called acne vulgaris, which means \"common acne\". The redness comes from the inflammation of the skin in response to the infection.\nOils from the glands combine with dead skin cells to block hair follicles. Under the blocked pore, oil builds up. Skin bacteria can then grow very quickly. This infection makes the skin become swollen and red, which becomes visible.\nThe face, chest, back, and upper arms are most common places for acne to happen.\nAcne is common during puberty, when a person is turning from a child into an adult, because of high levels of hormones. Acne becomes less common as people reach adulthood.\nThere are lots of acne treatment methods available, including natural treatments.\nEffects of acne.\nPeople of all ages can get acne, although it occurs more commonly in adolescents. Acne can affect people physically, psychologically, and socially.\nPhysical effects.\nAcne causes scarring, and acne pustules can be very painful and sensitive.\nPsychological effects.\nPeople suffering from a bad case of acne, especially adolescents, can develop low self-esteem which can lead to depression.\nSocial effects.\nLow self-esteem issues can make a person suffering from acne withdraw from many social events. It makes developing new personal relationships (especially love relationships) more difficult. Low self-esteem can also cause problems with career advancement as the person may find it difficult to present a positive attitude. This may sometimes even lead to suicidal thoughts. Some of the treatments for acne have also shown a link with more suicide attempts.\nCauses of acne.\nAspirin reduces inflammation which in result, reduces facial redness due to acne.\nTreatments.\nMany things are sold to treat acne, the most popular being benzoyl peroxide. Many of these things have not been scientifically proven to help acne. However, a mix of commercial and homemade treatments can help with acne for various reasons.\nPopping a pimple should not be done by anyone but a qualified dermatologist. Pimple popping irritates skin, can make the bacteria spread, and can cause scars. If you must pop a pimple yourself, it is advised to apply warm water to the area before popping it and to wash your hand thoroughly before beginning so as to avoid spreading bacteria via the hands. Applying hot water will open up the pores and reduce the damage because it will require less force to pop it.\nEpidemiology.\nThere are 650 million people in the world with acne, which is around 9.4% of the global population. More females are getting acne than males (9.8% versus 9.0%). Acne affects 40 to 50 million people in the United States (16%) and approximately 3 to 5 million in Australia (23%). Acne affects people of all ethnic groups.\nAcne scars.\nBad acne often leads to bad scars where the skin has the shape of a volcano. It is difficult and expensive to treat acne scars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":28},{"uri":"Sebaceous_gland","surface_form":"sebaceous gland","offset":59},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":254},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":284},{"uri":"Hair_follicle","surface_form":"hair follicle","offset":299},{"uri":"Face","surface_form":"face","offset":477},{"uri":"Chest","surface_form":"chest","offset":483},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"back","offset":490},{"uri":"Arm","surface_form":"arm","offset":506},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":576},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":664},{"uri":"Self-esteem","surface_form":"self-esteem","offset":1171},{"uri":"Clinical_depression","surface_form":"depression","offset":1201},{"uri":"Benzoyl_peroxide","surface_form":"benzoyl peroxide","offset":1854},{"uri":"Dermatologist","surface_form":"dermatologist","offset":2098},{"uri":"Scar","surface_form":"scar","offset":2877}]}
