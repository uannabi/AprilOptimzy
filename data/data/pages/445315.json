{"id":445315,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map","text":"=\"preserve\">The Marauder's Map is a fictional map of Hogwarts. It is a magical map. It was created by Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima but was also know to be created by James \u201CProngs\u201D Potter, Sirius \u201CPadfoot\u201D Black, Peter \u201CWormtail\u201D Pettigrew and Remus \u201CMoony\u201D Lupin. It showed the secret passages in and out of Hogwarts. The map also showed where people are by the use of named dots. The map can be viewed by saying \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good\". The map can be made invisible (only the parchment will be seen) if one says \"mischief managed\" and taps a wand on the parchment.\nThe map was found by one of the Weasleys which is then handed over to Harry Potter.\nThis map was later used by Minerva McGonagall to help Harry Potter save his child Albus Severus Potter, in \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":46},{"uri":"Hogwarts","surface_form":"Hogwarts","offset":53},{"uri":"Harry_Potter","surface_form":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child","offset":782}]}
