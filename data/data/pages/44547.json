After a year, Wham changed its image with the release of their second album Make it Big, which was a critical and commercial success, hitting #1 in both the UK and the USA. It produced four singles, all topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. One of the most popular songs in the album, \"Careless Whisper,\" Michael's first solo single, was released in 1984 while he was still performing with Wham!. In 1986, Wham! disbanded after release of a third studio album, single and concert at Wembley Stadium.\nFollowing his split with Wham!, George Michael began a successful solo career, releasing four studio albums, \"Faith\" (1987), \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\" (1991), \"Older\" (1996), and \"Patience\" (2004). Michael has sold over 100 million records worldwide as of 2010, encompassing 11 British #1 singles, 9 British #1 albums, 10 US #1 singles, and 2 US #1 album. His 1987 debut solo album, \"Faith\" has sold over 20\u00A0million copies worldwide alone and its considered by some music critics to be one of the greatest albums in pop music history.

This single became the UK Christmas number one on the UK Singles Chart in December 1984. Michael's own song, \"Last Christmas\" by Wham!, was held at number two. \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" sold 3.75\u00A0million copies in the UK. It became the biggest selling single in UK Chart history. It held this position until 1997 when it was overtaken by Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", released in tribute to Princess Diana following her death Michael also attended Diana's funeral with Elton John. Michael donated the royalties from \"Last Christmas\" to Band Aid and subsequently sang with Elton John at Live Aid (the Band Aid charity concert) in 1985.\nPersonal life.\nMichael was born in London to an English mother and Greek father. Michael was raised there and in Hertfordshire. He was initially private about being homosexual. During his \"Wham!\" career, he was in relationships with well-known women such as actress Brooke Shields, and model Pat Fernandes. Between 1986-1988, he was romantically involved with Kathy Yueng, an American makeup artist who was featured in \"I Want Your Sex\" Music Video. Nonetheless, his sexual orientation was well known among London music business people.\nThese persisted into his solo career, but Michael had already established a relationship with Anselmo Feleppa, whom he had met at the 1991 concert \"Rock in Rio\". Feleppa died of an AIDS-related brain hemorrhage in 1993. Michael's single \"Jesus to a Child\" is a tribute to Feleppa: (he consistently dedicates it to him before performing it live), as is his 1996 album \"Older\". Since 1996, Michael has been in a long-term relationship with businessman Kenny Goss. They have homes in London and Dallas.\nDeath.\nOn 25 December 2016 before 17:24 GMT, Michael died at his property in Goring, Oxfordshire, England from heart failure and a fatty liver, aged 53.
