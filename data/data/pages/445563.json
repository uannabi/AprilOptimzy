Topsham is where the Topsham Fair happens every year.\nHistory.\nThe Pejepscot Abenaki Indians, a sub-tribe of the Anasagunticooks (now Androscoggins), used to own the land that is now Topsham. They called the this area \"Sawacook.\" The Pejepscot Abenaki controlled the Androscoggin River. They lived and fished at Pejepscot Falls. But a plague, probably smallpox brought by Europeans, killed most of the tribe's population in 1615-1616.\nOn June 16, 1632, the Plymouth Council gave some land that had once belonged to the Abenaki to Thomas Purchase and George Way. The land was later given to Richard Wharton, and then in 1714 it was given to the Pejepscot Company.\nThe first sawmill there was built in 1716 on the Cathance River.\nIn 1717 the area got its current name, Topsham. It is named after the town of Topsham in Devon, England. On January 31, 1764, Topsham was incorporated as a town by the Massachusetts General Court.\nShipbuilding and lumber mills were important early businesses in Topsham. Pejepscot Falls provided the power to support industry. Lumber mills were very active between 1750 and 1770. Factories later produced things like lumber, watches, doors and pottery.\nTopsham and Brunswick were connected with the Underground Railroad during the years of slavery. There were safe houses and underground tunnels to hide escaped slaves in both towns. http://www.curtislibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FACTS-AND-LEGENDS-THE-UNDERGROUND-RR.pdf\nThe Brunswick and Topsham Water District was incorporated in 1903.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of, of which is land and is water.
