{"id":4456,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age","text":"The Stone Age was a prehistoric time when people made tools from stone. Wood, bones, and other materials were also used for tools, but those things don't last as long, so more stone tools are found. Stone (especially a hard kind of stone called flint) was used to cut things.\nThe period began with the first stone tools, about 2.7 million years ago. Some groups of people were still in the stone age into the 20th century. They also killed animals for food and clothing. They used animal skin for their shelters.\nThe time after the Stone Age is the Bronze Age, named after the metal bronze. The Stone Age ended when people discovered the art of smelting (making metals). The first metal used was copper, followed by bronze. People probably began using bronze instead of just stone in the Middle East sometime between 3000 and 2000 BC.\nThe Stone Age is divided by archaeologist<nowiki/>s (people who study relics) into three sections: Paleolithic (\"old stone\"), Mesolithic (\"middle stone\"), and Neolithic (\"new stone\"). Pottery was invented during the Neolithic Stone Age.\nThe Palaeolithic is a prehistoric era distinguished by the development of stone tools. It covers the greatest portion of humanity's time (roughly 99% of human history) on Earth, from about 2.7 million years ago to about 20,000 years ago. It was followed by the Mesolithic and Neolithic cultures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"Wood","offset":72},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":78},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":245},{"uri":"Stone_tool","surface_form":"stone tool","offset":308},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":331},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":339},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":549},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":577},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":583},{"uri":"Metallurgy","surface_form":"smelting","offset":645},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":696},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":788},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":863},{"uri":"Paleolithic","surface_form":"Paleolithic","offset":934},{"uri":"Mesolithic","surface_form":"Mesolithic","offset":961},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":994},{"uri":"Pottery","surface_form":"Pottery","offset":1019},{"uri":"Palaeolithic","surface_form":"Palaeolithic","offset":1076},{"uri":"Prehistory","surface_form":"prehistoric","offset":1094},{"uri":"Stone_tool","surface_form":"stone tool","offset":1146},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":1243},{"uri":"Mesolithic","surface_form":"Mesolithic","offset":1333},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":1348}]}
