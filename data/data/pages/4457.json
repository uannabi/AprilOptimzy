{"id":4457,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler","text":"Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 \u2013 30 April 1945) was a German politician and the leader of Nazi Germany. He became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, after a democratic election in 1932. He became \"F\u00FChrer\" (leader) of Nazi Germany in 1934.\nHitler led the Nazi Party NSDAP from 1921. When in power the Nazis created a dictatorship called the Third Reich. In 1933, they blocked out all other political parties. This gave Hitler absolute power.\nHitler ordered the invasion of Poland in 1939, and this started World War II. Because of Hitler, at least 50 million people died. During World War II, Hitler was the Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces and made all the important decisions. This was part of the so-called \"F\u00FChrerprinzip\". He shot himself in 1945, as the Soviet Army got to Berlin, because he did not want to be captured alive by the Soviet Union.\nHitler and the Nazi regime were responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in Europe.\nNazi forces committed many war crimes during the war. They were doing what Hitler told them to do. They killed their enemies or put them in concentration camps and death camps. Hitler and his men persecuted and killed Jews and other ethnic, religious, and political minorities. In what is called the Holocaust, the Nazis killed six million Jews, Roma people, homosexuals, Slavs, and many other groups of people.\nFamily background.\nHitler's family was born in Waldviertel, in Lower Austria. At the time, the name \"Hitler\" changed in this region several times between \"H\u00FCttler\", \"Hiedler\", \"Hittler\" and \"Hitler\". The name was commonly in the German-speaking area of Europe in the 19th century. The literature says that this name is descended from the Czech name \"Hidlar\" or \"Hidlarcek\".\nChildhood and early adulthood.\nAdolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889, as the fourth child of six in Braunau am Inn. This is a small town near Linz in the province of Upper Austria. It is close to the German border, in what was then Austria-Hungary. His parents were Klara P\u00F6lzl and Alois Hitler. Because of his father's job, Hitler moved from Braunau to Passau, later to Lambach and finally to Leonding. He attended several Volksschule's.\nHitler's mother, Klara P\u00F6lzl, was his father's third wife and also his cousin. Hitler's father died in 1903.\nHitler failed high school exams in Linz twice. In 1905, he left school. He became interested in the anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish), Pan-German teachings of Professor Leopold Poetsch. In September 1907, he went to Vienna and took an entrance examination. On 1 and 2 October, he failed the second examination. Hitler went back to Linz at the end of October. In December 1907, Hitler's mother died and, because of that, he was depressed. Hitler's mother was Catholic, but Hitler hated Christianity. He also hated Jews.\nIn 1909, Hitler again went to Vienna to study art. He tried to become a student at the Academy of Arts, but failed the first entrance examination. Hitler said he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna. This town had a large Jewish community.\nIn 1913, Hitler was 24 years old. At that time, all young Austrian men had to join the army. Hitler did not like the Austrian army, so he left Austria for Germany. He lived in the German city of Munich.\nWorld War I.\nOn 16 August 1914, Hitler joined the Bavarian army. He fought for Germany in World War I. Hitler served in Belgium and France in the 16th Bavarian Reserve Regiment. He spent nearly the whole time on the Western Front. He was a runner, one of the most dangerous jobs on the Front. That means he ran from one position to another one to carry messages. On 1 November 1914, Hitler became a Gefreiter (which was like being a private first class in the United States Army, or a lance corporal in the British Army). The government awarded him the Iron Cross Second Class on 2 December 1914.\nOn 5 October 1916, Hitler was hurt by a bullet shell. Between 9 October and 1 December, he was in the military hospital \"Belitz\". In March 1917, he went back to the front. There, he fought in a battle and was awarded with the Milit\u00E4rverdienstkreuz Third Class with swords.\nIn March 1918, Hitler participated in the Spring Offensive. On 4 August 1918, Hitler was awarded with the Iron Cross First Class by the Jewish Hugo Gutmann. After Germany surrendered, Hitler was shocked, because the German army still held enemy area in November 1918.\nEntry into politics.\nAfter World War I, Hitler stayed in the army and returned to Munich. There he attended the funeral march of the Bavarian prime minister Kurt Eisner, who had been killed. In 1919, he participated in a training programme for propaganda speakers from 5 to 12 June and 26 June to 5 July.\nLater that year, Hitler joined a small political party called the German Workers Party. He became member number 555. He soon won the support of the party's members. Two years later, he became the party's leader. He renamed the party the National Socialist German Workers Party. It became known as the Nazi Party.\nDuring the Weimar Republic.\nIn 1923, Hitler got together several hundred other members of the Nazi Party and tried to take over the Weimar Republic government (1918\u201334) in the Beer Hall Putsch. The coup failed. The government killed 13 of his men (the 13 dead men were later declared saints in Nazi ideology). They also put Hitler in the Landsberg Prison. They said that he would stay in prison for five years, but they let him leave after nine months.\n\"Mein Kampf\".\nWhile Hitler was in prison, he wrote a book with the help of his close friend Rudolf Hess. At first, Hitler wanted to call the book \"Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice\". In the end, he called the book \"Mein Kampf\" (\"My Struggle\").\nHitler may also have been influenced by Martin Luther's \"On the Jews and their Lies\". In \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler says Martin Luther was \"a great warrior, a true statesman and a great reformer.\"\nStart of the dictatorship.\nIn 1933, Hitler was elected into the German government. He ended freedom of speech, and put his enemies in jail or killed them. He did not allow any other political party except the Nazi party. Hitler and his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, spread extreme nationalism within Germany. All media had to praise the Nazis. Also, more people were born because Hitler wanted more people of the \"master race\" (those he called \"Aryans\"). He made Germany a totalitarian Nazi state.\nWorld War II and The Holocaust.\nDespite Poland being carved out of former German territory, Hitler is credited with starting World War II by ordering the German Army to invade Poland. His army took over Poland and most of Europe, including France and a large part of the Soviet Union.\nDuring the war, Hitler ordered the Nazis to kill many people, including women and children. The Nazis killed around six million Jews in The Holocaust. Other people that the Nazis killed were Roma (Gypsies), homosexuals, Slavs such as Russians and Poles, and his political opponents.\nFinally, some of the other countries in the world worked together to defeat Germany. Hitler lost all of the land that he had taken. Millions of Germans were killed in the war. At the end of World War II, Hitler gave all people in the \"F\u00FChrerbunker\" the permission to leave it. Many people did and moved to the region of Berchtesgaden. They used planes and truck convoys.\nHitler, the G\u00F6bbels family, Martin Bormann, Eva Braun and some other staff remained in the bunker. Hitler married to Eva Braun on 29 April 1945.\nDeath.\nForty hours after Hitler and Eva Braun got married in Berlin, both of them used poison to kill themselves, then Hitler shot himself in the head with his gun. Before this, Hitler ordered that their bodies be burned. This prevented him from being captured alive by soldiers of the Red Army, who were closing in on him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":87},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_Germany","surface_form":"Chancellor of
