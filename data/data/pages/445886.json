It is a re-release of \"Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey\", but not endorsed by Wayne Gretzky.\nThis game has the license for the 1998 Winter Olympics that were in Nagano, Japan. The game is very similar to \"Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey\". The only real differences are the box art, in-game titles, and some minor graphic changes (such as team logos and colors).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":34},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":58},{"uri":"Wayne_Gretzky%27s_3D_Hockey","surface_form":"Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey","offset":119},{"uri":"Wayne_Gretzky","surface_form":"Wayne Gretzky","offset":167},{"uri":"1998_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"1998 Winter Olympics","offset":216},{"uri":"Nagano%2C_Japan","surface_form":"Nagano, Japan","offset":250},{"uri":"Logo","surface_form":"logo","offset":426}]}
