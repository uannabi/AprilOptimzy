The heir to the throne was usually given the title of Prince of Piedmont.\nThe main residence of the family was the Royal Palace of Turin.\nIt was originally a county but raised to a Duchy in 1416. It greatly increased in size due to the Kingdom of Sardinia being added to the Savoy family possessions. Parts of the Duchy of Milan had also been added before. The small duchy was a neighbour to the Duchy of Parma as well as the larger wealthier Grand Duchy of Tuscany both of which would later form close relationships with eachother often through marriages between princes and princesses.\nIn 1860, under the terms of the Treaty of Turin, the Duchy of Savoy was annexed by France. The last Duke of Savoy, Victor Emmanuel II, became King of Italy and the country was united into modern Italy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":46},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":66},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":253},{"uri":"Prince_of_Piedmont","surface_form":"Prince of Piedmont","offset":314},{"uri":"Royal_Palace_of_Turin","surface_form":"Royal Palace of Turin","offset":375},{"uri":"1416","surface_form":"1416","offset":450},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Sardinia","offset":496},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Parma","surface_form":"Duchy of Parma","offset":656},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Tuscany","offset":703},{"uri":"Duke_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Duke of Savoy","offset":948},{"uri":"Victor_Emmanuel_II","surface_form":"Victor Emmanuel II","offset":963},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1043}]}
