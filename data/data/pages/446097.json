{"id":446097,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapetosaurus","text":"\"Rapetosaurus\" is a genus of sauropod dinosaur. It lived in what is now Madagascar from 70 to 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. Only one species, \"Rapetosaurus krausei\", has been found. Like other sauropods, \"Rapetosaurus\" was a quadrupedal herbivore.\nThe discovery of \"Rapetosaurus\" was the first time a titanosaur had been recovered with an almost perfectly intact skeleton, complete with skull. It has helped to clarify some difficult issues in this large group of sauropod dinosaurs. It provides a baseline for the reconstruction of other titanosaurs that are known only from partial remains.\nBy the early part of the Upper Cretaceous all sauropods, except the titanosaurs, were extinct. The titanosaurs were the dominant herbivores of the Upper Cretaceous on the southern continents which made up Gondwana. Their reign was cut short by the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event.\nJuvenile.\nThe specimen discovered was a juvenile. It is 8 metres (26 ft) from head to tail, and \"probably weighed about as much as an elephant\", according to Kristina Curry Rogers. An adult would have been about twice as long (15 metres (49 ft) in length), which is still less than half the length of its gigantic kin, like \"Argentinosaurus\" and \"Paralititan\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":20},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":29},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":38},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":72},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":134},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":392},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":416},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":827},{"uri":"Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event","surface_form":"Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event","offset":870},{"uri":"Argentinosaurus","surface_form":"Argentinosaurus","offset":1234},{"uri":"Paralititan","surface_form":"Paralititan","offset":1256}]}
