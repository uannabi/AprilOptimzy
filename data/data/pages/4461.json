{"id":4461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"This article is only about the chemistry of the alcohols\".\nIn chemistry, alcohol is a general term which refers to many organic compounds used in industry and science as reagents, solvents, and fuels. Alcohols are carbohydrates which are made of an alkyl group with one or more hydroxyl (-\"OH\") groups bound to its carbon atoms. Alcohol is colorless, and also transparent.\nNames for alcohol.\nThere are two ways of naming alcohols: Common names, and IUPAC names.\nProperties.\nThe hydroxyl (OH) group makes alcohols polar. Alcohols are very weakly acidic. Most alcohols are highly flammable.\nCommon alcohols.\nIUPAC nomenclature is used when describing more complex alcohols.\nIn common usage, \"alcohol\" often means ethanol or \"grain alcohol\".
