It is the main time zone in several countries, including the United Kingdom and Portugal.\nIt is similar to UTC, however, there are some small differences between the two. Including that the Greenwich uses a straight line to signal the Time Zone, while in the UTC people can put which time zone they wants, even if it does not need this time zone. One example is China, which uses one same time zone, meaning that in some places like Beijing 12:00 PM can be 3:00 PM on the western part of the country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":26},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":51},{"uri":"Time_zone","surface_form":"time zone","offset":79},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":100},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":125},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":144},{"uri":"UTC","surface_form":"UTC","offset":171},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":426},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":497}]}
