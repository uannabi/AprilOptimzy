{"id":4464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth","text":"The atmosphere is the layer of gases around the Earth. It is held in place by Earth's gravity. It is made up mainly of nitrogen (78.1%). It also has plentiful oxygen (20.9%) and small amounts of argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (~ 0.035%), water vapor, and other gases. The atmosphere protects life on Earth by absorbing (taking) ultraviolet rays from the sun. It makes our days cooler and our nights warmer.\nSolid particulates, including ash, dust, volcanic ash, etc. are small parts of atmosphere. They are important in making clouds and fog.\nThe atmosphere does not end at a specific place. The higher above the Earth, the thinner the atmosphere. There is no clear border between the atmosphere and outer space, though the K\u00E1rm\u00E1n line is sometimes treated as a border. Even higher, for some purposes the edge of the magnetosphere is treated as a border. 75% of the atmosphere is within of the Earth's surface.\nHistory of Earth's atmosphere.\nOriginally, the Earth's atmosphere had almost no free oxygen.\nTemperature and the atmospheric layers.\nSome parts of the atmosphere are hot or cold, depending on height. Starting from the surface and climbing straight up, the air gets colder in the troposphere, but then it becomes hotter, higher in the stratosphere. These changes of temperature are divided into layers. These are like layers of an onion. The difference between the layers is the way the temperature changes.\nWhere one layer changes to the next have been named \"-pauses.\" So the tropopause is where the troposphere ends (high). The stratopause is at the end of the stratosphere. The mesopause is at the end of the mesosphere.\nThe average temperature of the atmosphere at the surface of Earth is.\nPressure.\nThe atmosphere has pressure. This is because even though air is a gas, it has weight. The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is about.\nDensity and mass.\nThe density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kilograms per cubic meter. This density becomes less at higher altitudes at the same rate that pressure becomes less. The total mass of the atmosphere is about 5.1 \u00D7 1018 kg, which is only a very small part of the Earth's total mass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":31},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":48},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":86},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":119},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":159},{"uri":"Argon","surface_form":"argon","offset":195},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":209},{"uri":"Water_vapor","surface_form":"water vapor","offset":236},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":290},{"uri":"Absorption","surface_form":"absorbing","offset":307},{"uri":"Ultraviolet","surface_form":"ultraviolet","offset":326},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":352},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":370},{"uri":"Night","surface_form":"night","offset":390},{"uri":"Particulate","surface_form":"particulate","offset":411},{"uri":"Ash","surface_form":"ash","offset":435},{"uri":"Dust","surface_form":"dust","offset":440},{"uri":"Volcanic_ash","surface_form":"volcanic ash","offset":446},{"uri":"Cloud","surface_form":"cloud","offset":525},{"uri":"Fog","surface_form":"fog","offset":536},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":664},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":698},{"uri":"K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line","surface_form":"K\u00E1rm\u00E1n line","offset":722},{"uri":"Magnetosphere","surface_form":"magnetosphere","offset":815},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":900},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":994},{"uri":"Height","surface_form":"height","offset":1101},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":1274},{"uri":"Tropopause","surface_form":"tropopause","offset":1486},{"uri":"Stratopause","surface_form":"stratopause","offset":1539},{"uri":"Mesopause","surface_form":"mesopause","offset":1590},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":1732},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":1770},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":1791},{"uri":"Atmospheric_pressure","surface_form":"atmospheric pressure","offset":1811},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1835},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":1877},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1895},{"uri":"Cubic_meter","surface_form":"cubic meter","offset":1932},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":2046}]}
