It is an important left tributary of the Rhine river and the main river of Alsace. It flows through the Haut-Rhin and the Bas-Rhin departments in the Grand Est region.\nGeography.\nThe Ill river has a length of, and a drainage basin with an area of.\nCourse.\nThe Ill starts in the northern side of the Glaserberg mountain, in the Jura Mountains near the Swiss border, in the \"commune\" of Winkel, (Haut-Rhin department), at an altitude of about. From here, the Ill flows first to the east to Ferrette and to Illfurth where it is joined by the \"Largue\" river, the main right tributary of the Ill.\nFrom Illfurth, the Ill runs northward through Alsace, flowing parallel to the Rhine river.\nFive \"communes\" in the Alsace have their names from the river\u02D0\nFinally, the Ill river flows into the Rhine river in the \"commune\" of Offendorf, just to the north of Strasbourg.\nMain tributaries.\nThe main tributaries of the Ill river are all left tributaries; the right tributaries are very short streams. Only the Largue starts in the Jura Mountains; the rest have their sources in the Vosgues mountains, to the east.\nHydrology.\nIts average yearly discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is at Strasbourg in the Bas-Rhin department, for the period 1974 - 2017.\nAverage monthly discharge (m3/s) at Strasbourg (1974 - 2017)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":13},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":22},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":52},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":61},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":93},{"uri":"Rhine_River","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":110},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":144},{"uri":"Haut-Rhin","surface_form":"Haut-Rhin","offset":173},{"uri":"Bas-Rhin","surface_form":"Bas-Rhin","offset":191},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":200},{"uri":"Grand_Est","surface_form":"Grand Est","offset":219},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":229},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":285},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":379},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":420},{"uri":"Communes_in_France","surface_form":"\"commune\"","offset":441},{"uri":"Winkel%2C_Haut-Rhin","surface_form":"Winkel","offset":454},{"uri":"Haut-Rhin","surface_form":"Haut-Rhin","offset":463},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":492},{"uri":"Ferrette","surface_form":"Ferrette","offset":557},{"uri":"Illfurth","surface_form":"Illfurth","offset":573},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":639},{"uri":"Rhine_River","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":853},{"uri":"Offendorf","surface_form":"Offendorf","offset":885},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":917},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":956},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":1048},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"sources","offset":1123},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":1200},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":1211},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1221},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":1275},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":1283},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":1295},{"uri":"Bas-Rhin","surface_form":"Bas-Rhin","offset":1313}]}
