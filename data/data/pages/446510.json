They date from about 13,500 years ago. They are called after the city of Clovis, New Mexico, where examples were first found in 1929.\nTo the right is a typical Clovis point. The length is 4\u201320\u00A0cm/1.5\u20138 inches, width: 2.5\u20135\u00A0cm/1\u20132\u00A0inches. The sides are parallel to convex, and show careful pressure flaking along the blade edge. The back end of the blade and base are shaped for hafting (attaching) to a wooden spear or knife-handle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":37},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":61},{"uri":"Clovis_culture","surface_form":"Clovis culture","offset":76},{"uri":"Clovis%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Clovis, New Mexico","offset":165},{"uri":"Parallel","surface_form":"parallel","offset":344},{"uri":"Convex","surface_form":"convex","offset":356},{"uri":"Hafting","surface_form":"hafting","offset":470},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knife","offset":511}]}
