{"id":446673,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeoclimatology","text":"e=\"preserve\">Palaeoclimatology (or paleoclimatology) is the study of changes in climate over the entire history of Earth. Modern interest in climate change has caused a great increase in the climates of the past.\nThe climates of the past can only be studied by proxy. Data is got from rocks, sediments, ice and tree rings, corals, shells and microfossils. These records are used to work out the past states of the Earth's climate and its atmospheric system.\nStudies of past changes in the life and ecosystems of the past may throw a light on the present. An example is the effect of climate on mass extinctions and the recovery of life after those extinctions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":80},{"uri":"History_of_Earth","surface_form":"history of Earth","offset":104},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":141},{"uri":"Proxy","surface_form":"proxy","offset":261},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"Data","offset":268},{"uri":"Rocks","surface_form":"rocks","offset":285},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":292},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":303},{"uri":"Tree_rings","surface_form":"tree rings","offset":311},{"uri":"Coral","surface_form":"coral","offset":323},{"uri":"Shell_(zoology)","surface_form":"shells","offset":331},{"uri":"Microfossil","surface_form":"microfossil","offset":342},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":414},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmospheric","offset":438},{"uri":"Ecosystems","surface_form":"ecosystems","offset":498},{"uri":"Mass_extinction","surface_form":"mass extinction","offset":594}]}
