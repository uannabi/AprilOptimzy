{"id":446774,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_conservatism","text":"=\"preserve\">Liberal conservatism is a political ideology that combines elements of conservatism and economic liberalism. Liberal conservatives believe in the free market and laissez-faire economic policies combined with traditional conservative values, such as the belief in natural inequality, the importance of religion, and the value of traditional morality. In a way, liberal conservatism is the opposite of classical liberalism, a belief that supports both economic and individual freedom.\nThis term should not be confused for conservative liberalism, which is an offshoot of liberalism, not conservatism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservatism","offset":83},{"uri":"Economic_liberalism","surface_form":"economic liberalism","offset":100},{"uri":"Free_market","surface_form":"free market","offset":158},{"uri":"Laissez-faire","surface_form":"laissez-faire","offset":174},{"uri":"Classical_liberalism","surface_form":"classical liberalism","offset":412},{"uri":"Conservative_liberalism","surface_form":"conservative liberalism","offset":532}]}
