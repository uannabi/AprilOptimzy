A\u00A0Dutch programmer\u00A0named Guido van Rossum made\u00A0Python\u00A0in 1991. He named it after the television show Monty Python's Flying Circus. Many Python examples and tutorials include jokes from the show.\nPython is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run. A program called an interpreter runs Python code on\u00A0almost any kind of computer.\u00A0This means that a programmer can change the code and quickly see the results. This also means Python is slower than a compiled language like C, because it is not running machine code directly.\nPython is a good programming language for beginners. It is a high-level language, which means a programmer can focus on what to do instead of how to do it. Writing programs in Python takes less time than in some other languages.\nPython drew inspiration from\u00A0other programming languages\u00A0like C, C++, Java, Perl, and Lisp.\nPython's developers try to avoid changing the language to make it better until they have a lot of things to change. Also, they try not to make small repairs, called patches, to unimportant parts of the CPython reference implementation that would make it faster. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move some of the work of the program to other parts written in programming languages like C or PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. It translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\nKeeping Python fun to use is an important goal of Python\u2019s developers. It reflects in the language's name, a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python. On occasions, they are playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as referring to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.\nPython use.\nPython is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers and is used in many places. Sometimes only Python code is used for a program, but most of the time it is used to do simple jobs while another programming language is used to do more complicated tasks.\nIts standard library is made up of many functions that come with Python when it is installed. On the Internet there are many other libraries available that make it possible for the Python language to do more things. These libraries make it a powerful language; it can do many different things.\nSyntax.\nPython has a very easy-to-read syntax. Some of Python's syntax comes from C, because that is the language that Python was written in. But Python uses whitespace to delimit code: spaces or tabs are used to organize code into groups. This is different from C. In C, there is a semicolon at the end of each line and curly braces () are used to group code. Using whitespace to delimit code makes Python a very easy-to-read language.\nExpressions.\nPython's expressions include some that are similar to other programming languages and others that are not.\nExample.\nThis is a small example of a Python program. It shows \"Hello World!\" on the screen.\nPython also does something called \"dynamic variable assignment\". This means that when a number or word is made in a program, the user does not have to say what type it is. This makes it easier to reuse variable names, making fast changes simpler. An example of this is shown below. This code will make both a number and a word, and show them both, using only one variable.\nIn a \"statically typed\" language like C, a programmer would have to say whether codice_2 was a number or a word before C would let the programmer set up codice_2, and after that, C would not allow its type to change from a number to a word.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["programming language"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Open_source","surface_form":"open source","offset":13},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":25},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":95},{"uri":"Guido_van_Rossum","surface_form":"Guido van Rossum","offset":118},{"uri":"Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus","surface_form":"Monty Python's Flying Circus","offset":194},{"uri":"Interpreted_language","surface_form":"an interpreted language","offset":298},{"uri":"Compiled_language","surface_form":"compiled","offset":363},{"uri":"Interpreter_(computing)","surface_form":"interpreter","offset":400},{"uri":"C_(programming_language)","surface_form":"C","offset":602},{"uri":"Machine_code","surface_form":"machine code","offset":631},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":948},{"uri":"Java_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Java","offset":953},{"uri":"Perl","surface_form":"Perl","offset":959},{"uri":"LISP","surface_form":"Lisp","offset":969},{"uri":"Standard_library","surface_form":"standard library","offset":2096},{"uri":"Computable_function","surface_form":"functions","offset":2132},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":2193},{"uri":"Library_(computing)","surface_form":"libraries","offset":2223},{"uri":"Semicolon","surface_form":"semicolon","offset":2669},{"uri":"Hello_World","surface_form":"Hello World","offset":3007}]}
