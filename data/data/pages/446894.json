The character was also designed to be easily drawable by children.\nFeatures.\nEggman is a distinguished scientist and mechanical genius with an IQ of 300. He is an expert in the field of robotics. Despite all this, Eggman uses intelligence on purposes. He attempts to conquer the world and create his own utopia.

Despite his intellect, Eggman is often very childish. He sometimes behaves like a baby when he is in trouble.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Antagonist","surface_form":"antagonist","offset":51},{"uri":"Sonic_the_Hedgehog","surface_form":"Sonic the Hedgehog","offset":65},{"uri":"Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)","surface_form":"Sonic the Hedgehog","offset":124},{"uri":"Sega_Mega_Drive","surface_form":"Sega Mega Drive","offset":148},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":252},{"uri":"Caricature","surface_form":"caricature","offset":285},{"uri":"Theodore_Roosevelt","surface_form":"Theodore Roosevelt","offset":299},{"uri":"Robot","surface_form":"robot","offset":674},{"uri":"Utopia","surface_form":"utopia","offset":792}]}
