It was relaunched in May 1997 under the name Headline Sports with channel licencing Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.\nThe licence was rewritten by the CRTC to allow live sports programming and because of this, as well as legal issues with U.S. cable news channel CNN Headline News which also had a \"Headline Sports\" segment, the channel became known as The Score Television Network.\nOn October 19, 2012, they were acquired by Rogers Media for $167 million. On July 1, 2013, Rogers renamed the channel Sportsnet 360.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":19},{"uri":"Cable_television","surface_form":"cable","offset":45},{"uri":"Satellite_television","surface_form":"satellite television","offset":55},{"uri":"Specialty_channel","surface_form":"specialty channel","offset":76},{"uri":"Rogers_Media","surface_form":"Rogers Media","offset":121},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":228},{"uri":"College_athletics","surface_form":"university sports","offset":240},{"uri":"Mixed_martial_arts","surface_form":"mixed martial arts","offset":259},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":279},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer","offset":307},{"uri":"Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission","surface_form":"Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission","offset":467},{"uri":"HLN_(TV_channel)","surface_form":"CNN Headline News","offset":673},{"uri":"Rogers_Media","surface_form":"Rogers Media","offset":836}]}
