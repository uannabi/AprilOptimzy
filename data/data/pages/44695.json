By \"will\" he means a wanting and craving like that which we know in ourselves as our \"will.\" It is the source of immense amounts of suffering in the world. He also believed that a \"better consciousness\" could be attained by denying the fulfilment of our desires, taking time to think about who we really are and what we should do to avoid suffering - but also, in doing something few philosophers of his day spoke of: in making and looking at works of art, especially music, which he considered a way to escape from the world's pain and suffering.\nSchopenhauer was a huge influence on Richard Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud, Leo Tolstoy, Carl Jung, Emil Cioran and many other important artists and thinkers of the 20th Century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"February_22","surface_form":"February 22","offset":21},{"uri":"1788","surface_form":"1788","offset":34},{"uri":"Danzig","surface_form":"Danzig","offset":42},{"uri":"September_21","surface_form":"September 21","offset":51},{"uri":"1860","surface_form":"1860","offset":65},{"uri":"Frankfurt_am_Main","surface_form":"Frankfurt am Main","offset":73},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":98},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":105},{"uri":"Kant","surface_form":"Kant","offset":139},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":145},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":185},{"uri":"Upanishads","surface_form":"Upanishads","offset":202},{"uri":"Pessimism","surface_form":"immense amounts of suffering in the world","offset":488},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":960},{"uri":"Friedrich_Nietzsche","surface_form":"Friedrich Nietzsche","offset":976},{"uri":"Ludwig_Wittgenstein","surface_form":"Ludwig Wittgenstein","offset":997},{"uri":"Thomas_Mann","surface_form":"Thomas Mann","offset":1018},{"uri":"Sigmund_Freud","surface_form":"Sigmund Freud","offset":1031},{"uri":"Leo_Tolstoy","surface_form":"Leo Tolstoy","offset":1046},{"uri":"Carl_Jung","surface_form":"Carl Jung","offset":1059},{"uri":"Emil_Cioran","surface_form":"Emil Cioran","offset":1070}]}
