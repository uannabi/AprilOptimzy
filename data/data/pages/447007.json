{"id":447007,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(movie)","text":"\"Memento\" is a 2000 American mystery-thriller movie written and directed by Christopher Nolan, and produced by Suzanne and Jennifer Todd. The movie's script was based on a pitch by Jonathan Nolan, who wrote the 2001 story \"Memento Mori\" from the concept. Guy Pearce stars as a man who, as a result of an injury, has anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and has short-term memory loss approximately every fifteen minutes. He is searching for the people who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember.\nThe movie is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the movie: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the movie, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.\n\"Memento\" premiered at the 57th Venice International Film Festival on September 5, 2000, and was released in the United States on March 16, 2001. It was acclaimed by critics, who praised its nonlinear narrative structure and motifs of memory, perception, grief, and self-deception, and earned $39.9 million over a $4.5 million budget. \"Memento\" received numerous accolades, including Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. The movie is now widely regarded as one of Nolan's finest works and one of the best movies of the 2000s. In 2017, the United States Library of Congress deemed the movie and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":20},{"uri":"Mystery_movie","surface_form":"mystery","offset":29},{"uri":"Thriller_movie","surface_form":"thriller movie","offset":37},{"uri":"Christopher_Nolan","surface_form":"Christopher Nolan","offset":76},{"uri":"Suzanne_Todd","surface_form":"Suzanne","offset":111},{"uri":"Jennifer_Todd","surface_form":"Jennifer Todd","offset":123},{"uri":"Pitch","surface_form":"pitch","offset":172},{"uri":"Jonathan_Nolan","surface_form":"Jonathan Nolan","offset":181},{"uri":"Memento_Mori","surface_form":"Memento Mori","offset":223},{"uri":"Guy_Pearce","surface_form":"Guy Pearce","offset":255},{"uri":"Anterograde_amnesia","surface_form":"anterograde amnesia","offset":316},{"uri":"Polaroid","surface_form":"Polaroid","offset":539},{"uri":"Black-and-white","surface_form":"black-and-white","offset":716},{"uri":"57th_Venice_International_Film_Festival","surface_form":"57th Venice International Film Festival","offset":1007},{"uri":"Nonlinear_narrative","surface_form":"nonlinear narrative","offset":1171},{"uri":"Motifs","surface_form":"motifs","offset":1205},{"uri":"Oscar","surface_form":"Oscar","offset":1364},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay","surface_form":"Best Original Screenplay","offset":1386},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Film_Editing","surface_form":"Best Film Editing","offset":1415},{"uri":"Library_of_Congress","surface_form":"Library of Congress","offset":1566},{"uri":"National_Film_Registry","surface_form":"National Film Registry","offset":1643}]}
