{"id":447031,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Gary_Powers","text":"Francis Gary Powers (Jenkins, Kentucky August 17, 1929\u00A0\u2013 Los Angeles, California, August 1, 1977) was an American pilot. He was known for piloting a Central Intelligence Agency U-2 spy plane which was shot down while flying a reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union. This caused the 1960 U-2 incident, and played a large role in the Cold War.\nPowers was held as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. On February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged in a spy swap in Berlin. The exchange was for Soviet KGB Colonel Vilyam Fisher, known as \"Rudolf Abel\", who had been caught by the FBI and tried and jailed for espionage. Powers credited his father with the swap idea. When released, Powers's total time in captivity was 1 year, 9 months, and 10 days.\nPowers died in Los Angeles County, California in a helicopter crash, aged 47.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jenkins%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Jenkins, Kentucky","offset":21},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles, California","offset":57},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":105},{"uri":"Aviator","surface_form":"pilot","offset":114},{"uri":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","surface_form":"Central Intelligence Agency","offset":149},{"uri":"Lockheed_U-2","surface_form":"U-2 spy plane","offset":177},{"uri":"Reconnaissance","surface_form":"reconnaissance","offset":226},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":258},{"uri":"1960_U-2_incident","surface_form":"1960 U-2 incident","offset":288},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":338},{"uri":"Prisoner_of_war","surface_form":"prisoner of war","offset":369},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":466},{"uri":"Colonel","surface_form":"Colonel","offset":506},{"uri":"Rudolf_Abel","surface_form":"Vilyam Fisher","offset":514},{"uri":"FBI","surface_form":"FBI","offset":580},{"uri":"Espionage","surface_form":"espionage","offset":609},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_County","surface_form":"Los Angeles County","offset":765},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":785},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":801}]}
