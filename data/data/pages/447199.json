{"id":447199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_%C3%9Cber_Alles","text":"\"California \u00DCber Alles\" is the first single off American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys' debut studio album \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\". The song was released in June 1979.\nThe lyrics for the song were written by lead singer Jello Biafra and John Greenway for their band, The Healers. Biafra composed the music during one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.\nThe song is about Jerry Brown, the Governor of California from 1975-1983 (and later 2011\u2013present). It is sung from his perspective, as a fictional version of Brown shapes a hippie-fascist vision for America. The title is a reference to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany, which began with the words \"Deutschland, Deutschland \u00FCber alles\" (literally: \"Germany, Germany above all\").\nThe song appeared in the video games Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and the Rock Band series.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Single"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":48},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":57},{"uri":"Dead_Kennedys","surface_form":"Dead Kennedys","offset":76},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":97},{"uri":"Fresh_Fruit_for_Rotting_Vegetables","surface_form":"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables","offset":111},{"uri":"Jello_Biafra","surface_form":"Jello Biafra","offset":236},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass","offset":370},{"uri":"Jerry_Brown","surface_form":"Jerry Brown","offset":394},{"uri":"Governor_of_California","surface_form":"Governor of California","offset":411},{"uri":"Hippie","surface_form":"hippie","offset":549},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"fascist","offset":556},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":575},{"uri":"Stanza","surface_form":"stanza","offset":643},{"uri":"Das_Lied_der_Deutschen","surface_form":"national anthem of Germany","offset":657},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":818},{"uri":"Tony_Hawk%27s_American_Wasteland","surface_form":"Tony Hawk's American Wasteland","offset":830},{"uri":"Rock_Band_(video_game)","surface_form":"Rock Band series","offset":869}]}
