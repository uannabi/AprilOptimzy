{"id":447433,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buitreraptor","text":"\"Buitreraptor\" is a small dromaeosaur from the Cretaceous of Argentina. It was about four to five feet long (1.5 metres).\n\"Buitreraptor\" has a slender, flat, extremely elongated snout. Its jaws have many small teeth which lack meat-tearing serrations or cutting edges. They are grooved, strongly recurved and flattened. This probably meant it ate quite small animals, like lizards and mammals.\nSince its close relatives had feathers, it is likely that \"Buitreraptor\" also was feathered.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dromaeosaur","surface_form":"dromaeosaur","offset":26},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":47},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":61},{"uri":"Lizards","surface_form":"lizards","offset":373},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":385},{"uri":"Feathers","surface_form":"feathers","offset":424}]}
