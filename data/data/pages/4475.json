{"id":4475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread","text":"Bread is a type of baked food. It is mainly made from dough, which is made mainly from flour and water. Usually, salt and yeast are added. Bread is often baked in an oven. It can be bought all over the world.\nBread can be toasted or used to make sandwiches. Pizza is a food based on bread. There are many different kinds of bread.\nThe color and taste of the bread depend on the kind of flour used and the style of baking. Flour made from the whole grain gives darker bread. Flour made just from the polished wheat grain gives a very white bread. Rye and barley flour give darker types of bread. The type of flour also changes how long the bread can be kept before going bad. Some strains of wheat are resistant to fungus, but may not produce a bread as tasty as a weaker strain.\nReligious breads.\nChristianity and Judaism have rules about the use of bread in their religions. Unleavened bread (matzo) is eaten by Jews during the Passover. The Catholic celebration of the Eucharist uses unleavened wafers.\nOrthodox churches forbid the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist (Old Testament) and permit leavened bread only as a symbol of the New. This was one of the three points of contention that brought about the schism between Eastern and Western churches in 1054.\nTypes of bread.\nBread is an important part of life in many countries, because so many people eat it. In many cultures, bread is so important that it is part of religious rituals.\nCake is made in a similar way to bread but sugar, fat and milk are added to the dough and often more ingredients.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baking","surface_form":"baked","offset":19},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":25},{"uri":"Dough","surface_form":"dough","offset":54},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":87},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":97},{"uri":"Sodium_chloride","surface_form":"salt","offset":113},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":122},{"uri":"Oven","surface_form":"oven","offset":166},{"uri":"Toast","surface_form":"toast","offset":222},{"uri":"Sandwich","surface_form":"sandwich","offset":246},{"uri":"Pizza","surface_form":"Pizza","offset":258},{"uri":"Strain","surface_form":"strain","offset":680},{"uri":"Resistant","surface_form":"resistant","offset":701},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungus","offset":714},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":797},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":814},{"uri":"Matzo","surface_form":"matzo","offset":894},{"uri":"Passover","surface_form":"Passover","offset":929},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":943},{"uri":"Eucharist","surface_form":"Eucharist","offset":971},{"uri":"Eastern_Christianity","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":1005},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":1077},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New","offset":1142},{"uri":"East-West_Schism","surface_form":"schism","offset":1217},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern","offset":1232},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Western","offset":1244},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":1329},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1379},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":1430},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":1440},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"Cake","offset":1449}]}
