{"id":44760,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Amnesia is a what doctors call a loss or disturbance of memory. It is a loss of memory, that is to say, a person cannot remember certain things. Amnesia can be caused when someone has brain damage, a disease or when something really stressful happens.\nThe fact that adults usually cannot remember events that occurred in early childhood is called \"infantile amnesia\". It is attributed to the development of the brain or that of the child. It is not seen as a form of amnesia comparable to the other types.\nCauses.\nThere are three main categories in which amnesia can happen to a person.\nAmnesia can be permanent, or it can be temporary. Damage to the [brain], or the use of certain [drug]s can cause amnesia. Some of these drugs are [sedative]s. Another well known cause for amnesia can be drinking too much [alcohol]. Those kinds of causes are called \"organic\", because they can been directly seen. Other causes cannot directly be seen, they are called \"functional\". Rather they are [psychology|psychological] in their nature. People may want to shield off a traumatic event they witnessed, for example.\nAnother minor cause of amnesia is \"heartbreak\" in a relationship. It can lead to trauma, but it is not necessarily traumatic.\nTreatment.\nSometimes certain types of amnesia fix themselves without being treated. There are also different types of therapy that work with the brain to help with amnesia. There is no medicine that can directly help with amnesia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":69},{"uri":"Brain_damage","surface_form":"brain damage","offset":197},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":213},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":1389}]}
