{"id":447617,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilmer_of_Malmesbury","text":"Eilmer of Malmesbury was an English monk, born around 980. He is known for having attempted one of the first human flights in history.\nThe reason Eilmer made his flight was that he needed to think of a way out whenever the Vikings would attack the abbey. He went up a church tower with his gliding equipment that he had made from willow or ash. He made a downward flight of some 200 meters or so - from at least 18 meters high.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":36},{"uri":"Vikings","surface_form":"Vikings","offset":223}]}
