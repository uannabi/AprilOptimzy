{"id":447652,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion","text":"The Bay of Pigs Invasion was an attempt in 1961 (during the Cold War) to remove Fidel Castro from power in Cuba. The CIA trained Cuban exiles and these exiles launched an attack in a bay called the Bay of Pigs.\nThe invasion was a failure and most of the attackers were captured or killed. There were several conflicts that led to this; including a lack of promised air support and a change in where the landing was to be launched. This was one of many unsuccessful attempts by the CIA to rid Cuba of Castro. One interesting fact is that the plan was originally put in motion by Eisenhower, but the attack was ordered by John F. Kennedy who only found out about the plan after his election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1961","surface_form":"1961","offset":43},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":60},{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":80},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":107},{"uri":"CIA","surface_form":"CIA","offset":117},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":135},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":215},{"uri":"Failure","surface_form":"failure","offset":230},{"uri":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","surface_form":"CIA","offset":481},{"uri":"Eisenhower","surface_form":"Eisenhower","offset":578},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
