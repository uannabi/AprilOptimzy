{"id":44783,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)","text":"Parallel is a term in geometry and in everyday life that refers to a property of lines or planes. Parallel lines or planes are next to each other, but never touch each other. This means they never intersect at any point. If two lines formula_1 and formula_1 are parallel, then we describe this by writing formula_1. The slopes of parallel lines are always equal.\nEven if these two line segments were extended to infinity, there would never be a point of intersection between the two of them. In fact, two parallel lines in the two-dimensional plane are always a fixed distance apart.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":22},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":81},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"planes","offset":90},{"uri":"Touch","surface_form":"touch","offset":157},{"uri":"Intersect","surface_form":"intersect","offset":197},{"uri":"Point_(geometry)","surface_form":"point","offset":214}]}
