The last time it erupted was from 1707 to 1708.\nActive volcano.\nMount Fuji is officially classified as an active volcano, but some describe Fuji as dormant or inactive.\nThe last major event was the H\u014Dei eruption of Mount Fuji which started on December 16, 1707 (\"H\u014Dei 4, 23rd day of the 11th month\") and ended about January 1, 1708 (\"H\u014Dei 4, 9th day of the 12th month\") during the Edo period. Cinders and ash from Fuji fell like rain in Izu Province, Kai Province, Sagami Province, and Musashi Province.\nShinto.\nThe mountain is thought to be named after Fuchi, the Buddhist fire goddess.
