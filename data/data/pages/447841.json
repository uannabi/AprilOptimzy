The person ropes the calf, then jumps off their horse and ties the calf's one front foot and two hind feet with a \"piggin' rope\". Then they must give the calf some slack and the rope must stay tied for 6 seconds.\nCalf roping started with cowboys. They had to rope and tie down calves to brand them and doctor them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":17},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"calf","offset":47},{"uri":"Cowboy","surface_form":"cowboy","offset":304},{"uri":"Livestock_branding","surface_form":"brand","offset":353}]}
