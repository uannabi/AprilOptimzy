They competed at the British Commonwealth Games in London, England.\nStarting in 1937, she wrote \u201CSports Reel\u201D, a newspaper column in the \"Globe and Mail,\" a Canadian newspaper\".\" Through her writing, she continued to remind women that they were \u201Cpeople\u201D and they could do anything they wanted, including sports.\nDeath and legacy.\nRosenfeld died on November 13, 1969.
