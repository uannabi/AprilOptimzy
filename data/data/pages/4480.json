{"id":4480,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto","text":"Shinto () is a form of Japanese animism. It has many \"kami\", translated as gods or nature spirits. Some \"kami\" are just spirits of certain places, and some are the overall \"kami\" (like \"Amaterasu\", the Sun goddess). The word \"Shinto\" comes from the Japanese words \", \"shin\"\u2014the word for spirit or god, and \", \"t\u014D\"\u2014the word for \"the way\" or \"path\". So, Shinto means \"the way of the gods.\"\nState Shinto was the main religion of Japan before World War II. During the period 1868 to 1945 the Japanese government used Shinto for propaganda. All Japanese were forced to register with their local shrine. All Shinto priests worked for the government. War was seen as a sacred duty. The Emperor of Japan was seen as a god. Japanese Buddhism was also involved with the war effort (See Zen at War).\nShinto has many rituals and customs, and some are done every day. Festivals are frequent. Some people mix Shinto and Buddhist rituals and beliefs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":23},{"uri":"Animism","surface_form":"animism","offset":32},{"uri":"Kami","surface_form":"kami","offset":54},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":75},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":90},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":202},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":287},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"god","offset":297},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":439},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":524},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"War","offset":644},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"Emperor of Japan","offset":679},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":724},{"uri":"Zen_at_War","surface_form":"Zen at War","offset":776},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":805},{"uri":"Custom","surface_form":"custom","offset":817}]}
