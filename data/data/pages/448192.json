In the\n1950s it was replaced with the AK-47. The SKS remained in second-line service for decades. It is still used as a ceremonial arm today. The SKS is currently popular in the civilian surplus market in many countries. This includes the United States, Canada and New Zealand. It was one of the first weapons designed to use the M-43 7.62\u00D739mm round, which was also used later in the AK-47.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":9},{"uri":"Semi-automatic_firearm","surface_form":"semi-automatic","offset":27},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":42},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":56},{"uri":"Sergei_Gavrilovich_Simonov","surface_form":"Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov","offset":76},{"uri":"AK-47","surface_form":"AK-47","offset":142},{"uri":"Ceremonial_weapon","surface_form":"ceremonial arm","offset":224},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":282},{"uri":"Military_surplus","surface_form":"surplus","offset":291},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":343},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":358},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":369},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":406},{"uri":"7.62%C3%9739mm","surface_form":"7.62\u00D739mm","offset":439},{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"round","offset":449}]}
