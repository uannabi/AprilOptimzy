{"id":4483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano","text":"A volcano is a mountain that has\u00A0lava (hot, liquid rock) coming out from a magma chamber under the ground, or did have in the past. Volcanoes are formed by the movement of tectonic plates.\nThe Earth's crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates. These float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Volcanoes are often found where tectonic plates are moving apart or coming together.\nVolcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift. Volcanoes are usually not found where two tectonic plates slide past one another.\nVolcanism away from plate boundaries is caused by mantle plumes. These so-called \"hotspots\", for example Hawaii, are thought to arise from upwelling magma from the core\u2013mantle boundary, 3,000\u00A0km deep in the Earth.\nMost volcanoes have a volcanic crater at the top. When a volcano is active, materials come out of it. The materials include lava, steam, gaseous sulfur compounds, ash and broken rock pieces.\nWhen there is enough pressure, the volcano erupts. Some volcanic eruptions blow off the top of the volcano. Sometimes, the magma comes out quickly and sometimes it comes slowly. Some eruptions come out at a side instead of the top.\nVolcanoes are found on planets other than Earth. An example is Olympus Mons on Mars.\nVolcanologists are scientists who study volcanoes using methods from geology, chemistry, geography, mineralogy, physics and sociology.\nThe world's biggest volcano is named Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Mauna Loa is part of the five volcanoes on Hawaii's 'Big Island'. The most recent time this volcano erupted was in 1984. It erupted 33 times in the last 170 years. Like all the other Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa was created by the movement of the Pacific tectonic plate which moved over the Hawaii hotspot in the Earth's mantle. Mauna Loa is 4,196\u00A0meters tall. It is a shield volcano. The largest recent eruption from Mauna Loa left a lava trail long.\nTypes of volcanoes.\nThe lava and pyroclastic material (clouds of ash, lava fragments and vapor) that comes out from volcanoes can make many different kinds of land shapes. There are two basic kinds of volcanoes.\nShield volcanoes.\nThese volcanoes are formed by fluid low-silica mafic lava.\nShield volcanoes are built out of layers of lava from continual eruptions (without explosions). Because the lava is so fluid, it spreads out, often over a wide area. Shield volcanoes do not grow to a great height, and the layers of lava spread out to give the volcano gently sloping sides. Shield volcanoes can produce huge areas of basalt, which is usually what lava is when cooled.\nThe base of the volcano increases in size over successive eruptions where solidified lava spreads out and accumulates. Some of the world's largest volcanoes are shield volcanoes.\nEven though their sides are not very \"steep\", shield volcanoes can be huge. Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the biggest mountain on Earth if it is measured from its base on the floor of the sea.\nStratovolcanoes.\nA stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a tall, conical volcano. It is built up of many layers of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash.\nUnlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes have a steep profile and periodic eruptions. The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far. It is sticky, that is, it has high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, with high-to-intermediate levels of silica, and less mafic magma. Big felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as.\nTwo famous stratovolcanoes are Japan's Mount Fuji, and Vesuvius. Both have big bases and steep sides that get steeper and steeper as it goes near the top. Vesuvius is famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79\u00A0AD, killing thousands.\nCaldera.\nA caldera is a basin-like feature formed by collapse of land after a volcanic eruption. This happens after a huge stratovolcano blows its top off. The base of the crater then sinks, leaving a caldera where the top of the volcano was before. Krakatoa, best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883, is much smaller now.\nHow volcanoes are formed.\nVolcanoes are made when two tectonic plates come together. When these two plates meet, one of them (usually the oceanic plate) goes under the continental plate. This is the process of subduction. Afterwards, it melts and makes magma (inside the magma chamber), and the pressure builds up until the magma bursts through the Earth's crust.\nThe second way is when a tectonic plate moves over a hot spot in the Earth's crust. The hot spot works its way through the crust until it breaks through. The caldera of Yellowstone Park was formed in that way; so were the Hawaiian Islands.\nClassification.\nA traditional way to classify or identify volcanoes is by its pattern of eruptions. Those volcanoes which may erupt again at any time are called active. Those that are now quiet called dormant (inactive). Those volcanoes which have not erupted in historical times are called extinct.\nActive.\nAn active volcano is currently erupting, or it has erupted in the last 10,000 years. An example of an active volcano is Mount St. Helens in the United States (US).\nDormant(inactive).\nA dormant volcano is \"sleeping,\" but it could awaken in the future. Mount Rainier in the United States is considered dormant.\nin French dormant means en sommeil\nExtinct (dead volcano).\nAn extinct volcano has not erupted in the past 10,000 years. Edinburgh Castle in Scotland is located on top of an extinct volcano.\nLargest volcano on Earth.\nThe Earth's largest volcano has been discovered. It is 2\u00A0km below the sea on an underwater plateau known as the Shatsky Rise. This is about 1,600\u00A0km east of Japan. The previous record-holder, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, is still the largest volcano on land.\nThe 310,000\u00A0km2 (119,000\u00A0sq mi) volcano, Tamu Massif, is comparable in size to Mars' vast Olympus Mons volcano, which is the largest in the Solar System. It was formed about 145 million years ago when massive lava flows erupted from the centre of the volcano to form a broad, shield-like feature. That suggests the volcano produced a flood basalt eruption.\nThe Tamu Massif extends some 30\u00A0km (18\u00A0miles) into the Earth's crust. The researchers doubted the submerged volcano's peak ever rose above sea level during its lifetime and say it is unlikely to erupt again.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":33},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":75},{"uri":"Tectonic_plates","surface_form":"tectonic
