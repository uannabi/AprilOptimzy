When full water from Lake Albacutya flows along Outlet Creek, and begins to fill further small lakes and wetlands to the north. This has not happened since 1976.\nBecause the lake has less salt than Lake Hindmarsh, Lake Albacutya supports a denser cover of vegetation in its dry phase.\nThe lake has not received any inflow for some years and remained dry throughout the wetter years of 2011-2012.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Victoria%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":47},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":57},{"uri":"Ramsar_Convention","surface_form":"Ramsar Convention","offset":132},{"uri":"Gigalitre","surface_form":"GL","offset":213},{"uri":"Wimmera_River","surface_form":"Wimmera River","offset":241},{"uri":"Lake_Hindmarsh","surface_form":"Lake Hindmarsh","offset":336},{"uri":"Lake_Hindmarsh","surface_form":"Lake Hindmarsh","offset":616}]}
