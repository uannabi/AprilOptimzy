It had a wide distribution in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. They lived from the Eocene epoch to the Pleistocene epoch 46.2 1.8 million years ago (mya), for a total of about 44.4 million years.\nOriginally they evolved in the Old World, but crossed over to the Americas during the Miocene epoch. This would happen at a time when crossing was possible via the Bering Strait.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":46},{"uri":"Terrestrial_animal","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":62},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":74},{"uri":"Suborder","surface_form":"suborder","offset":116},{"uri":"Caniformia","surface_form":"Caniformia","offset":125},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":167},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":182},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":190},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":200},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":228},{"uri":"Epoch_(geology)","surface_form":"epoch","offset":235},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":248},{"uri":"Old_World","surface_form":"Old World","offset":372},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":427},{"uri":"Bering_Strait","surface_form":"Bering Strait","offset":505}]}
