It was named in honor of the German field marshal and statesman Paul von Hindenburg. Such airships are called Zeppelin. Along with another Zeppelin, LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin, it was the biggest airship in the world at the time it was built.\nThe Zeppelin gained lots of publicity and became very famous. The boxer Max Schmeling flew on it back to Germany after defeating Joe Louis in the United States. It was also present during the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer Olympics which were held in Berlin. This attention was part of the Zeppelin company's plan to offer a fleet of their airships for trans-atlantic service.\nThe disaster.\nOn May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was landing in New Jersey after a transatlantic flight, when it burst into flames. 36 people died and many were injured. The Hindenburg was destroyed by the burning of the hydrogen that was inside it. There are many opinions on what started the fire.\nAn announcer, Herbert Morrison reported the landing and then screamed and said, \"Oh the humanity\" after it caught on fire. Morrison's line is now famous around the world as well as photos and film footage of the disaster.\nThe rock group Led Zeppelin used a picture of the fire for the cover of their self-titled debut album.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":34},{"uri":"Airship","surface_form":"airship","offset":41},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":94},{"uri":"Generalfeldmarschall","surface_form":"field marshal","offset":101},{"uri":"Statesman","surface_form":"statesman","offset":119},{"uri":"Paul_von_Hindenburg","surface_form":"Paul von Hindenburg","offset":129},{"uri":"Zeppelin","surface_form":"Zeppelin","offset":175},{"uri":"LZ_130_Graf_Zeppelin","surface_form":"LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin","offset":214},{"uri":"Max_Schmeling","surface_form":"Max Schmeling","offset":374},{"uri":"Joe_Louis","surface_form":"Joe Louis","offset":431},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":448},{"uri":"1936_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1936 Summer Olympics","offset":518},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":558},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":744},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":901},{"uri":"Led_Zeppelin","surface_form":"Led Zeppelin","offset":1217},{"uri":"Led_Zeppelin_(album)","surface_form":"self-titled debut album","offset":1280}]}
