{"id":448470,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbleball_Lake","text":"Wimbleball Lake is in Exmoor National Park in Somerset, England. It is used as a water supply reservoir, built in the 1970s and completed in 1979.\nWimbleball Lake was nominated to be the first Dark Skies Discovery Site on Exmoor. Exmoor National Park has been designated an International Dark Sky Reserve, the first place in Europe to achieve this award and only the second in the world.\nThe high dam is a concrete buttress which holds back the River Haddeo. It has a water storage capacity of 21,000 megalitres over.\nAt times of low flow in the River Exe, water is released into the river for taking out downstream at Tiverton and Exeter. The effects of this regulation of the water flow from the lake have been studied.\nThe area near the lake is a recreation and sports area. The Outdoor + Active Centre is open for tuition in various watersports activities including sailing, windsurfing, canoeing and rowing. Visitors can also launch their own craft or hire from the centre. The cycle route takes you around the lake, following mostly bridleways and some quiet country lanes. The route passes through woodland and grassland, with glimpses of the lake.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Exmoor","surface_form":"Exmoor","offset":22},{"uri":"National_Park","surface_form":"National Park","offset":29},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":46},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":94},{"uri":"Dark_Skies_Discovery_Site","surface_form":"Dark Skies Discovery Site","offset":193},{"uri":"Exmoor_National_Park","surface_form":"Exmoor National Park","offset":230},{"uri":"International_Dark_Sky_Reserve","surface_form":"International Dark Sky Reserve","offset":274},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":397},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":406},{"uri":"Buttress","surface_form":"buttress","offset":415},{"uri":"River_Haddeo","surface_form":"River Haddeo","offset":445},{"uri":"River_Exe","surface_form":"River Exe","offset":546},{"uri":"Tiverton%2C_Devon","surface_form":"Tiverton","offset":619},{"uri":"Exeter","surface_form":"Exeter","offset":632},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":750},{"uri":"Watersport","surface_form":"watersport","offset":837},{"uri":"Sailing","surface_form":"sailing","offset":870},{"uri":"Windsurfing","surface_form":"windsurfing","offset":879},{"uri":"Canoeing","surface_form":"canoeing","offset":892},{"uri":"Rowing","surface_form":"rowing","offset":905},{"uri":"Cycle","surface_form":"cycle","offset":983},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":1105},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":1118}]}
