The loch contains many islands, including Inchmurrin, the largest fresh-water island in the British Isles. Loch Lomond is a popular leisure destination and is featured in song \"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond\".\nLoch Lomond lies on the Highland Boundary Fault, the boundary between the Lowlands of Central Scotland and the Highlands. It is 24 miles (39 kilometres) long and between 0.75 mile (1.21 km) and 5 miles (8 km) wide. It has an average depth of about 121 feet (37 metres), and a maximum depth of about 620 feet (190 metres). Its surface area is 27 square miles (71 km2), and it has a volume of 0.62 cubic miles (2.6 km3).\nOf all lochs and lakes in Great Britain, it is the largest by surface area, and the second largest (after Loch Ness) by water volume. Within the United Kingdom, it is surpassed only by Lough Neagh and Lower Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. In the British Isles as a whole there are several larger loughs in the Republic of Ireland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":17},{"uri":"Loch","surface_form":"loch","offset":37},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":88},{"uri":"Inchmurrin","surface_form":"Inchmurrin","offset":161},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":211},{"uri":"Highland_Boundary_Fault","surface_form":"Highland Boundary Fault","offset":354},{"uri":"Scottish_Lowlands","surface_form":"Lowlands","offset":404},{"uri":"Scottish_Highlands","surface_form":"Highlands","offset":441},{"uri":"Loch_Ness","surface_form":"Loch Ness","offset":855},{"uri":"Lough_Neagh","surface_form":"Lough Neagh","offset":934},{"uri":"Lower_Lough_Erne","surface_form":"Lower Lough Erne","offset":950},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":970},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":995},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Republic of Ireland","offset":1059}]}
