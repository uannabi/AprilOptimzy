Asperger syndrome (AS) was named after him. Today, Asperger syndrome is seen as a form of Autism. Asperger was born in Vienna and died there. Asperger studied medicine at the University of Vienna under Franz Hamburger. He married in 1935 and had five children.\nBecause he wrote in German, his work was not widely known. It was only in the 1980s that it was translated. One of his students translated it in honor of Asperger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austrians","surface_form":"Austrian","offset":60},{"uri":"Pediatrics","surface_form":"doctor of children","offset":69},{"uri":"Asperger_syndrome","surface_form":"Asperger syndrome","offset":89},{"uri":"Autism","surface_form":"Autism","offset":179},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":208}]}
