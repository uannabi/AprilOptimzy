A week later, he was signed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\nHis first appearance for WCW was at the WCW TV tapings at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. He turned heel, refereed Four Horsemen matches and aligned himself with Ric Flair. During his heel run, he favored the Horsemen in matches he refereed which annoyed Randy Savage. Savage, who was suspended by Flair (then-WCW President), proposed a match between Robinson and Savage's girlfriend Gorgeous George where if George defeated Robinson, Savage would be reinstated. The match took place on May 9, 1999 at \"Slamboree 1999\". Robinson (dubbed \"Little Naitch\") copied Flair's signature strut, \"wooo!\" catchphrase and even wore a robe similar to Flair's. Robinson would lose the match after George hit him with a diving elbow drop.\nWorld Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE.\nWhen the World Wrestling Federation bought WCW in March 2001, they hired Robinson. Robinson was a part of The Alliance. The first match that he refereed in the WWF was on July 2, 2001. Even though he was a part of the Alliance, he was mainly a fair and impartial referee. On the July 1, 2004 episode of \"SmackDown!\", he was forced to wrestle Luther Reigns by then-General Manager Kurt Angle. The match was quickly stopped by Charlie Haas however.\nOn April 18, 2014, while he was traveling with the WWE in Saudi Arabia, he suffered a freak accident after he nearly lost his thumb when he deeply cut it while helping to set up the wrestling ring. He received 6 stitches from a nearby WWE medic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":49},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":58},{"uri":"Referee_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"referee","offset":81},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":123},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":185},{"uri":"World_Championship_Wrestling","surface_form":"World Championship Wrestling","offset":463},{"uri":"Universal_Studios_Florida","surface_form":"Universal Studios","offset":557},{"uri":"Orlando%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Orlando, Florida","offset":578},{"uri":"Heel_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"heel","offset":606},{"uri":"Four_Horsemen_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"Four Horsemen","offset":621},{"uri":"Ric_Flair","surface_form":"Ric Flair","offset":668},{"uri":"Randy_Savage","surface_form":"Randy Savage","offset":761},{"uri":"Stephanie_Bellars","surface_form":"Gorgeous George","offset":890},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"World Wrestling Federation","offset":1285},{"uri":"The_Alliance_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"The Alliance","offset":1382},{"uri":"WWE_SmackDown","surface_form":"SmackDown!","offset":1580},{"uri":"Luther_Reigns","surface_form":"Luther Reigns","offset":1618},{"uri":"Kurt_Angle","surface_form":"Kurt Angle","offset":1656},{"uri":"Charlie_Haas","surface_form":"Charlie Haas","offset":1701},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":1781}]}
