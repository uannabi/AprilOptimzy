{"id":44850,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelsberg_Mountains","text":"The Vogelsberg Mountains are a group of low mountains in central Germany. They are in the middle of the state of Hessen. They are the product of ancient volcanic activity and are separated from the Rh\u00F6n Mountains by the Fulda River and its valley.\nThe Vogelsberg is about 19 million years old. It is Germany's only shield volcano. It is the largest basalt formation of Central Europe. It consists of many layers which fall downward from their peak in ring-shaped terraces to the base.\nThe highest mountains of the Vogelsberg are Taufstein, 773 m (2,536\u00A0ft), and Hoherodskopf, 763 m (2,503\u00A0ft). Both are now in a national park, the Hoher Vogelsberg Nature Reserve.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":65},{"uri":"Hessen","surface_form":"Hessen","offset":113},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":153},{"uri":"Rh%C3%B6n","surface_form":"Rh\u00F6n Mountains","offset":198},{"uri":"Fulda_River","surface_form":"Fulda River","offset":220},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"shield volcano","offset":315},{"uri":"Basalt","surface_form":"basalt","offset":349},{"uri":"Taufstein","surface_form":"Taufstein","offset":529},{"uri":"Hoherodskopf","surface_form":"Hoherodskopf","offset":562},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":612},{"uri":"Hoher_Vogelsberg_Nature_Reserve","surface_form":"Hoher Vogelsberg Nature Reserve","offset":631}]}
