{"id":448526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space","text":"An \"outcome\" is the result of a single execution of the model. Since individual outcomes might be of little practical use, more complex \"events\" are used to characterize groups of outcomes. The collection of all such events is a \"\u03C3-algebra\", sometimes written as formula_1. Finally, there is a need to specify each event's likelihood of happening. This is done using the \"probability measure\" function, \"P\".\nOnce the probability space is established, one usually assumes that \u201Cnature\u201D makes its move and selects a single outcome, \"\u03C9\", from the sample space \u03A9. All the events in formula_1 that contain the selected outcome \"\u03C9\" (recall that each event is a subset of \u03A9) are said to \u201Chave occurred\u201D. The selection performed by nature is done in such a way that if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times, then the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would coincide with the probabilities described by the function \"P\".\nThe prominent Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov introduced the notion of probability space, together with other axioms of probability, in the 1930s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%CF%83-algebra","surface_form":"\u03C3-algebra","offset":230},{"uri":"Probability_measure","surface_form":"probability measure","offset":372},{"uri":"Andrey_Kolmogorov","surface_form":"Andrey Kolmogorov","offset":995},{"uri":"Axioms_of_probability","surface_form":"axioms of probability","offset":1077}]}
