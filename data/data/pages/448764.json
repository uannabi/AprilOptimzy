{"id":448764,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_nut","text":"Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus \"Pinus\"). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting. Other pines have edible seeds too small to be useful as a human food.\nPine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are often added to meat, fish, salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread. In Italian they are called \"pinoli\". They are an essential part of Italian pesto sauce.\nPine nuts can be pressed to extract pine nut oil, which is valued for its mild, nutty flavour. The large edible seeds of the Southern Hemisphere conifer genus \"Araucaria\" produce nuts rather like pine nuts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":25},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"pine","offset":34},{"uri":"Pinaceae","surface_form":"Pinaceae","offset":48},{"uri":"Paleolithic","surface_form":"Paleolithic","offset":275},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":319},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":325},{"uri":"Salads","surface_form":"salads","offset":331},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":342},{"uri":"Baking","surface_form":"baked","offset":362},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":373},{"uri":"Pesto","surface_form":"pesto","offset":455},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":461},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":513},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":593},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":613},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":621},{"uri":"Araucaria","surface_form":"Araucaria","offset":628}]}
