{"id":448810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority","text":"Argument from authority or appeal to authority is a form of argument or reasoning that could become a fallacy if it is misused.\nThe argument may be right in many cases, but it might be wrong in other cases. In cases where the argument is wrong, it would be a fallacy. Therefore, the appeal to authority is not a generally strong argument for proving facts.\nAn example of a poor appeal to authority is if someone says that \"God doesn't exist. I know because Stephen Hawking said so.\" This is a poor example because even though almost everyone who knows about Stephen Hawking would agree that he was very intelligent man, his knowledge about physics (which he was a professor of) is not important to knowing about whether or not God exists.\nAn example of a good appeal to authority is if a someone says \u201CI need to take my medicine. I know so because my doctor prescribed it,\u201D This is believable because most doctors have a lot of knowledge and training in how to improve people's health, and it is very likely that the doctor has given similar prescriptions many times before.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":60},{"uri":"Reason","surface_form":"reason","offset":72},{"uri":"Fallacy","surface_form":"fallacy","offset":102},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":640},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":664},{"uri":"Prescription","surface_form":"prescriptions","offset":1042}]}
