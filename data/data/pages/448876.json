{"id":448876,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transglutaminase","text":"A transglutaminase is an enzyme that forms a chemical bond between two protein molecules. The reaction also produces a molecule of ammonia. Transglutaminases were first described in 1959. In 1968 it was discovered they form a role in blood coagulation.\nTransglutaminase have many uses. They can be used as a binding agent to improve the texture of protein-rich foods such as surimi or ham. Other examples of foods made using transglutaminase include imitation crabmeat, and fish balls.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":25},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"chemical bond","offset":45},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":71},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":79},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"reaction","offset":94},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":131},{"uri":"Coagulation","surface_form":"blood coagulation","offset":234},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"binding agent","offset":308},{"uri":"Texture","surface_form":"texture","offset":337},{"uri":"Surimi","surface_form":"surimi","offset":375},{"uri":"Ham","surface_form":"ham","offset":385},{"uri":"Imitation_crabmeat","surface_form":"imitation crabmeat","offset":450},{"uri":"Fish_ball","surface_form":"fish ball","offset":474}]}
