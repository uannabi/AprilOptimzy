{"id":448891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_cloud","text":"Wall clouds (or pedestal clouds) are localized, large and persistent lowering cloud formations that develop below the rain-free region of thunderstorms. Rotating wall clouds are indicative of mesocyclones in thunderstorms. Wall clouds do not always rotate, though.\nWall clouds are formed by a process known as entrainment, when an inflow of warm, moist air rises and overpowers rain-cooled air during a downwind downdraft.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"thunderstorm","offset":138}]}
