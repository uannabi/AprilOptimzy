{"id":449112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_2010","text":"The Equality Act 2010 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nBefore 2010, there were many different Acts (laws) and Regulations (rules) in Great Britain which protected against different kinds of discrimination. The Equality Act's goal was to put all of these laws and protections together into one law, and make it easier to understand.\nWhat does the Equality Act say?\nThe Equality Act has the same goals as the four major European Union Equal Treatment Directives (laws made by the European Union that protect against discrimination).\nThe Act says that all of these groups must be treated equally at work, when applying for jobs, and in private and public services.\nPeople with disabilities have special protections under the Act. The Act says that employers and service providers (like stores or schools) have to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities if needed. Reasonable accommodations are changes to places or ways of doing things that help people with disabilities do their jobs, go to school, and do other important things just like people without disabilities can. Accommodations do not have to be made if they are not reasonable (if they would be very expensive or difficult to make).\nMost of the Equality Act does not apply to Northern Ireland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Parliament of the United Kingdom","offset":35},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":147},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":204},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":432},{"uri":"Reasonable_accommodation","surface_form":"reasonable accommodations","offset":829},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":1268}]}
