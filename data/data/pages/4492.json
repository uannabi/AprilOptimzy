{"id":4492,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis","text":"Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.), though \"analysis\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.\nThe word comes from the Ancient Greek \u1F00\u03BD\u03AC\u03BB\u03C5\u03C3\u03B9\u03C2 (\"analusis\", \"a breaking up\", from \"ana-\" \"up, throughout\" and \"lysis\" \"a loosening\").\nIn this context, Analysis is the opposite of synthesis, which is to bring ideas together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Complexity","surface_form":"complex topic","offset":38},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":169},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":185},{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":204},{"uri":"Before_Christ","surface_form":"B.C.","offset":223},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":328},{"uri":"Opposite","surface_form":"opposite","offset":471},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesis","offset":483}]}
