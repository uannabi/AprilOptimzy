At the periodic table of the elements it is at position 107.\nThe element is named in honor of Niels Bohr.\nMendeleev predicted that Bohrium would exist. He called the element eka-rhenium because of its location was near Rhenium in the Periodic Table. The chemistry of bohrium is like the chemistry of rhenium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":25},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":50},{"uri":"Niels_Bohr","surface_form":"Niels Bohr","offset":137},{"uri":"Mendeleev","surface_form":"Mendeleev","offset":149},{"uri":"Rhenium","surface_form":"Rhenium","offset":262},{"uri":"Periodic_Table","surface_form":"Periodic Table","offset":277},{"uri":"Rhenium","surface_form":"rhenium","offset":343}]}
