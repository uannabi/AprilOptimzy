{"id":449449,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol","text":"An in the Japanese pop culture is a young media personality (a singer, an actor, a model, etc.). This is usually a teenager, who has a cute and innocent public image. Idols are a separate category of Japanese artists.\nThe term is commercialized by Japanese talent agents. The talent agencies hold auditions for cute boys and girls and make them stars. Idols are intended to be an ideal object of love of frenzied fans. There is also a view that the Japanese people see idols as sisters or girls next door.\nJapanese idol singers work across genres of the Japanese pop music. This is usually whatever is most popular at the moment. Their songs do not require great singing skills, but the artist must be beautiful, sweet and nice to sing them. In their everyday life, idols must also match the songs they sing. They must have a perfect public image and be good examples to young people.\nHistory.\nThe phenomenon appeared in the early 1970s. It was thanks to the popularity of young French actress Sylvie Vartan and the movie she played in called \"Cherchez l'idole\" (\"Look for the Idol\"). The movie came out in Japan in November 1964 under the title \"Aidoru o Sagase\". The term \"idol\" started being used for girls, mostly between 14 and 16, who were just beginning their path to stardom or for very young new stars.\nSelective list of Japanese idol music groups.\nThis is a selective list of Japanese idol music groups, divided by projects or talent agencies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":10},{"uri":"Pop_culture","surface_form":"pop culture","offset":19},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":42},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":63},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":74},{"uri":"Model_(person)","surface_form":"model","offset":83},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenager","offset":115},{"uri":"Category","surface_form":"category","offset":188},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":209},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commercialized","offset":230},{"uri":"Talent_agent","surface_form":"talent agent","offset":257},{"uri":"Audition","surface_form":"audition","offset":297},{"uri":"Celebrity","surface_form":"stars","offset":345},{"uri":"Fanatic","surface_form":"fans","offset":413},{"uri":"Girl_next_door","surface_form":"girls next door","offset":489},{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":540},{"uri":"J-pop","surface_form":"Japanese pop music","offset":554},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"skill","offset":671},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":859},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":898},{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popularity","offset":959},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":979},{"uri":"Actress","surface_form":"actress","offset":986},{"uri":"Sylvie_Vartan","surface_form":"Sylvie Vartan","offset":994},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":1016},{"uri":"Project","surface_form":"project","offset":1425},{"uri":"Agency","surface_form":"agencies","offset":1444}]}
