{"id":449716,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie","text":"A selfie is a self-portrait photograph. It is typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone.\nSelfies are often shared on social networking services such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr. They are often casual, and are typically taken either with a camera held at arm's length or in a mirror. Some people use a \"selfie stick\" to hold the camera.\nOne of the first self-portraits was taken in 1839 by Robert Cornelius, an American photographer. The term \"selfie\" was first used by photographer Jim Krause in 2005.\nSelfies by animals.\nA black crested macaque (\"Macaca nigra\") stole a camera, and took a photo of herself. The selfie seemed to set a legal precedent when the Wikimedia Foundation rejected a copyright claim. The ground was that a non-human could not own a copyright, and the camera owner had not taken the photo, and so also could not own the copyright. And so, the photo was not under copyright.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Self-portrait","surface_form":"self-portrait","offset":14},{"uri":"Digital_camera","surface_form":"digital camera","offset":79},{"uri":"Camera_phone","surface_form":"camera phone","offset":97},{"uri":"Social_networking_service","surface_form":"social networking service","offset":139},{"uri":"Instagram","surface_form":"Instagram","offset":174},{"uri":"Snapchat","surface_form":"Snapchat","offset":185},{"uri":"Tumblr","surface_form":"Tumblr","offset":199},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":268},{"uri":"Mirror","surface_form":"mirror","offset":304},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":439},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":448},{"uri":"Macaque","surface_form":"macaque","offset":567},{"uri":"Precedent","surface_form":"precedent","offset":670},{"uri":"Wikimedia_Foundation","surface_form":"Wikimedia Foundation","offset":689},{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":721}]}
