{"id":449958,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrarchidae","text":"Centrarchidae or sunfish are a family of freshwater ray-finned fish. They belonging to the order Perciformes. The type genus is \"Centrarchus\" (consisting solely of the flier, \"C. macropterus\"). The family's 37 species include many fish familiar to North Americans, including the rock bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and crappies. All are native only to North America. Family members are distinguished by having from five to 13 dorsal spines number. Sizes of most are in the range. However, some are much smaller, with the black-banded sunfish at just in length, while the largemouth bass is reported to reach almost in extreme cases.\nThe male of most species builds a nest by hollowing out a depression using his tail, then guards the eggs. Most sunfish are valued for sport fishing. They have been introduced in many areas outside their original ranges, sometimes becoming an invasive species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":31},{"uri":"Ray-finned_fish","surface_form":"ray-finned fish","offset":52},{"uri":"Perciformes","surface_form":"Perciformes","offset":97},{"uri":"Type_genus","surface_form":"type genus","offset":114},{"uri":"Centrarchus","surface_form":"Centrarchus","offset":129},{"uri":"Flier_(fish)","surface_form":"flier","offset":168},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":248},{"uri":"Rock_bass","surface_form":"rock bass","offset":279},{"uri":"Largemouth_bass","surface_form":"largemouth bass","offset":290},{"uri":"Bluegill","surface_form":"bluegill","offset":307},{"uri":"Pumpkinseed","surface_form":"pumpkinseed","offset":317},{"uri":"Crappie","surface_form":"crappie","offset":334},{"uri":"Dorsal","surface_form":"dorsal","offset":441},{"uri":"Enneacanthus_chaetodon","surface_form":"black-banded sunfish","offset":536},{"uri":"Largemouth_bass","surface_form":"largemouth bass","offset":586},{"uri":"Nest","surface_form":"nest","offset":682},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":727},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":749},{"uri":"Sport_fishing","surface_form":"sport fishing","offset":783},{"uri":"Range_(biology)","surface_form":"ranges","offset":861},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive species","offset":891}]}
