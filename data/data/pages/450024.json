{"id":450024,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation","text":"Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the breasts when a mother feeds her young. It occurs with almost almost all female mammals after the birth of their young. In humans the process is also called \"breastfeeding\" or \"nursing\".\nIn most species, milk comes out of the mother's nipples. The platypus (which is a monotreme mammal) releases milk through ducts in its abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat, is milk production a normal male function.\nMilk contains fat, lactose, and protein, as well and vitamins and minerals.\nApart from food nutrients, mothers' milk contains a range of antibodies which protect the baby until it develops its own immune system. When born, a baby has IgG antibodies from across the mother's placenta. Its own immunoglobulin production takes about six months to develop after birth, so meantime the mother's milk supplies IgA as a stop-gap protection.\nMilk production requires the hormones prolactin and oxytocin.\nMeaning: since the skin of synapsids had glands in it, the development of milk production was possible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":37},{"uri":"Mammary_gland","surface_form":"breasts","offset":51},{"uri":"Mother","surface_form":"mother","offset":66},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":130},{"uri":"Breastfeeding","surface_form":"breastfeeding","offset":208},{"uri":"Nipples","surface_form":"nipples","offset":285},{"uri":"Platypus","surface_form":"platypus","offset":298},{"uri":"Monotreme","surface_form":"monotreme","offset":319},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":393},{"uri":"Dayak_fruit_bat","surface_form":"Dayak fruit bat","offset":416},{"uri":"Antibodies","surface_form":"antibodies","offset":613},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune system","offset":673},{"uri":"Placenta","surface_form":"placenta","offset":750},{"uri":"Immunoglobulin","surface_form":"immunoglobulin","offset":768},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"Milk","offset":910},{"uri":"Hormones","surface_form":"hormones","offset":939},{"uri":"Prolactin","surface_form":"prolactin","offset":948},{"uri":"Oxytocin","surface_form":"oxytocin","offset":962}]}
