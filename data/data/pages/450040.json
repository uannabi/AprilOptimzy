{"id":450040,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, modulo operation, represented by the symbol formula_1, returns the remainder of an integer division (also known as Euclidean division), where the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder.\nMore specifically, given an integer formula_1 and a non-zero integer formula_1, the expression formula_1 refers to the remainder of the division formula_1. Here, formula_1 is also known as the dividend; formula_1 is also known as the divisor (or the modulus), and the remainder can be also called the least non-negative residue.\nHowever, other conventions and definitions of the modulo operation are also possible, since computers and calculators have various ways of storing and representing numbers. Their definition of the modulo operation depends on the programming language and/or the underlying hardware.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":96},{"uri":"Integers","surface_form":"integers","offset":191},{"uri":"Quotient","surface_form":"quotient","offset":211},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":226},{"uri":"Computers","surface_form":"computers","offset":658},{"uri":"Calculators","surface_form":"calculators","offset":672},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":795},{"uri":"Computer_hardware","surface_form":"hardware","offset":838}]}
