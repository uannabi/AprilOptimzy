{"id":450166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopsis","text":"\"Lycopsis\" is an extinct genus of South American metatherian. It lived during the Miocene of what is now Colombia.\n\"Lycopsis\" was more likely an ambush hunter than a pounce-pursuit predator, stalking small-to medium-sized prey. The borhyaenids in general were once arboreal, and later changed their life-style to one of living on the ground. The skeleton of \"Lycopsis\" has a mosaic of features which show it was not yet a fast runner on the ground.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":25},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":34},{"uri":"Metatheria","surface_form":"metatheria","offset":49},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":82},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":105},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":265},{"uri":"Life-style","surface_form":"life-style","offset":299},{"uri":"Mosaic_evolution","surface_form":"mosaic","offset":375}]}
