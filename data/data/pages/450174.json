It is found along the White River, and the reservoir it forms is Lake Taneycomo. It is the first hydroelectric dam built in Missouri. It was designed in 1911 by Nils F. Ambursen. Powersite was the largest concrete buttress dam of its kind. The dam is still privately owned by the Empire District Electric Company.\nIn July 2015 the dam was damaged due to heavy flooding. The water levels in Lake Taneycomo had to be lowered to allow for inspection and repairs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hydroelectric_dam","surface_form":"hydroelectric dam","offset":19},{"uri":"Forsyth%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Forsyth, Missouri","offset":71},{"uri":"White_River_(Arkansas)","surface_form":"White River","offset":112},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":133},{"uri":"Lake_Taneycomo","surface_form":"Lake Taneycomo","offset":155},{"uri":"Hydroelectric","surface_form":"hydroelectric","offset":187},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":201},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":214},{"uri":"Empire_District_Electric_Company","surface_form":"Empire District Electric Company","offset":370}]}
