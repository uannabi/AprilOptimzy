{"id":450287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_hatchery","text":"A fish hatchery is where fish are hatched and cared for, usually to be released in natural waters (rivers, lakes, etc.). They may also be transferred to Fish farms and raised for food. Fish hatcheries and farms (also called aquaculture) are either commercial or run by a state, province, or country. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include Pacific oysters, shrimp, prawns, salmon, tilapia and scallops. In the United States in particular, many species of game fish are raised in hatcheries. These include black bass, trout, walleye, Northern pike, and Muskellunge.\nThe value of global aquaculture production is estimated to be US$98.4 billion in 2008 with China significantly dominating the market. However, the value of aquaculture hatchery and nursery production has yet to be estimated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":99},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":107},{"uri":"Fish_farm","surface_form":"Fish farm","offset":153},{"uri":"Aquaculture","surface_form":"aquaculture","offset":224},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commercial","offset":248},{"uri":"US_state","surface_form":"state","offset":271},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":278},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":291},{"uri":"Ostreidae","surface_form":"Pacific oysters","offset":360},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":377},{"uri":"Prawn","surface_form":"prawn","offset":385},{"uri":"Salmon","surface_form":"salmon","offset":393},{"uri":"Tilapia","surface_form":"tilapia","offset":401},{"uri":"Scallop","surface_form":"scallop","offset":413},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":430},{"uri":"Game_fish","surface_form":"game fish","offset":475},{"uri":"Black_bass","surface_form":"black bass","offset":525},{"uri":"Trout","surface_form":"trout","offset":537},{"uri":"Walleye","surface_form":"walleye","offset":544},{"uri":"Northern_pike","surface_form":"Northern pike","offset":553},{"uri":"Muskellunge","surface_form":"Muskellunge","offset":572}]}
