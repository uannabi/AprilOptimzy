The number is occasionally called Euler's number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, or Napier's constant in honor of the Scottish mathematician John Napier who introduced logarithms. It is equally important in mathematics as \u03C0 and i. is an irrational number, and Euler himself gave the first 23 digits of.\nThe number has great importance in mathematics, as do 0, 1, Pi, and Imaginary unit. All five of these numbers are important and occur again and again in mathematics. The five constants appear in one formulation of Euler's identity. Like the constant, is also irrational (it cannot be represented as a ratio of integers) and transcendental (it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients).\nThe number is very important for exponential functions. For example, the exponential function applied to the number one, has a value of.\nAlternate definitions of .\nIn other words, there is a number that the expression formula_1 approaches as \"n\" becomes larger.
