Since 2002 it has been listed as least concern by IUCN. It is widely distributed, but habitat loss and hunting occurs in places. There are twelve leopard cat subspecies, which differ widely in appearance.\nThe small cat is not closely related to the leopard. Its leopard-like spots gave it the name.\nDistribution.\nLeopard cats are the most widely distributed Asian small cats. Their range extends from the Russian Far East, Korea, China, Indochina, the Indian subcontinent, northern Pakistan, the Philippines and the Sunda islands of Indonesia.\nThey prefer forested habitats, but are found in agriculturally used areas. They live in tropical evergreen rainforests and plantations at sea level, and in subtropical deciduous and conifer forests in the foothills of the Himalayas above.\nThe highest altitudinal record was at in the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area.\nIn the northeast of their range they live close to rivers, valleys and in ravine forests, but avoid areas with more than of snowfall. They are rare in Pakistan\u2019s dry treeless areas. In Afghanistan, they were reported in the 1970s from Jalalkot and Norgul in the Kunar Valley, and the Waygul forest of Dare Pech.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"wild cat","offset":56},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South","offset":68},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":78},{"uri":"Least_concern","surface_form":"least concern","offset":122},{"uri":"International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":139},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":247},{"uri":"Leopard","surface_form":"leopard","offset":338},{"uri":"Russian_Far_East","surface_form":"Russian Far East","offset":494},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":512},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":519},{"uri":"Indochina","surface_form":"Indochina","offset":526},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":541},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":571},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":585},{"uri":"Sunda_islands","surface_form":"Sunda islands","offset":605},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":622},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":721},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":730},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":740},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":756},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":771},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":789},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":801},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":815},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":823},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":855},{"uri":"Kanchenjunga","surface_form":"Kanchenjunga","offset":917},{"uri":"Ravine","surface_form":"ravine","offset":1023},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":1100},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":1134},{"uri":"Kunar_Valley","surface_form":"Kunar Valley","offset":1211},{"uri":"Dara-I-Pech_District","surface_form":"Dare Pech","offset":1250}]}
