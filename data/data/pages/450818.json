When she was asked about it, she answered: \"I was. I attended a few events and WrestleMania VI. My dad is a concert promoter and he\u2019d get me into the events. I remember being backstage and meeting \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, Triple H, Chyna and Trish Stratus as a kid, so it\u2019s really funny to me that I ended up here. I went on a different path than wanting to become a WWE Superstar. I have a broadcasting and performance background.\"\nThe Score (2009\u20132012).\nShe started her career by working with The Score.
