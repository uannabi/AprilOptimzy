{"id":450850,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_cat","text":"The fishing cat (\"Prionailurus viverrinus\") is a medium-sized wild cat of South and Southeast Asia. Fishing cats are the largest of the \"Prionailurus\" cats. They are about twice the size of a domestic cat and have a stocky, muscular build with medium to short legs.\nIn 2008, the IUCN classified the fishing cat as endangered. They live in wetland habitats, which are increasingly being settled, degraded and converted. Over the last decade, the fishing cat population throughout much of its Asian range declined severely.\nLike its closest relative, the leopard cat, the fishing cat lives along rivers, streams and mangrove swamps. It is well adapted to this habitat, being an eager and skilled swimmer. Its feet are partly webbed, and it does catch fish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"cat","offset":67},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South","offset":74},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":84},{"uri":"Prionailurus","surface_form":"Prionailurus","offset":137},{"uri":"IUCN","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":279},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":314},{"uri":"Wetland","surface_form":"wetland","offset":339},{"uri":"Leopard_cat","surface_form":"leopard cat","offset":553},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":602},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":614},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":623},{"uri":"Webbed_feet","surface_form":"webbed","offset":723}]}
