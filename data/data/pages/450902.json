{"id":450902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, divergence is a differential operator that associates a vector field with a scalar field. In a vector field, each point of the field is associated with a vector; in a scalar field, each point of the field is associated with a scalar.\nGiven a vector field formula_1, the divergence of formula_1 can be written as formula_1 or formula_1, where formula_1 is the gradient and formula_1 is the dot product operation.\nDivergence is used to formulate Maxwell's equations and the continuity equation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Differential_operator","surface_form":"differential operator","offset":45},{"uri":"Vector_field","surface_form":"vector field","offset":85},{"uri":"Scalar_field","surface_form":"scalar field","offset":105},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":183},{"uri":"Scalar","surface_form":"scalar","offset":255},{"uri":"Gradient","surface_form":"gradient","offset":388},{"uri":"Dot_product","surface_form":"dot product","offset":418},{"uri":"Maxwell%27s_equations","surface_form":"Maxwell's equations","offset":473},{"uri":"Continuity_equation","surface_form":"continuity equation","offset":501}]}
