{"id":450903,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia_praecox","text":"Dementia praecox is a term which B\u00E9n\u00E9dict Augustin Morel first used in 1860, to describe the condition of a teenager who retreated from society, and started to show symptoms similar to those of dementia. Dementia is a mental illness which mostly occurs in old people.\nEmil Kraepelin used the term to describe, and contrasted it with the mental illness called Bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder often have episodes in which they seem normal, which people with \"dementia praecox\" do not.\nThis theory could not be proved. In 1911, Eugen Bleuler said that \"dementia praecox\" was actually schizophrenia. The word Schizophrenia was not used widely before 1925.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dict_Augustin_Morel","surface_form":"B\u00E9n\u00E9dict Augustin Morel","offset":33},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenager","offset":108},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":165},{"uri":"Dementia","surface_form":"dementia","offset":194},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illness","offset":218},{"uri":"Emil_Kraepelin","surface_form":"Emil Kraepelin","offset":268},{"uri":"Bipolar_disorder","surface_form":"Bipolar disorder","offset":359},{"uri":"Eugen_Bleuler","surface_form":"Eugen Bleuler","offset":540},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":596}]}
