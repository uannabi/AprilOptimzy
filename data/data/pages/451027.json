{"id":451027,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quapaw","text":"The Quapaw people are a tribe of Native Americans. From the 17th century they resided on the west side of the Mississippi River in what is now the state of Arkansas. The territory and state was named for them, as Europeans first learned their name as the \"Arkansea\". This was the term used by the Algonquian-speaking Illini people. They are among the Siouan-speaking peoples west of the Mississippi.\nThe Quapaw are federally recognized as the \"Quapaw Tribe of Indians\". Since removal in 1834, their tribal base has been in present-day Oklahoma. The number of members enrolled in the tribe is 3,240.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":24},{"uri":"Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":33},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":60},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":93},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":110},{"uri":"States_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"state","offset":147},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":156},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":170},{"uri":"Algonquian_languages","surface_form":"Algonquian","offset":297},{"uri":"Illiniwek","surface_form":"Illini people","offset":317},{"uri":"Siouan_languages","surface_form":"Siouan","offset":351},{"uri":"Federally_recognized_tribes","surface_form":"federally recognized","offset":415},{"uri":"Indian_Removal_Act","surface_form":"removal","offset":476},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":535}]}
