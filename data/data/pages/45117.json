The treaty was signed in Warsaw, on 14 May 1955 and official copies were made in the languages of Russian, Polish, Czech and German. The Pact lasted until the end of the Cold War when some members quit in 1991, following the collapse of the Eastern bloc and political changes in the Soviet Union.\nMembers.\nAll the Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe signed except Yugoslavia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["organization"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central","offset":112},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":124},{"uri":"Communist_state","surface_form":"Communist state","offset":141},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":352},{"uri":"Warsaw","surface_form":"Warsaw","offset":396},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":404},{"uri":"North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation","surface_form":"North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)","offset":451},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":497},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":591},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":600},{"uri":"Czech_language","surface_form":"Czech","offset":608},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":618},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":663},{"uri":"Eastern_Bloc","surface_form":"Eastern bloc","offset":734},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":776},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central","offset":827},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":839},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":868}]}
