{"id":45118,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe","text":"Central Europe is the region around the Alps and Carpathian Mountains lying between the areas of Eastern and Western Europe. The understanding of the concept of \"Central Europe\" varies considerably from nation to nation, and also has from time to time.\nAlternative Definitions.\nIf one were to divide the continent of Europe into two halves like it was during the Cold War, the Iron Curtain would subsequently split the mainstream definition of \"Central Europe\" in half. When using this definition, the countries of Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia would be included in Eastern Europe: whereas the countries of Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland would be considered Western Europe instead. Some experts consider this definition outdated, but many still use them. Supranational organizations like the UN and EU also make use of them.\nIn addition, other countries such as Croatia and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia can be included in \"Central Europe\": though they are now mostly considered a part of either Southern Europe or Northern Europe respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":22},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":40},{"uri":"Carpathian_Mountains","surface_form":"Carpathian Mountains","offset":49},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern","offset":97},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western","offset":109},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":117},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":363},{"uri":"Iron_Curtain","surface_form":"Iron Curtain","offset":377},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":591},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":700},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"UN","offset":834},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"EU","offset":841},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":904},{"uri":"Latvia","surface_form":"Latvia","offset":937},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":945},{"uri":"Estonia","surface_form":"Estonia","offset":959}]}
