{"id":451183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_River_(Missouri)","text":"The James River is a river in southern Missouri. Its source is near the town of Diggins in Webster County. It begins on a northwesterly course, then turns southwest near Northview. It passes down the east side of Springfield where a dam creates Lake Springfield. From Springfield, it flows west and then south to Galena. Shortly after Galena it enters Table Rock Lake. Before the dam that created Table Rock Lake, the James River emptied into the White River.\nLarge sections of the James River are used by canoes or kayaks. A solid 3-day float from the spillway below Lake Springfield to Galena is possible when the levels are high enough. There are several access points along the river. These offer a variety of amenities including fishing and boat rentals.\nThe James River is not a water source for the city of Springfield. However, Springfield Lake is a primary source of water for the cooling system at the Southeast Power Plant which sits by the dam. James River Freeway on the city's south side is named after the river. The river's unusual green stain is from copper-fixing bacteria present in the waters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":21},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":30},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":39},{"uri":"River_source","surface_form":"source","offset":53},{"uri":"Diggins%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Diggins","offset":80},{"uri":"Webster_County%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Webster County","offset":91},{"uri":"Northwest","surface_form":"northwest","offset":122},{"uri":"Southwest","surface_form":"southwest","offset":155},{"uri":"Northview%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Northview","offset":170},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"east","offset":200},{"uri":"Springfield%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Springfield","offset":213},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":233},{"uri":"Galena%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Galena","offset":313},{"uri":"Table_Rock_Lake","surface_form":"Table Rock Lake","offset":352},{"uri":"White_River_(Arkansas)","surface_form":"White River","offset":447},{"uri":"Canoe","surface_form":"canoe","offset":506},{"uri":"Kayak","surface_form":"kayak","offset":516},{"uri":"Galena%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Galena","offset":588},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":734},{"uri":"James_River_Freeway","surface_form":"James River Freeway","offset":957},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":1068}]}
