{"id":451380,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Buckland","text":"William Buckland DD FRS (12 March 1784 \u2013 14 August 1856) was an English theologian who became Dean of Westminster. He was also a geologist and palaeontologist.\nBuckland wrote the first full account of a fossil dinosaur, which he named \"Megalosaurus\". He proved that Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire had been a prehistoric hyena den, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society. He was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past. He was a pioneer in the use of fossilized faeces (he coined the term coprolites) to reconstruct ancient ecosystems.\nIn 1818, Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He became Reader in Geology at Oxford University in 1819. His work \"Reliqui\u00E6 Diluvian\u00E6\" was published in 1823 and became a best seller.\nHowever, over the next decade Buckland changed his mind. In his famous Bridgewater Treatise, \"Geology and mineralogy considered with reference to natural theology\", he said that the biblical account of Noah's flood could not be confirmed using geological evidence. What had been taken as evidence of the 'Universal Deluge' two decades before was, he thought, evidence of a major glaciation.\nNot only was Buckland's home filled with specimens \u2013 animal as well as mineral, live as well as dead \u2013 but he claimed to have eaten much of the animal kingdom, a practice known as zo\u00F6phagy. In 1848 a piece of Louis XIV's mummified heart, taken from his tomb, was kept in a silver locket by the Archbishop of York. It was shown to Buckland, who ate it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Doctor_of_Divinity","surface_form":"DD","offset":17},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":20},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":64},{"uri":"Theologian","surface_form":"theologian","offset":72},{"uri":"Dean","surface_form":"Dean","offset":94},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":102},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geologist","offset":129},{"uri":"Paleontology","surface_form":"palaeontologist","offset":143},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":203},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":210},{"uri":"Megalosaurus","surface_form":"Megalosaurus","offset":236},{"uri":"Kirkdale_Cave","surface_form":"Kirkdale Cave","offset":266},{"uri":"Yorkshire","surface_form":"Yorkshire","offset":283},{"uri":"Hyena","surface_form":"hyena","offset":316},{"uri":"Copley_Medal","surface_form":"Copley Medal","offset":356},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":376},{"uri":"Faeces","surface_form":"faeces","offset":537},{"uri":"Coprolite","surface_form":"coprolite","offset":564},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":599},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":657},{"uri":"Oxford_University","surface_form":"Oxford University","offset":703},{"uri":"Noah","surface_form":"Noah","offset":1010},{"uri":"Glaciation","surface_form":"glaciation","offset":1187},{"uri":"Zo%C3%B6phagy","surface_form":"zo\u00F6phagy","offset":1379},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":1408},{"uri":"Archbishop_of_York","surface_form":"Archbishop of York","offset":1493}]}
