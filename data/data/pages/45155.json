{"id":45155,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion","text":"Onions are vegetables. They are plants in the genus \"Allium\". When people talk about onions, they usually mean \"garden onions\". Most species of onions have bulbs that people can eat. They have a strong flavour and a very distinctive smell.\nOnions have been grown for a very long time. They were probably first grown in Ancient Egypt, together with leek and garlic, but maybe earlier. Now, most of the world's cultures eat onions.\nHow onions are grown.\nFarmers and gardeners can grow onions from seeds or from bulbs. If they plant seeds, they must later pull out most of the young plants so the rest can grow better. This is called 'thinning.' A different way to plant onions is to plant young bulbs. This is faster, but the onions that grow this way are weaker than the onions that started as seeds.\nWhy onions make eyes water.\nWhen you cut an onion, you open some cells of the onion. Then, some chemicals react. When one chemical floats through the air and reaches your eyes, they sting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":11},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":32},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":46},{"uri":"Bulb","surface_form":"bulbs","offset":156},{"uri":"Flavour","surface_form":"flavour","offset":202},{"uri":"Odor","surface_form":"smell","offset":233},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":319},{"uri":"Leek","surface_form":"leek","offset":348},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":357},{"uri":"Cells","surface_form":"cells","offset":865}]}
