They are burrowing insectivores\nThere is only one genus, \"Solenodon\", They keep some primitive mammal characteristics. Their species resemble closely those which lived near the end of the age of the dinosaurs.\nThe two living solenodon species are the Cuban Solenodon (\"Solenodon cubanus\"), and the Haitian or Hispaniolan solenodon (\"Solenodon paradoxus\"). The Hispaniolan solenodon lives in many habitats on the island of Hispaniola from lowland dry forest to highland pine forest. Two other described species went extinct during the Quaternary. Oligocene North American genera, such as \"Apternodus\", have been suggested as relatives of \"Solenodon\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venom","surface_form":"venom","offset":43},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":53},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":63},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":78},{"uri":"Insectivores","surface_form":"insectivores","offset":120},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":151},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"primitive","offset":186},{"uri":"Cuban_Solenodon","surface_form":"Cuban Solenodon","offset":352},{"uri":"Haitian","surface_form":"Haitian","offset":399},{"uri":"Hispaniolan_solenodon","surface_form":"Hispaniolan solenodon","offset":410},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":523},{"uri":"Quaternary","surface_form":"Quaternary","offset":635},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":647},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":657},{"uri":"Apternodus","surface_form":"Apternodus","offset":689}]}
