The Industrial Revolution started around 1750 in England, and fifty years later in the United States. This was because there was a lot of land to work on, but there was too less labour to do that. The industrial machines were expensive.\nSamuel Slater.\nThe start of the Industrial Revolution in America is caused by Samuel Slater, who built the first industrial mill in the United States around 1790. His cotton mill looked a lot like the British mill. But through this mill, the speed with which cotton thread could be spun into yarn was greatly increased.\nAnother cause of the rapidly changing economy were the new organizational strategies to increase the speed to make the products. This reformation was especially important for the shoe and boot industry. Were first the most products were made by hand.\nBut the most important change was the \u201CFactory System\u201D where products were produced on a large scale and then one specific product, but they needed people to operate the machines. A group of businessman called the Boston Associates recruited thousands farm girls from New England to operate the machines in the new factories.\nLowell.\nOne of the most known mill towns was Lowell, Massachusetts, which opened in 1823. The use of a female factory workers had advantages to both employer and employee. The Boston Associates preferred the young girls because they paid young girls less than men. These female factory workers were often called: Lowell Girls, named to the place Lowell.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":24},{"uri":"States_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"states","offset":86},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":147},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":179},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":185},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":198},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":228},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"presidents","offset":257},{"uri":"Industrial_Revolution","surface_form":"Industrial Revolution","offset":273},{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":325},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":354},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":389},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":442},{"uri":"War_of_1812","surface_form":"1812","offset":459},{"uri":"Alfred_Nobel","surface_form":"Alfred Nobel","offset":473},{"uri":"Invented","surface_form":"invented","offset":486},{"uri":"Dynamite","surface_form":"dynamite","offset":495},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"Basketball","offset":518},{"uri":"William_Austin_Burt","surface_form":"William Austin Burt","offset":552},{"uri":"Typographer_(typewriter)","surface_form":"Typographer","offset":603},{"uri":"Typewriter","surface_form":"typewriter","offset":646},{"uri":"Great_Chicago_Fire","surface_form":"Great Chicago Fire","offset":688},{"uri":"Great_September_Gale_of_1815","surface_form":"Great September Gale of 1815","offset":737},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":881},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":961},{"uri":"William_McKinley","surface_form":"William McKinley","offset":1017},{"uri":"Democratic-Republican_Party","surface_form":"Democratic-Republican Party","offset":1474},{"uri":"Monticello","surface_form":"Monticello","offset":1583},{"uri":"Abraham_Lincoln","surface_form":"Abraham Lincoln","offset":1612},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":1794},{"uri":"Mary_Todd_Lincoln","surface_form":"Mary Todd","offset":1820},{"uri":"Whig_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Whig Party","offset":1905},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":1930},{"uri":"Assassinated","surface_form":"assassinated","offset":1955},{"uri":"Martin_van_Buren","surface_form":"Martin van Buren","offset":2009},{"uri":"Kinderhook%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Kinderhook, New York","offset":2071},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":2093},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":2184},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":2324},{"uri":"Free_Soil_Party","surface_form":"Free Soil Party","offset":2389},{"uri":"James_Monroe","surface_form":"James Monroe","offset":2488},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":2530}]}
