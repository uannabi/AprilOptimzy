{"id":45219,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe","text":"Many of these countries were members of the Western European Union. Many, such as Norway, are also in Northern Europe or in Central Europe or Southern Europe.\nToday, the term \"Western Europe\" has to do with geography and with economics. The concept is commonly associated with liberal democracy, socialism and also with the European Union, though that also has some countries of Eastern Europe.\nMost of the countries in the region share Western culture, and many have economic, and political ties with countries in North and South America and Oceania.\nIn addition, Scandinavia (in Northern Europe) is commonly associated with social democracy and remains fairly neutral throughout international disputes. The Iberian Peninsula, the most western part of Europe is similarly closely linked to the Americas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Western_European_Union","surface_form":"Western European Union","offset":44},{"uri":"Northern_Europe","surface_form":"Northern Europe","offset":102},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":124},{"uri":"Southern_Europe","surface_form":"Southern Europe","offset":142},{"uri":"Liberal_democracy","surface_form":"liberal democracy","offset":277},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialism","offset":296},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":324},{"uri":"Western_culture","surface_form":"Western culture","offset":437},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North","offset":515},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":525},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":543},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":565},{"uri":"Social_democracy","surface_form":"social democracy","offset":626},{"uri":"Neutral","surface_form":"neutral","offset":662},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":709},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":795}]}
