{"id":452284,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCID","text":"An ORCID is a code to identify someone who writes academic articles. ORCID stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID. Each person can have their own ORCID. ORCIDs make it easy to know which articles someone has written, even if they change their name. They also helps tell who has written which articles, if there is more than one writer with the same name. ORCID was started on 16 October 2012.\nORCIDs usually have four groups of four numbers. An example of a person with an ORCID is John Wilbanks. His ORCID is https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385. That is also the web address of the page about him, on the ORCID website. His ORCID can also be written as \"ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385\". Sometimes an ORCID has an \"X\" instead of a number at the end. An example of this is Nick Jennings's ORCID. His is https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X. The final number (or \"X\") is a check digit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Wilbanks","surface_form":"John Wilbanks","offset":489},{"uri":"Nick_Jennings_(computer_scientist)","surface_form":"Nick Jennings","offset":777},{"uri":"Check_digit","surface_form":"check digit","offset":877}]}
