{"id":452328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test","text":"=\"preserve\">Chi-squared test (or formula_1 test) is a statistical hypothesis test. It usually tests the hypothesis that \"the experimental data does not differ from untreated data\". That is a null hypothesis. The distribution of the test statistic is a chi-squared distribution when the null hypothesis is true.\nThe test results are regarded as 'significant' if there is only one chance in 20 that the result could be got by chance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistical_hypothesis_test","surface_form":"statistical hypothesis test","offset":54},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":104},{"uri":"Null_hypothesis","surface_form":"null hypothesis","offset":191},{"uri":"Chi-squared_distribution","surface_form":"chi-squared distribution","offset":252}]}
