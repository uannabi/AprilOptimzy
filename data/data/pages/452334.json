{"id":452334,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_de_Moivre","text":"Abraham de Moivre was a French mathematician. He is known for his works on probability theory. He also did a lot of research in trigonometry.De Moivre's formula connects complex numbers and trigonometry. As he was a Huguenot, he was forced to emigrate to England. He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmund Halley, and James Stirling. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux.\nDe Moivre wrote a book on probability theory, \"The Doctrine of Chances\", said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered Binet's formula, the closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers linking the \"n\"th power of the golden ratio \"\u03C6\" to the \"n\"th Fibonacci number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":31},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":75},{"uri":"Trigonometry","surface_form":"trigonometry","offset":128},{"uri":"De_Moivre%27s_formula","surface_form":"De Moivre's formula","offset":141},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":170},{"uri":"Huguenot","surface_form":"Huguenot","offset":216},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":255},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":283},{"uri":"Edmund_Halley","surface_form":"Edmund Halley","offset":297},{"uri":"James_Stirling_(mathematician)","surface_form":"James Stirling","offset":316},{"uri":"Huguenot","surface_form":"Huguenot","offset":349},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":368},{"uri":"Pierre_des_Maizeaux","surface_form":"Pierre des Maizeaux","offset":425},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":472},{"uri":"The_Doctrine_of_Chances","surface_form":"The Doctrine of Chances","offset":493},{"uri":"Binet%27s_formula","surface_form":"Binet's formula","offset":584},{"uri":"Closed-form_expression","surface_form":"closed-form","offset":605},{"uri":"Fibonacci_numbers","surface_form":"Fibonacci numbers","offset":632},{"uri":"Golden_ratio","surface_form":"golden ratio","offset":681}]}
