{"id":452359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viverravidae","text":"The Viverravidae are an extinct family of early mammalian carnivores. They are in the superfamily Miacoidea, and lived from the early Palaeocene to the Eocene. They first appeared in the Paleocene of North America about 60 million years ago.\nViverravidae is a monophyletic family. In viverravids, the number of molars is reduced to two and the skull is long.\nThey are probably not related to any living carnivorans. The viverravids were previously thought to be the earliest carnivorans. A recent study of their skull morphology puts them outside the order Carnivora.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":32},{"uri":"Carnivores","surface_form":"carnivores","offset":58},{"uri":"Miacoidea","surface_form":"Miacoidea","offset":98},{"uri":"Palaeocene","surface_form":"Palaeocene","offset":134},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":152},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":200},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":260},{"uri":"Molar","surface_form":"molars","offset":311},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":344},{"uri":"Morphology_(biology)","surface_form":"morphology","offset":518},{"uri":"Carnivora","surface_form":"Carnivora","offset":557}]}
