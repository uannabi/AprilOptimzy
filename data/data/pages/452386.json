{"id":452386,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Summits","text":"=\"preserve\">The Seven Summits are the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. The list is often listed as Mount Everest, Aconcagua, Puncak Jaya, Mount Elbrus, Mount Vinson, Kilimanjaro, and Mount McKinley.\nThe Seven Summits are composed of each of the highest mountain peaks of each of the seven continents. Different lists include slight variations, but generally the same core is maintained. \"The seven summits depend on the definition used for a continent\". In particular the position of the border of that continent is important. This results in variations in the list.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":46},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":77},{"uri":"Mount_Everest","surface_form":"Mount Everest","offset":117},{"uri":"Aconcagua","surface_form":"Aconcagua","offset":132},{"uri":"Puncak_Jaya","surface_form":"Puncak Jaya","offset":143},{"uri":"Mount_Elbrus","surface_form":"Mount Elbrus","offset":156},{"uri":"Mount_Vinson","surface_form":"Mount Vinson","offset":170},{"uri":"Kilimanjaro","surface_form":"Kilimanjaro","offset":184},{"uri":"Mount_McKinley","surface_form":"Mount McKinley","offset":201}]}
