{"id":452396,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplituhedron","text":"An amplituhedron is a geometric shape that makes it easier to calculate particle interactions in quantum field theories.\nCurrently, the limits of the \"N\"\u00A0=\u00A04 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory, which is used to calculate the amplituhedron, cause it to be a toy theory. Therefore, the application of the amplituhedron is limited in the real world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometric","surface_form":"geometric","offset":22}]}
