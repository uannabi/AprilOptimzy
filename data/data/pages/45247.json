This is usually done as a group. It is done to keep the spirit of a sports team up.\nHistory.\nThis sport is originally from the United States. It was first seen in the beginning of the 1900s. It was, and is still used to support a local sports group (for example football).\nBecause of the athletic ability often needed in cheerleading, many people think cheerleading is a sport. Cheerleaders perform routines that include dancing, tumbling, cheering, stunting and jumping. Cheerleading teams can compete in competitions against other cheer teams as well as perform for different sporting events.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cheer","surface_form":"cheer","offset":58},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":69},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competition","offset":95},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":235},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":370},{"uri":"Physical_fitness","surface_form":"athletic","offset":396},{"uri":"Routine","surface_form":"routine","offset":507},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dancing","offset":529},{"uri":"Tumbling","surface_form":"tumbling","offset":538},{"uri":"Stunt","surface_form":"stunt","offset":558},{"uri":"Jump","surface_form":"jump","offset":571}]}
