{"id":452822,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawise_Giant","text":"\"Seawise Giant\" (known later as the Happy Giant, Jahre Viking, Knock Nevis, Oppama, and Mont) was a ULCC supertanker. It was the longest ship ever built and had the greatest deadweight tonnage that has ever been recorded. When it was heavily loaded, the ship had a displacement of 657,019 tonnes (646,642 long tons; 724,239 short tons) and had a draft of 24.6 m (81 ft). Due to it's size and lack of maneuverability, it was not able to move through the English Channel, Suez Canal or the Panama Canal.\nThe ship was built in 1979 by Sumitomo Heavy Industries at the Oppama shipyard in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan. The ship was sunk during the Iran\u2013Iraq War but was salvaged, restored and put back into service. The ship sailed its final journey in December 2009 after being sold to Indian ship breakers. It was then intentionally beached in Alang, Gujarat, India and was demolished.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oil_tanker","surface_form":"supertanker","offset":105},{"uri":"Deadweight_tonnage","surface_form":"deadweight tonnage","offset":174},{"uri":"Displacement_(ship)","surface_form":"displacement","offset":265},{"uri":"Draft_(hull)","surface_form":"draft","offset":346},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":453},{"uri":"Suez_Canal","surface_form":"Suez Canal","offset":470},{"uri":"Panama_Canal","surface_form":"Panama Canal","offset":488},{"uri":"Sumitomo_Heavy_Industries","surface_form":"Sumitomo Heavy Industries","offset":532},{"uri":"Yokosuka%2C_Kanagawa","surface_form":"Yokosuka, Kanagawa","offset":584},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":604},{"uri":"Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War","surface_form":"Iran\u2013Iraq War","offset":640},{"uri":"Marine_salvage","surface_form":"salvaged","offset":662},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"Indian","offset":779},{"uri":"Ship_breaking","surface_form":"ship breakers","offset":786},{"uri":"Alang","surface_form":"Alang","offset":838},{"uri":"Gujarat","surface_form":"Gujarat","offset":845},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":854}]}
