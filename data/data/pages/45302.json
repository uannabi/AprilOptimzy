{"id":45302,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicium","text":"Copernicium (former Ununbium) is a chemical element in the Periodic Table. It is also named eka-mercury. It has the symbol Cn. It has the atomic number 112. It is a transuranium element.\nThe element is named in honor of Nicolaus Copernicus.\nUsing periodic trends, people think that it will be a liquid metal. It is likely to be more volatile than mercury.\nHistory.\nCopernicium was first made on February 9, 1996 at the Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. Copernicium was made by nuclear fusion of a zinc atom with a lead atom. The zinc nuclei was bombarded on to a lead target in a machine named a heavy ion accelerator.\nThe element was made in 2000 and 2004 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia.\nIn May 2006 in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research checked that it had been made using a different method. They identified the last atoms that were made from radioactive decay of ununbium.\nIn February 2010 IUPAC officially approved the name copernicium and symbol Cn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":35},{"uri":"Periodic_Table","surface_form":"Periodic Table","offset":59},{"uri":"Mendeleev%27s_predicted_elements","surface_form":"eka","offset":92},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":138},{"uri":"Transuranium_element","surface_form":"transuranium element","offset":165},{"uri":"Nicolaus_Copernicus","surface_form":"Nicolaus Copernicus","offset":220},{"uri":"Periodic_trend","surface_form":"periodic trend","offset":247},{"uri":"Volatility","surface_form":"volatile","offset":333},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":347},{"uri":"Discovery_of_the_chemical_elements","surface_form":"first made","offset":381},{"uri":"February_9","surface_form":"February 9","offset":395},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":407},{"uri":"Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_Schwerionenforschung","surface_form":"Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Schwerionenforschung","offset":419},{"uri":"Darmstadt","surface_form":"Darmstadt","offset":466},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":477},{"uri":"Nuclear_fusion","surface_form":"nuclear fusion","offset":510},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":530},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":547},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":562},{"uri":"Bombardment","surface_form":"bombarded","offset":578},{"uri":"Target","surface_form":"target","offset":601},{"uri":"Ion_accelerator","surface_form":"ion accelerator","offset":635},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":676},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":685},{"uri":"Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","surface_form":"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research","offset":697},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":737},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":752},{"uri":"Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","surface_form":"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research","offset":764},{"uri":"Radioactive_decay","surface_form":"radioactive decay","offset":908},{"uri":"2010","surface_form":"2010","offset":951}]}
