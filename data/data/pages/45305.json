{"id":45305,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn","text":"The Tropic of Capricorn, or Southern tropic, is one of the five major circles of latitude of a map of the Earth. It is 23\u00B0 26\u2032 22\u2033 south of the Equator.\nIt marks the most southerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead. This happens at the December solstice, when the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun to its maximum extent.\nHistory.\nThe Tropic of Capricorn is named because about 2000 years ago the sun was entering the constellation Capricornus on the December solstice. Now the sun appears in the constellation Sagittarius during the December solstice. The change is due to precession of the equinoxes. The word \"tropic\" comes from the Greek tropos, meaning \"turn\". This refers to the fact that the sun appears to \"turn back\" at the solstices.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circle_of_latitude","surface_form":"circles of latitude","offset":70},{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":95},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":106},{"uri":"Degree_(angle)","surface_form":"\u00B0","offset":121},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"Equator","offset":144},{"uri":"Solstice","surface_form":"solstice","offset":266},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":450},{"uri":"Capricornus","surface_form":"Capricornus","offset":464},{"uri":"Sagittarius_(constellation)","surface_form":"Sagittarius","offset":543},{"uri":"Precession_of_the_equinoxes","surface_form":"precession of the equinoxes","offset":606}]}
