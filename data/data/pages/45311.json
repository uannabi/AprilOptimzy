{"id":45311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England","text":"Edward III (13 November 1312\u201321 June 1377) was a King of England. He ruled for 50 years.\nHe made England the strongest military power in Europe.\nEdward was crowned when he was fourteen years old, after his father was forced to abdicate. After his victory against the Scots, he declared himself heir to the French throne in 1337, and so started the Hundred Years' War. The war went very well for England; the victories of Cr\u00E9cy and Poitiers led up to the Treaty of Br\u00E9tigny, by which he gained a lot of territory. When he became older, he was much less active, mostly a result of his bad health. He died of a stroke in 1377, aged 64.\nEdward also established the Order of the Garter, and developed legislature and government. However, during his reign there was the Black Death.\nEdward and his wife, Philippa of Hainault, had many children and, as they traveled, the children were generally known by where they were born (though the oldest son, Edward \"of Woodstock,\" became known to later generations as Edward, the Black Prince). Prince Edward died before his father Edward III, and his older son, Edward \"of Angouleme,\" had died a child, so younger son Richard \"of Bordeaux\" succeeded Edward III as Richard II of England before being deposed by his cousin Henry IV of England, whose father, John \"of Gaunt\", had married the heiress of Lancaster. His family, the House of Lancaster, fought the Wars of the Roses with the House of York descended from the daughter of Edward III's son Lionel \"of Antwerp\" (who was older than John) over who was the rightful king.\nIn his own time and for centuries after Edward III was praised a lot, but by Whig historians he was seen as an irresponsible adventurer. This view has turned, and modern historians see what a good king he was.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["royalty"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abdication","surface_form":"abdicate","offset":227},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scots","offset":267},{"uri":"Heir_apparent","surface_form":"heir","offset":294},{"uri":"Hundred_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Hundred Years' War","offset":348},{"uri":"Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy","surface_form":"Cr\u00E9cy","offset":421},{"uri":"Battle_of_Poitiers_(1356)","surface_form":"Poitiers","offset":431},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Br%C3%A9tigny","surface_form":"Treaty of Br\u00E9tigny","offset":454},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Garter","surface_form":"Order of the Garter","offset":661},{"uri":"Black_Death","surface_form":"Black Death","offset":764},{"uri":"Philippa_of_Hainault","surface_form":"Philippa of Hainault","offset":798},{"uri":"Edward%2C_the_Black_Prince","surface_form":"Edward, the Black Prince","offset":1003},{"uri":"Richard_II_of_England","surface_form":"Richard II of England","offset":1200},{"uri":"Henry_IV_of_England","surface_form":"Henry IV of England","offset":1257},{"uri":"John_of_Gaunt%2C_1st_Duke_of_Lancaster","surface_form":"John \"of Gaunt\"","offset":1292},{"uri":"Wars_of_the_Roses","surface_form":"Wars of the Roses","offset":1394},{"uri":"Lionel_of_Antwerp%2C_1st_Duke_of_Clarence","surface_form":"Lionel \"of Antwerp\"","offset":1483},{"uri":"Whig_history","surface_form":"Whig historians","offset":1638},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":1731}]}
