The plant is perennial (grows every year) and originally comes from Africa. It was used to make a fabric much like paper. This was called papyrus, and served much the same purpose that paper does today. Its roots were also used as fuels. Also makes rope and sandals too.\nIt is almost extinct along the shores of the river Nile where it was originally cultivated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":76},{"uri":"Sedge","surface_form":"sedge","offset":91},{"uri":"Perennial","surface_form":"perennial","offset":127},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":182},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":229},{"uri":"Papyrus","surface_form":"papyrus","offset":252},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":436}]}
