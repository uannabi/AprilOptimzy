It is also known as Georgia Tech.\nIt focuses primarily on engineering, science and computer science, but also has schools of management, architecture, and liberal arts.\nWhen it opened in 1885, the school's main focus was on practical experience (learning things by doing them); students spent half of their time in class, and half in the shop.\nIt first admitted women in 1952.\nIn 1961, it was the first university in the South to integrate (let people of different races go to school together) without a court order.\nThe school's colors are white and old gold (mustard yellow). Their mascot is Buzz, a Yellow Jacket (a kind of bee-like wasp).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":48},{"uri":"Atlanta%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Atlanta","offset":93},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":102},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":169},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":182},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":194},{"uri":"Management","surface_form":"management","offset":236},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":248},{"uri":"Liberal_arts","surface_form":"liberal arts","offset":266},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"South","offset":532},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":652},{"uri":"Mustard","surface_form":"mustard","offset":672},{"uri":"Yellow_Jacket","surface_form":"Yellow Jacket","offset":713}]}
