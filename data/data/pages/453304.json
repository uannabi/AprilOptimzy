{"id":453304,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lady tasting tea is the name of a famous randomized experiment designed by Ronald Fisher in 1935. The experiment is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a null hypothesis. Fisher's description is less than ten pages long and is notable for its simplicity and completeness regarding terminology, calculations and design of the experiment. The example is loosely based on an event in Fisher's life. The lady in question was Muriel Bristol, and the test used was Fisher's exact test.\nThe experiment.\nThe lady in question claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance.\nIf and only if the Lady properly categorized all eight cups was Fisher willing to reject the null hypothesis \u2013 effectively acknowledging the Lady's ability at a 1.4% significance level (but without quantifying her ability). Fisher later discussed the benefits of more trials and repeated tests.\nDavid Salsburg reports that a colleague of Fisher, H. Fairfield Smith, revealed that in the test, the woman got all eight cups correct. The chance of someone who just guesses getting all correct, assuming she guesses that four had the tea put in first and four the milk, would be only 1 in 70 (the combinations of 8 taken 4 at a time).\nIn popular science, Salsburg published a book entitled \"The Lady Tasting Tea\", which describes Fisher's experiment and ideas on randomization. Deb Basu wrote that \"the famous case of the 'lady tasting tea'\" was \"one of the two supporting pillars... of the randomization analysis of experimental data\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":65},{"uri":"Ronald_Fisher","surface_form":"Ronald Fisher","offset":88},{"uri":"Null_hypothesis","surface_form":"null hypothesis","offset":177},{"uri":"Muriel_Bristol","surface_form":"Muriel Bristol","offset":444},{"uri":"Fisher%27s_exact_test","surface_form":"Fisher's exact test","offset":482},{"uri":"David_Salsburg","surface_form":"David Salsburg","offset":1103},{"uri":"H._Fairfield_Smith","surface_form":"H.
