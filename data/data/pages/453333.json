{"id":453333,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_staining","text":"Gram staining (or Gram's method) is a way of classifying bacteria into two large groups: gram-positive and gram-negative. The name comes from its inventor, Hans Christian Gram.\nGram's method stains bacteria according to the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls. First, a violet dye is put on the bacteria. This dye stains peptidoglycan, a thick layer that is only found in gram-positive bacteria. After the first stain, another stain (usually safranin or fuchsin) gives all gram-negative bacteria a red or pink colour.\nThe Gram stain is almost always the first step in the identification of a bacterial organism. However, not all bacteria can be classified by this technique. Bacteria for which the method does not work are called 'gram-variable' or 'gram-indeterminate'.\nGram developed the technique working with another scientist, Carl Friedl\u00E4nder in a hospital in Berlin. However, Gram first used the test to make bacteria in the lungs easier to see. He published his finished method in 1884.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":57},{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"gram-positive","offset":89},{"uri":"Gram-negative","surface_form":"gram-negative","offset":107},{"uri":"Cell_wall","surface_form":"cell wall","offset":266},{"uri":"Peptidoglycan","surface_form":"peptidoglycan","offset":338},{"uri":"Safranin","surface_form":"safranin","offset":459},{"uri":"Fuchsin","surface_form":"fuchsin","offset":471},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":883},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":949}]}
