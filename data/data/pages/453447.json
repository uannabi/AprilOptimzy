{"id":453447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_and_Loeb","text":"Leopold and Loeb were Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. (November 19, 1904\u00A0\u2013 August 29, 1971) and Richard Albert Loeb (June 11, 1905\u00A0\u2013 January 28, 1936).\nThey were two wealthy University of Chicago law students who kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Robert \"Bobby\" Franks in 1924 in Chicago.\nThe duo was motivated to murder Franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime.\nOnce arrested, Leopold and Loeb hired Clarence Darrow as counsel for the defense. Darrow\u2019s summation in their trial criticized capital punishment as retribution, rather than rehabilitation. Leopold and Loeb were sentenced to life imprisonment. Loeb was killed by a fellow prisoner in 1936; Leopold was released on parole in 1958.\nThe Leopold and Loeb crime has been the inspiration for several works in film, theatre, and fiction, such as the 1929 play \"Rope\" by Patrick Hamilton, and Alfred Hitchcock's take on the play in the 1948 film of the same name. Later movies such as \"Compulsion\" and \"Swoon\" were more accurate portrayals of the Leopold and Loeb case.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["criminal"],"annotations":[{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":174},{"uri":"Perfect_crime","surface_form":"perfect crime","offset":357},{"uri":"Clarence_Darrow","surface_form":"Clarence Darrow","offset":410},{"uri":"Capital_punishment","surface_form":"capital punishment","offset":499},{"uri":"Retributive_justice","surface_form":"retribution","offset":521},{"uri":"Transformative_justice","surface_form":"rehabilitation","offset":546},{"uri":"Life_imprisonment","surface_form":"life imprisonment","offset":597},{"uri":"Rope_(play)","surface_form":"Rope","offset":826},{"uri":"Patrick_Hamilton_(writer)","surface_form":"Patrick Hamilton","offset":835},{"uri":"Alfred_Hitchcock","surface_form":"Alfred Hitchcock","offset":857},{"uri":"Rope_(film)","surface_form":"film of the same name","offset":905}]}
