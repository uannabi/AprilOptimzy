It is related to languages such as Indonesian, Javanese and Maori. That means that Malagasy is related to languages spoken in Indonesia. This is probably because immigrants from Indonesia came to Madagascar until A.D. 1400. It is the only Austronesian language spoken in Africa.\nWriting.\nMalagasy is written using the English alphabet, but without c, q, u, w and x. No accents or other diacritical marks are used. It was invented by David Jones as a replacement for Sorabe (a type of Arabic script). Most letters have their IPA values. However, y and i are both pronounced like /i/ and h is often silent. A few consonant digraphs (tr, dr, ts) are used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indonesian_language","surface_form":"Indonesian","offset":134},{"uri":"Javanese_language","surface_form":"Javanese","offset":146},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_language","surface_form":"Maori","offset":159}]}
