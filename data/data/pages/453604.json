{"id":453604,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory","text":"r/K selection theory describes the way a species controls its number of offspring.\nr-selection species produce many offspring. K-selected species focus on a few. Neither method is in itself superior, and they may occur in the same habitat; e.g., rodents (r-selection) and elephants (K-selection).\nThe theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but several studies criticized it. The study of life histories has replaced the r/K selection paradigm.\nThe terminology of r/K-selection was coined by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, based on their work on island biogeography. Study of the evolution of life history strategies actually has a longer history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":41},{"uri":"Offspring","surface_form":"offspring","offset":72},{"uri":"Rodents","surface_form":"rodents","offset":246},{"uri":"Elephants","surface_form":"elephants","offset":272},{"uri":"E.O._Wilson","surface_form":"E.O.
