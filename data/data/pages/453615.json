When Satrapi was 19, she moved back to Iran to study decorative arts at the Tehran School of Fine Arts. The change from the western world to Iran was difficult for her. In 1994, Satrapi moved to Strasbourg, France to study art for 3 years. She now lives in Paris, France.\nBeliefs.\nSatrapi thinks countries should not spend money on weapons. She thinks they should spend money for kids to go to school in different countries. She thinks that studying in different countries helps people understand each other better.\nIn RandomHouse.com, Satrapi said, \"I believe there are ways to solve the world's problems. Instead of putting all this money to create arms, I think countries should invest in scholarships for kids to study abroad [other countries]. Perhaps they could become good and knowledgeable professors in their own countries. You need time for that kind of change, though.\"\nWriting and the War.\nIran's Islamic Revolution against the Shah, the country\u2019s dictator, started in 1979.
