{"id":45362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast","text":"Toast is bread which has been grilled until hot and crispy. A toaster, grill or open fire is used. Toasted bread is both darker in color and crunchier than normal bread. Toast can be eaten with a range of condiments spread on the surface, such as butter, jam, honey, and cheese to make cheese on toast, though these are optional as some people prefer their toast without condiments (dry toast).\nToast can also be used to make 'toasties', where a filling is compressed and heated between two slices of buttered bread in a toastie maker. Popular fillings include cheese, jam, peanut butter and chocolate spread.\nPreparation.\nBefore the invention of modern cooking appliances such as toasters and grills, bread has been produced in ovens for millennia. Toast can be made in the same oven.\nMany brands of sliced bread are available, some specifically marketing their suitability for toasting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":9},{"uri":"Toaster","surface_form":"toaster","offset":62},{"uri":"Grill","surface_form":"grill","offset":71},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":131},{"uri":"Condiment","surface_form":"condiment","offset":205},{"uri":"Butter","surface_form":"butter","offset":247},{"uri":"Jam","surface_form":"jam","offset":255},{"uri":"Honey","surface_form":"honey","offset":260},{"uri":"Cheese_on_toast","surface_form":"cheese on toast","offset":286},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":561},{"uri":"Jam","surface_form":"jam","offset":569},{"uri":"Peanut_butter","surface_form":"peanut butter","offset":574},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":592},{"uri":"Appliance","surface_form":"appliance","offset":662},{"uri":"Millenium","surface_form":"millennia","offset":739}]}
