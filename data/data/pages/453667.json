{"id":453667,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder","text":"Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental disorder. It causes irritable and angry behaviour of at least 6 months, noticeable in communication with other people. Unlike those with conduct disorder, though, most people with ODD do not usually get aggressive towards other people or animals, steal or cause destruction. People with ODD, however, do argue and deliberately, often cause trouble.\nSymptoms.\nAbout 10.2% of people have or have had ODD (11.2% of males and 9.2% of females). In many cases this condition worsens into conduct disorder, which often worsens into antisocial personality disorder. This is more likely in boys than girls, and more likely if the person also has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. ODD typically begins in childhood. It is the most common mental disorder in children. It is unusual in adults, because the affected person usually either recovers or develops ASPD.\nODD is more common in family members of people who have ODD, CD or ASPD. It is more common in poor urban areas.\nMost people who have ODD also have other mental disorders, most often ADHD. Many children who have ODD have problems with alcohol and drugs in their adolescence and adulthood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mental_disorder","surface_form":"mental disorder","offset":35},{"uri":"Conduct_disorder","surface_form":"conduct disorder","offset":179},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":280},{"uri":"Antisocial_personality_disorder","surface_form":"antisocial personality disorder","offset":567},{"uri":"Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","surface_form":"attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","offset":679}]}
