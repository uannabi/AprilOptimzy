{"id":453705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal_III","text":"\"Twisted Metal III\" (also known by its former name \"Twisted Metal 3\") is a vehicular combat video game that was both published and developed by 989 Studios. It is the third game in the \"Twisted Metal\" series. It was only released on the PlayStation and was only released in North America. The game was released on October 31, 1998 in North America for PlayStation. It was rereleased in 1999 as part of the Sony Greatest Hits lineup.\nReception.\nIGN rated the game a 4 out of 10 and said that \"with the exception of the four-player combat and Rob Zombie's hard-rock soundtrack -- the two great things about the game -- Twisted Metal 3 is a middle-of-the-road game that unfortunately doesn't do anything more than the first two games. In fact, it's just plain old hat.\"\nGameSpot's Joe Fielder said that the game's soundtrack by Rob Zombie and Pitchshifter was \"fitting\" but he criticized the \"lackluster\" level design and \"strange\" physics engine. He advised readers to check out Activision's \"Vigilante 8\" or GT Interactive's ' instead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicular_combat_game","surface_form":"vehicular combat","offset":75},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":92},{"uri":"Video_game_publisher","surface_form":"published","offset":117},{"uri":"Video_game_developer","surface_form":"developed","offset":131},{"uri":"989_Studios","surface_form":"989 Studios","offset":144},{"uri":"Twisted_Metal","surface_form":"Twisted Metal","offset":186},{"uri":"PlayStation","surface_form":"PlayStation","offset":237},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":334},{"uri":"List_of_Sony_Greatest_Hits_games","surface_form":"Sony Greatest Hits","offset":406},{"uri":"IGN","surface_form":"IGN","offset":444},{"uri":"GameSpot","surface_form":"GameSpot","offset":767},{"uri":"Rob_Zombie","surface_form":"Rob Zombie","offset":825},{"uri":"Pitchshifter","surface_form":"Pitchshifter","offset":840},{"uri":"Activision","surface_form":"Activision","offset":977},{"uri":"Vigilante_8","surface_form":"Vigilante 8","offset":991},{"uri":"GT_Interactive_Software","surface_form":"GT Interactive","offset":1007}]}
