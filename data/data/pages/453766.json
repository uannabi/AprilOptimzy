It was called an \"airborne\" division because, as a paratrooper unit, it used airplanes to go into battle. It is most famous its defense of Bastogne at the Battle of the Bulge. The division later fought in the Vietnam War, including the Battle of Hamburger Hill. It also fought in the Gulf War, War in Afghanistan, and War in Iraq.\nHistory.\nThe 101st Division was organized 2 November 1918 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. World War I ended 9 days later. The unit was disbanded on 11 December 1918.\nThe unit was made active again on 10 September 1921, at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They were assigned to the United States Army Reserve. At this time the \"Screaming Eagle\" nickname became associated with the division. They assumed several traditions as a successor to the volunteer regiments of the American Civil War.
