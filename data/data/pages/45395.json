{"id":45395,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi","text":"=\"preserve\">The Mahdi or Mehdi ('the rightly-guided one') is Islam's messiah or savior. It is said that he and the Prophet Jesus will change the world for the better, bringing God in all hearts, before Yaum al-Qiyamah (\"Day of the Resurrection\").\nIn particular, the Sudanese tribal leader Muhammed Ahmed proclaimed himself as the Mahdi, appointed by Allah to free his country. He defeated the forces of the Khedive of Egypt and the British, only to die suddenly six months later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"Prophet","offset":115},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":123},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"world","offset":145},{"uri":"Yaum_al-Qiyamah","surface_form":"Yaum al-Qiyamah","offset":202},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":266},{"uri":"Muhammed_Ahmed","surface_form":"Muhammed Ahmed","offset":289},{"uri":"Allah","surface_form":"Allah","offset":350},{"uri":"Khedive","surface_form":"Khedive","offset":407},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":418}]}
