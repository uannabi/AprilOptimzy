He was known for his unusually high contralto voice. This is because he had Kallmann's syndrome, a very rare genetic condition. The condition prevented him from reaching puberty, leaving him with a high, undeveloped voice.\nScott died in Las Vegas, Nevada from cardiac arrest, aged 88.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":112},{"uri":"Contralto","surface_form":"contralto","offset":161},{"uri":"Kallmann_syndrome","surface_form":"Kallmann's syndrome","offset":201},{"uri":"Genetic_disorder","surface_form":"genetic condition","offset":234},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":295},{"uri":"Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada","surface_form":"Las Vegas, Nevada","offset":362},{"uri":"Cardiac_arrest","surface_form":"cardiac arrest","offset":385}]}
