{"id":4541,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_change","text":"e=\"preserve\">A chemical change (chemical reaction) is a change of materials into other, new materials with different properties, and one or new substances are formed. Burning of wood is a chemical change as new substances which cannot be changed back (e.g. carbon dioxide) are formed. For example, if wood is burned in a fireplace, there is not wood anymore but ash. Other examples include burning of a candle, rusting of iron, baking a cake, etc. Special details that describe how a chemical change takes place are called chemical properties.\nCompare: Physical change - The opposite of a chemical change is a physical change. Physical changes are a change in which no new substances are formed, and the substance which is changed is the same. For instance, if a stick of wood is broken, there is still a stick of wood; it is just broken.\nMore examples include changes of shape, changes of states, passing electricity through a copper wire, breaking of wood, shattering of glass, pouring of water, etc. Special details which do not change in a substance without new substances being formed are called physical properties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Materials","surface_form":"materials","offset":92},{"uri":"Properties","surface_form":"properties","offset":117},{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":144},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":178},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":257},{"uri":"Candle","surface_form":"candle","offset":403},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":422},{"uri":"Physical_change","surface_form":"Physical change","offset":553},{"uri":"Opposite","surface_form":"opposite","offset":575}]}
