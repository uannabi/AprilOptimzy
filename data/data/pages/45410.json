{"id":45410,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast","text":"The mast of a sailing ship is a tall vertical pole which supports the sails. Larger ships have several masts, with the size depending on the style of ship.\nUntil the 20th century, a ship's masts would be wooden spars, originally constructed from a single straight tree trunk. As ship sizes increased, taller masts were constructed by lashing up to three spars together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":22},{"uri":"Sail","surface_form":"sail","offset":70},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":84},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":166},{"uri":"Spar","surface_form":"spar","offset":211},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree trunk","offset":264}]}
