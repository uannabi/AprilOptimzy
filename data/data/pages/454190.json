{"id":454190,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence","text":"In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered set of mathematical objects (most notably a list of numbers). In some cases, the sequence tends towards a limit, in which case the limit is denoted using the symbol formula_1 (as in formula_1), and the sequence is said to be convergent, otherwise it is divergent.\nIn a convergent sequence, the absolute difference between the value of the current term and the limit, formula_1, will decrease towards 0, as the sequence progresses.\nFormal Definition.\nIn other words, for every measure of distance formula_1, we can find an infinite number of terms of the sequence that are closer than formula_1 to the limit. We say that the sequence formula_1 converges to or tends to the limit formula_1, which we write as formula_1 or formula_1. The limit can be also shown to be unique.\nIf a sequence converges to a limit, then it is convergent; otherwise it is divergent.\nHistory.\nThe Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea is famous for formulating paradoxes that involve limiting processes.\nLeucippus, Democritus, Antiphon, Eudoxus and Archimedes developed the method of exhaustion, which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a geometric series.\nNewton dealt with series in his works on \"Analysis with infinite series\" (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), \"Method of fluxions and infinite series\" (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and \"Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum\" (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his \"Optiks\"). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of (\"x\"+\"o\")\"n\", which he then linearizes by \"taking the limits\" as \"o\" tends to 0.\nIn the 18th century, mathematicians like Euler succeeded in summing some \"divergent\" series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, Lagrange in his \"Th\u00E9orie des fonctions analytiques\" (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. Gauss in his etude of hypergeometric series (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit.\nThe modern definition of a limit (for any \u03B5 there exists an index \"N\" so that...) was given by Bernhard Bolzano (\"Der binomische Lehrsatz\", Prague 1816, little noticed at the time), and by Karl Weierstra\u00DF in the 1870s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":18},{"uri":"Absolute_value","surface_form":"absolute","offset":335},{"uri":"Zeno_of_Elea","surface_form":"Zeno of Elea","offset":931},{"uri":"Zeno%27s_paradoxes","surface_form":"paradoxes that involve limiting processes","offset":970},{"uri":"Leucippus","surface_form":"Leucippus","offset":1013},{"uri":"Democritus","surface_form":"Democritus","offset":1024},{"uri":"Antiphon_(person)","surface_form":"Antiphon","offset":1036},{"uri":"Eudoxus_of_Cnidus","surface_form":"Eudoxus","offset":1046},{"uri":"Archimedes","surface_form":"Archimedes","offset":1058},{"uri":"Method_of_exhaustion","surface_form":"method of exhaustion","offset":1083},{"uri":"Geometric_series","surface_form":"geometric series","offset":1242},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Newton","offset":1260},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":1808},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Euler","offset":1828},{"uri":"Joseph_Louis_Lagrange","surface_form":"Lagrange","offset":2022},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Gauss","offset":2155},{"uri":"Hypergeometric_series","surface_form":"hypergeometric series","offset":2177},{"uri":"Bernhard_Bolzano","surface_form":"Bernhard Bolzano","offset":2398},{"uri":"Karl_Weierstra%C3%9F","surface_form":"Karl Weierstra\u00DF","offset":2492}]}
