The Orpheum is a part of the Vancouver Civic Theatres group of live performance venues along with the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and Vancouver Playhouse. It was opened on November 7, 1927 as a vaudeville house although they had their first show the day before. When it opened in 1927, The Orpheum was the biggest theatre in Canada, had three thousand seats and cost $1.25 million to build. When vaudeville was slowing down from its popularity, the Orpheum found new owners in Famous Players and became mainly a movie house but hosted live events every now and then.\nIn 1973, Famous Players wanted to turn the place into a multiplex because of economic reasons. There was a \"Save the Orpheum\" public protest that was launched, which Jack Benny flew in to help with. The Orpheum was then saved.\nIt is the home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The Orpheum was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on November 15, 1979.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":17},{"uri":"Music_venue","surface_form":"music venue","offset":29},{"uri":"Granville_Street","surface_form":"Granville Street","offset":63},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":83},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":94},{"uri":"Queen_Elizabeth_Theatre","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth Theatre","offset":214},{"uri":"Vancouver_Playhouse_(theatre_venue)","surface_form":"Vancouver Playhouse","offset":242},{"uri":"Vaudeville","surface_form":"vaudeville","offset":302},{"uri":"Cineplex_Entertainment","surface_form":"Famous Players","offset":585},{"uri":"Multiplex_(movie_theater)","surface_form":"multiplex","offset":731},{"uri":"Jack_Benny","surface_form":"Jack Benny","offset":841},{"uri":"Vancouver_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"Vancouver Symphony Orchestra","offset":924},{"uri":"National_Historic_Sites_of_Canada","surface_form":"National Historic Site of Canada","offset":983}]}
