{"id":45430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_Of_Pink_Indians","text":"e=\"preserve\">Flux of Pink Indians was political punk band. It was formed in Hertfordshire, England in 1980. Flux of Pink Indians was made up of Colin Latter (vocals), Derek Birkett (bass), Kevin Hunter (guitar) and Martin Wilson (drums). The band was originally called the Epileptics and later changed their name to Epi-X after complaints from the British Epilepsy Association. In 1981, the group signed on with the Crass label. They took on the organization's dedication to anarchist politics and punk abrasion. They issued their debut album \"Neu Smell\" soon after signing. With that album they got an indie hit with \"Johnny Kidd\".\nUpon creating their own label, Spiderleg, Flux of Pink Indians resurfaced in 1982 with the album \"Strive to Survive Causing Least Suffering Possible\". Not surprisingly, their 1983 follow-up \"The Fucking Cunts Treat Us Like Pricks\" was banned by many British retailers. One Manchester indie record store which did carry the record was charged for displaying \"obscene articles for publication for gain.\" A long time off followed before the group - now known as Flux - returned in 1986 with the largely instrumental \"Uncarved Block\". They disbanded in 1987; Derek Birkett later founded the One Little Indian label.\nTheir latest CD came out in 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":38},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk","offset":48},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":53},{"uri":"Hertfordshire%2C_England","surface_form":"Hertfordshire, England","offset":76},{"uri":"1980","surface_form":"1980","offset":102},{"uri":"Colin_Latter","surface_form":"Colin Latter","offset":144},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"vocals","offset":158},{"uri":"Derek_Birkett","surface_form":"Derek Birkett","offset":167},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass","offset":182},{"uri":"Kevin_Hunter","surface_form":"Kevin Hunter","offset":189},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":203},{"uri":"Martin_Wilson","surface_form":"Martin Wilson","offset":215},{"uri":"Drummer","surface_form":"drums","offset":230},{"uri":"Complaint","surface_form":"complaint","offset":328},{"uri":"British_Epilepsy_Association","surface_form":"British Epilepsy Association","offset":348},{"uri":"Recording_label","surface_form":"label","offset":422},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":446},{"uri":"Dedication","surface_form":"dedication","offset":461},{"uri":"Anarchist","surface_form":"anarchist","offset":475},{"uri":"Punk_abrasion","surface_form":"punk abrasion","offset":498},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":537},{"uri":"Independent_music","surface_form":"indie","offset":603},{"uri":"Ban","surface_form":"ban","offset":868},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":883},{"uri":"Retail","surface_form":"retail","offset":891},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":906},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"store","offset":930},{"uri":"Obscene","surface_form":"obscene","offset":991},{"uri":"Publication","surface_form":"publication","offset":1012},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrumental","offset":1133},{"uri":"Founder","surface_form":"founded","offset":1208},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CD","offset":1258}]}
