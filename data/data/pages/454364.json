In 1965, Cobby disappeared. She was taken while waiting at a restaurant with her daughter Mabel, who was the only child out of the four who was not taken from her when they were little. The police were called by the staff who worked at the restaurant. The police were asked to ask May and Mabel to leave the area. Mabel was arrested and May was left at the restaurant.
