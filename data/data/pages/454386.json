At the fair many inventors such as Thomas Edison, Milton S. Hershey, Nikola Tesla, George Ferris, and Marshall Field were there. Many other famous people were there too such as President Grover Cleveland, Mark Twain, Buffalo Bill, Sitting Bull, Scott Joplin, Mayor Carter Harrison, Sr., and Daniel Burnham.\nThe exposition was where many famous inventions were first presented and many modern items such as the Ferris wheel, Quaker Oats, Hershey's, the Frontier thesis was presented, and the United States Mint, in the United States of America, offered its first commemorative coins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World%27s_Fair","surface_form":"World's Fair","offset":152},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":173},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":227},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":338},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":353},{"uri":"St._Louis%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":375},{"uri":"Thomas_Edison","surface_form":"Thomas Edison","offset":496},{"uri":"Milton_S._Hershey","surface_form":"Milton S.
