{"id":454440,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_reel","text":"A fishing reel is a device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and unwinding fishing line.\nModern fishing reels are designed to help in casting for distance and accuracy. Reels also retrieve line, usually with a handle. Fishing reels are traditionally used in the recreational sport of angling. They are also used in the sport of competitive casting. Reels are usually attached to a fishing rod by some means. However specialized reels are made to be mounted directly to the boat gunwales or transoms.\nThe first writing describing a fishing reel is from about 1100 years ago in China. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 AD. By the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising gear-retrieved reels. An American watchmaker and inventor, George W. Snyder, invented the first gear multiplying reel abut 1810.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fishing_rod","surface_form":"fishing rod","offset":41},{"uri":"Fishing_line","surface_form":"fishing line","offset":83},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":122},{"uri":"Casting_(angling)","surface_form":"casting","offset":142},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":154},{"uri":"Accuracy","surface_form":"accuracy","offset":167},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":270},{"uri":"Angling","surface_form":"angling","offset":292},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competitive","offset":336},{"uri":"Casting_(sport)","surface_form":"casting","offset":348},{"uri":"Fishing_rod","surface_form":"fishing rod","offset":389},{"uri":"Gunwale","surface_form":"gunwale","offset":486},{"uri":"Transom_(nautical)","surface_form":"transom","offset":498},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":518},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":584},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":623},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":661},{"uri":"Fishing_tackle","surface_form":"tackle shops","offset":668},{"uri":"Gear","surface_form":"gear","offset":698},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":723},{"uri":"George_W._Snyder","surface_form":"George W.
