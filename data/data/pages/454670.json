{"id":454670,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment","text":"=\"preserve\">In geometry, a line segment is a line between two different endpoints. It is represented by a line above the symbols of the two endpoints (such as formula_1). Unlike a line, a line segment does not extend beyond the endpoints.\nAn example of a line segment is a side of a triangle. If the endpoints are on a curve, like a circle, then the line segment is called a chord.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":15},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":283},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":319},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":333},{"uri":"Chord_(geometry)","surface_form":"chord","offset":375}]}
