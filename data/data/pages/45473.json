{"id":45473,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(boat)","text":"A punt is a flat boat with a broad front. It is designed for use in small rivers or other shallow water. Punting means boating in a punt. The punter pushes a pole against the river bed (the bottom of the river) and this gives the punt a way to move.\nPunts were originally built as cargo boats or platforms. They were for shooting at birds and fishing. In modern times they are mostly used for pleasure trips on the rivers in the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge in England. There are also races at summer regattas on the Thames.\nPunt poles.\nPoles for pleasure punts are normally made of spruce, or aluminium. A normal pole is about 12\u201316 feet (4\u20135 m) long and weighs about 10 lb (5 kg). In Oxford and Cambridge 16 ft long poles are sometimes used.\nThe bottom of the pole has a metal \"shoe\", a rounded lump of metal to protect the end. The shoe is sometimes made in the shape of a swallow tail.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":17},{"uri":"Bow_(ship)","surface_form":"front","offset":35},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":74},{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":281},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":343},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":429},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":449},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":460},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":473},{"uri":"Regattas","surface_form":"regattas","offset":513},{"uri":"Thames","surface_form":"Thames","offset":529},{"uri":"Spruce","surface_form":"spruce","offset":595},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":606},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"lb","offset":684},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kg","offset":690},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":785},{"uri":"Swallow","surface_form":"swallow","offset":888}]}
