{"id":454805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esox","text":"\"Esox\" is a genus of fresh water fish. It is the only living genus in the family Esocidae. The oldest known example of Esox is the fossil \"Esox tiemani\". It dates to about 62 million years ago and was found in Alberta, Canada. Esox are commonly called pike and pickerel. They are found in the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. One species, \"Esox lucius\", the Northern pike, is found in both Europe and North America. Esox are large predatory fish with a long cylindrical body. They have a green color (various shades) with yellow eyes. Pike and pickerel share a forked tail fin and a large pointed head. Their dorsal and anal fins are located far back on their bodies. All species have very sharp teeth.\nForage.\nAll species of Esox are predatory feeders. They eat other fish, small mammals and birds. Pike will eat almost anything that doesn't eat them first.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":12},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":21},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":33},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":74},{"uri":"Esocidae","surface_form":"Esocidae","offset":81},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":175},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":210},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":219},{"uri":"Pike","surface_form":"pike","offset":252},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":293},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":311},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":326},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":337},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":347},{"uri":"Northern_pike","surface_form":"Northern pike","offset":375},{"uri":"Predatory","surface_form":"predatory","offset":448},{"uri":"Cylinder","surface_form":"cylindrical","offset":475},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":487},{"uri":"Green","surface_form":"green","offset":505},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":539},{"uri":"Eyes","surface_form":"eyes","offset":546},{"uri":"Fin","surface_form":"fin","offset":590},{"uri":"Fin","surface_form":"dorsal","offset":626},{"uri":"Fin","surface_form":"anal fins","offset":637},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":798},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":810}]}
