{"id":454947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_876","text":"Gliese 876 is a red dwarf about 15 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. It is the closest star known to be a multiplanetary system. As of 2011, four extrasolar planets have been found orbiting the star.\nIt is the third closest known star to the Sun which has a planetary system, after Epsilon Eridani (10.5 ly) and Gliese 674 (14.8 ly).\nTwo of the middle planets are in the system's habitable zone. However, they are giant planets thought to be like Jupiter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Red_dwarf","surface_form":"red dwarf","offset":16},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":35},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":57},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":70},{"uri":"Aquarius_(constellation)","surface_form":"Aquarius","offset":87},{"uri":"Multiplanetary_system","surface_form":"multiplanetary system","offset":134},{"uri":"Extrasolar_planet","surface_form":"extrasolar planet","offset":174},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":209},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":270},{"uri":"Planetary_system","surface_form":"planetary system","offset":286},{"uri":"Epsilon_Eridani","surface_form":"Epsilon Eridani","offset":310},{"uri":"Gliese_674","surface_form":"Gliese 674","offset":340},{"uri":"Habitable_zone","surface_form":"habitable zone","offset":408},{"uri":"Gas_giant","surface_form":"giant planet","offset":442},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":475}]}
