{"id":454957,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Eridani","text":"e=\"preserve\">Epsilon Eridani (\u03B5 Eri, \u03B5 Eridani) is a star in the southern constellation Eridanus, just south of the celestial equator. It can be seen from most of Earth's surface.\nIt is 10.5 light years (ly) away, and has an apparent magnitude of 3.73. It is the third closest individual star or star system visible to the unaided eye.\nEpsilon Eridani was the closest star known to host a planet until the unconfirmed discovery of Alpha Centauri Bb. Its age is less than a billion years. Because of its youth, Epsilon Eridani has a more active magnetic field than the present-day Sun. Its stellar wind is 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2\u00A0days at the equator. The star is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a lower level of metal elements. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about 5,000\u00A0K, giving it an orange hue.\nIts planet, Epsilon Eridani b, was announced in 2000. The planet orbits in about 7 years. It is about 3.4 astronomical units (AU) away from its star.\nThe system includes two belts of rocky asteroids: one at about 3\u00A0AU and a second at about 20\u00A0AU, whose structure may be maintained by a hypothetical second planet, Epsilon Eridani c. Epsilon Eridani has an extensive outer debris disk of remnant planetesimals left over from the system's formation.\nEpsilon Eridani may be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that share a similar motion through the Milky Way. This suggests they share a common origin in an open star cluster. Its nearest neighbor, the binary star system Luyten 726-8, will have a close encounter with Epsilon Eridani in about 31,500\u00A0years when they will be separated by about 0.93\u00A0ly.\nEpsilon Eridani has been the target of SETI searches. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eridanus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Eridanus","offset":88},{"uri":"Celestial_equator","surface_form":"celestial equator","offset":116},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light year","offset":191},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":225},{"uri":"List_of_nearest_stars","surface_form":"third closest","offset":263},{"uri":"Star_system","surface_form":"star system","offset":296},{"uri":"Alpha_Centauri_Bb","surface_form":"Alpha Centauri Bb","offset":431},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":544},{"uri":"Stellar_wind","surface_form":"stellar wind","offset":589},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":750},{"uri":"Main_sequence","surface_form":"main-sequence star","offset":774},{"uri":"Spectral_class","surface_form":"spectral class","offset":796},{"uri":"Nuclear_fusion","surface_form":"nuclear fusion","offset":869},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":887},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"K","offset":956},{"uri":"Hue","surface_form":"hue","offset":979},{"uri":"Epsilon_Eridani_b","surface_form":"Epsilon Eridani b","offset":996},{"uri":"Astronomical_unit","surface_form":"astronomical unit","offset":1090},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":1173},{"uri":"Debris","surface_form":"debris","offset":1356},{"uri":"Planetesimal","surface_form":"planetesimal","offset":1379},{"uri":"Ursa_Major_Moving_Group","surface_form":"Ursa Major Moving Group","offset":1471},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":1544},{"uri":"Star_cluster","surface_form":"star cluster","offset":1607},{"uri":"Luyten_726-8","surface_form":"Luyten 726-8","offset":1666},{"uri":"SETI","surface_form":"SETI","offset":1836},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":1878},{"uri":"Interstellar_travel","surface_form":"interstellar travel","offset":1946}]}
