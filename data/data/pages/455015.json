It includes the health care dimensions of family planning, preconception, prenatal and postnatal caring.\nThe risk of maternal death is higher in some areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, than in others. Poverty is a problem in some countries, in particular, the developing countries.\nFemales living in poverty stricken cities or areas are more likely to be overweight or obese and have unhealthy behaviors like smoking or drug use.\nThere are a lot of reasons why females choose to not engage in proper prenatal care. Around 71% of low income women, according to a US study, had difficulty having access to prenatal care.\nIncome is highly associated with prenatal health care.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":35},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":48},{"uri":"Health_care","surface_form":"health care","offset":114},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":275},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"Female","offset":380},{"uri":"Overweight","surface_form":"overweight","offset":453},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obese","offset":467},{"uri":"Smoking","surface_form":"smoking","offset":507}]}
