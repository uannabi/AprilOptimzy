{"id":455396,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major_dwarf","text":"The Canis Major dwarf galaxy (\"CMa dwarf\") or Canis Major overdensity (\"CMa overdensity\") is a disputed dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group. It is in the same part of the sky as the constellation Canis Major.\nThe supposed small galaxy contains a relatively high percentage of red giant stars, and is thought to contain an estimated one billion stars in all.\nThe Canis Major dwarf is classified as an irregular galaxy. It is now thought to be the closest neighbouring galaxy to our position in the Milky Way. It is about 25,000 light-years away from the Solar System, and 52,000 light-years from the Galactic centre. It has a roughly elliptical shape and is thought to contain as many stars as the Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy, the previous contender for closest galaxy to us.\nDiscussion.\nThe dwarf was discovered in 2003.\nSeveral studies cast doubts on the true nature of this overdensity. Investigation of the area in 2009 showed only ten RR Lyrae variable stars. This is consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations, rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dispute","surface_form":"dispute","offset":95},{"uri":"Irregular_galaxy","surface_form":"dwarf irregular galaxy","offset":104},{"uri":"Local_Group","surface_form":"Local Group","offset":134},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":188},{"uri":"Canis_Major","surface_form":"Canis Major","offset":202},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":234},{"uri":"Red_giant","surface_form":"red giant","offset":282},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":292},{"uri":"Irregular_galaxy","surface_form":"irregular galaxy","offset":406},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":503},{"uri":"Light-years","surface_form":"light-years","offset":533},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":559},{"uri":"Galactic_centre","surface_form":"Galactic centre","offset":605},{"uri":"Sagittarius_dwarf_elliptical_galaxy","surface_form":"Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy","offset":703},{"uri":"RR_Lyrae_variable","surface_form":"RR Lyrae variable","offset":953},{"uri":"Galactic_halo","surface_form":"halo","offset":1018}]}
