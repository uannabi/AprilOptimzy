Roxas is a \"Nobody\" that was created after Sora shortly lost his heart during \"Kingdom Hearts\". Roxas first appeared in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" and was revealed to be a member of Organization XIII. The Organization needed Roxas because he could wield the Keyblade, a weapon which allows him to capture hearts. Roxas is the main character of \"2 Days\" which was created to explain his back story in more detail than \"Kingdom Hearts II\". Roxas is voiced by American singer Jesse McCartney in the English versions and voiced by K\u014Dki Uchiyama in the Japanese versions.\nSince his introduction, Roxas has received a positive critical response from fans and video game publications. In February 2010, Roxas was ranked #28 on a \"Famitsu\" poll featuring the most popular video game characters from Japan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":5},{"uri":"Kingdom_Hearts","surface_form":"Kingdom Hearts","offset":35},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":51},{"uri":"Sora_(Kingdom_Hearts)","surface_form":"Sora","offset":113},{"uri":"Kingdom_Hearts_(video_game)","surface_form":"Kingdom Hearts","offset":149},{"uri":"Kingdom_Hearts_II","surface_form":"Kingdom Hearts II","offset":191},{"uri":"Organization_XIII","surface_form":"Organization XIII","offset":245},{"uri":"2_Days","surface_form":"2 Days","offset":408},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":520},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":529},{"uri":"Jesse_McCartney","surface_form":"Jesse McCartney","offset":536},{"uri":"K%C5%8Dki_Uchiyama","surface_form":"K\u014Dki Uchiyama","offset":590},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":611},{"uri":"Famitsu","surface_form":"Famitsu","offset":786}]}
