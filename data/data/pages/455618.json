{"id":455618,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region","text":"An H\u00A0II region is a region where huge blue stars are formed from hydrogen. They are named after the ionised atomic hydrogen which they produce: H\u00A0II.\nThe stars form inside a large cloud of hydrogen gas. The short-lived blue stars formed in these regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light. This ionizes the surrounding gas.\nH\u00A0II regions can be several hundred light-years across. The first known H\u00A0II region was the Orion nebula, which was discovered in 1610. These regions have extremely varied shapes. They often appear clumpy and filamentary, sometimes showing bizarre shapes such as the Horsehead nebula.\nH\u00A0II regions give birth to thousands of stars over several million years. Eventually, this produces a star cluster. In the end, supernova explosions and strong stellar winds from the most massive stars blow away the gases of the H\u00A0II region. This leaves behind behind a cluster of stars such as the Pleiades.\nH\u00A0II regions can be seen at huge distances in the universe.The study of extragalactic H\u00A0II regions helps to fix the distance and chemical composition of other galaxies.\nSpiral and irregular galaxies have many H\u00A0II regions, while elliptical galaxies have almost none. In spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, H\u00A0II regions are found in the spiral arms, but in the irregular galaxies they are distributed at random.\nSome galaxies have huge H\u00A0II regions, with tens of thousands of stars. Examples include the 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC 604 in the Triangulum galaxy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"OB_star","surface_form":"blue stars","offset":38},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":65},{"uri":"Ionization","surface_form":"ionised","offset":100},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":108},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":115},{"uri":"Star_formation","surface_form":"stars form","offset":154},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":198},{"uri":"Ultraviolet","surface_form":"ultraviolet","offset":279},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":368},{"uri":"Orion_nebula","surface_form":"Orion nebula","offset":424},{"uri":"Horsehead_nebula","surface_form":"Horsehead nebula","offset":599},{"uri":"Star_cluster","surface_form":"star cluster","offset":719},{"uri":"Supernova","surface_form":"supernova","offset":745},{"uri":"Stellar_wind","surface_form":"stellar wind","offset":777},{"uri":"Pleiades","surface_form":"Pleiades","offset":916},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":1085},{"uri":"Spiral_galaxy","surface_form":"Spiral","offset":1095},{"uri":"Irregular_galaxy","surface_form":"irregular","offset":1106},{"uri":"Elliptical_galaxy","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":1155},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":1222},{"uri":"Spiral_arm","surface_form":"spiral arm","offset":1263},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":1330},{"uri":"30_Doradus","surface_form":"30 Doradus","offset":1430},{"uri":"Large_Magellanic_Cloud","surface_form":"Large Magellanic Cloud","offset":1455},{"uri":"NGC_604","surface_form":"NGC 604","offset":1482},{"uri":"Triangulum_galaxy","surface_form":"Triangulum galaxy","offset":1497}]}
