They are stars of types O or B in the HertzsprungRussell diagram.\nLike other giant star<nowiki/>s they are short lived, and do not move far from where they were formed. During their lifetime, they emit huge amounts of ultraviolet radiation. This radiation ionizes the surrounding interstellar gas of the nebula, forming an H II region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":31},{"uri":"HertzsprungRussell_diagram","surface_form":"HertzsprungRussell diagram","offset":76},{"uri":"Giant_star","surface_form":"giant star","offset":115},{"uri":"Ultraviolet_radiation","surface_form":"ultraviolet radiation","offset":256},{"uri":"Ionization","surface_form":"ionizes","offset":294},{"uri":"Nebula","surface_form":"nebula","offset":342},{"uri":"H_II_region","surface_form":"H II region","offset":361}]}
