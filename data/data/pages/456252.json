{"id":456252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition","text":"Extradition is a process by which someone who has committed a crime, or is suspected to have committed a crime, is handed from one jurisdiction to another. Usually, the country that wants the person makes a formal request to the other. Under international law, there is no obligation to extradite a person. There is a web of treaties, which state under what conditions extradition is possible.\nPeople who move to a different location to escape legal charges are called fugitives.\nExamples.\nIn 2019 protestors in Hong Kong demonstrated against a new extradition law proposed by the the government of mainland China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":62},{"uri":"Jurisdiction_(area)","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":131},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":242},{"uri":"Treaties","surface_form":"treaties","offset":325},{"uri":"Legal_charges","surface_form":"legal charges","offset":444},{"uri":"Protestor","surface_form":"protestor","offset":498},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":512},{"uri":"Extradition_law","surface_form":"extradition law","offset":549},{"uri":"Mainland_China","surface_form":"mainland China","offset":599}]}
