{"id":456478,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador%2C_Canada","text":"Labrador is the part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada that is on the mainland. The Strait of Belle Isle to the east is between it and the island of Newfoundland in Atlantic Canada. To the south and west is the province of Quebec.\nNot many people live in Labrador; in fact, only 8% of the population of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador lives in it, even though Labrador is twice as big as Newfoundland. Until the 1950s, most of the people who lived there were Aboriginals. Then some Europeans immigrated to the area and worked as merchants; these people were once called Settlers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","surface_form":"province","offset":28},{"uri":"Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"Newfoundland and Labrador","offset":40},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":69},{"uri":"Mainland","surface_form":"mainland","offset":91},{"uri":"Strait_of_Belle_Isle","surface_form":"Strait of Belle Isle","offset":105},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":160},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":170},{"uri":"Atlantic_Canada","surface_form":"Atlantic Canada","offset":186},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":244},{"uri":"Aboriginal","surface_form":"Aboriginal","offset":490},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigrated","offset":523},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchant","offset":560}]}
