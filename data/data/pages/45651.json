It can also be any place where people live that \"shelters\" (protects) them from any danger such as the weather.\nThere are different kinds of shelters and they are for used for different reasons.\nCurrently, Women's Shelters are found around the United States, United Kingdom, and many other First World countries. In these places, women are there to hide or are running away from abusive or dangerous situations. In these shelters, they are given food and a place to stay for an amount of time (usually 1-3 months at a time). They are put into a support group and given a temporary counselor. There is a high success rate in this type of place.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protect","surface_form":"protect","offset":153},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":196},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":337},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":352},{"uri":"First_World","surface_form":"First World","offset":383},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":395},{"uri":"Abuse","surface_form":"abusive","offset":472},{"uri":"Situations","surface_form":"situations","offset":493},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":539},{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":599},{"uri":"Support_group","surface_form":"support group","offset":638},{"uri":"Temporary","surface_form":"temporary","offset":664},{"uri":"Counselor","surface_form":"counselor","offset":674}]}
