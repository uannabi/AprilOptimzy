{"id":456543,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface","text":"e=\"preserve\">An interface is what the user uses on an operating system to make the computer do tasks, like writing a document, or loading a web page. There are two types of interfaces, a command line interface (CLI for short), or a graphical user interface (GUI for short).\nCommand line interface.\n\"See Command line interface.\"\nCommand line interfaces ask the user to type in commands in a text-based environment, not allowing images, like the screen image to the right.\nThis is hard to use for most people, mostly because when the user has to do a long command, he or she can miss a letter or two, so the computer shows an error, and he or she has to do it all over again, which can waste hours.\nGraphical user interface.\n\"See Graphical user interface.\"\nGraphical user interfaces are instead made of not only text, but also images. The first computer to do this was the Apple Lisa (1983).\nSince the top operating systems (listed above) use graphical user interfaces, they are seen on every computer. Anyone can still use a command line interface on any computer very easily.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":54},{"uri":"Web_page","surface_form":"web page","offset":140},{"uri":"Command_line_interface","surface_form":"command line interface","offset":187},{"uri":"Graphical_user_interface","surface_form":"graphical user interface","offset":232},{"uri":"Command_line_interface","surface_form":"Command line interface","offset":303},{"uri":"Text-based","surface_form":"text-based","offset":390},{"uri":"Graphical_user_interface","surface_form":"Graphical user interface","offset":728},{"uri":"Apple_Lisa","surface_form":"Apple Lisa","offset":871}]}
