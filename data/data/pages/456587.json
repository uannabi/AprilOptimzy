{"id":456587,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Plague","text":"\"My Plague\" is the third single off American metal band Slipknot's second studio album \"Iowa\". The song was released on July 8, 2002.\nOverview.\nThere was a remix for the song called \"New Abuse Mix\" that was featured on the soundtrack to the 2002 movie \"Resident Evil\". the remix cut a screamed layer of vocals and replaced it with a more monotone, drone-like sounding layer.\nVersions.\nThe new version was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional \"Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you\" section. Some of the profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases; like the phrase \"...the everyday bullshit things that you have done\" was changed to, \"...the everyday abusive things that you have done\" and \"You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart...\" was replaced with \"...and if you touch me, I will rip you apart...\". The whole second verse of the chorus was removed.\nIn 2003, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Metal Performance category but it lost to Korn's \"Here to Stay\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"metal","offset":45},{"uri":"Slipknot","surface_form":"Slipknot","offset":56},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":74},{"uri":"Iowa_(album)","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":88},{"uri":"Resident_Evil_(movie)","surface_form":"Resident Evil","offset":253},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":938},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Best_Metal_Performance","surface_form":"Best Metal Performance","offset":958},{"uri":"Korn","surface_form":"Korn","offset":1005},{"uri":"Here_to_Stay_(Korn_song)","surface_form":"Here to Stay","offset":1013}]}
