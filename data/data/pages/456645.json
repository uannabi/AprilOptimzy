He has appeared in over 200 movies and television series. He is known for his roles in \"The Jerk\", \"Blood Sample\", \"Killer Image\", \"Christmas with the Kranks\" and in \"Wild Wild West\".\nAccording to Roger Ebert's Stanton-Walsh Rule, \"no movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad.\" Ebert later conceded that this rule was broken by 1999's \"Wild Wild West\" (Walsh) and \"Dream a Little Dream\" (Stanton).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":48},{"uri":"The_Jerk_(movie)","surface_form":"The Jerk","offset":188},{"uri":"Blood_Sample","surface_form":"Blood Sample","offset":200},{"uri":"Killer_Image_(1982_movie)","surface_form":"Killer Image","offset":216},{"uri":"Christmas_with_the_Kranks","surface_form":"Christmas with the Kranks","offset":232},{"uri":"Wild_Wild_West","surface_form":"Wild Wild West","offset":267},{"uri":"Roger_Ebert","surface_form":"Roger Ebert","offset":297},{"uri":"Harry_Dean_Stanton","surface_form":"Harry Dean Stanton","offset":358},{"uri":"Wild_Wild_West","surface_form":"Wild Wild West","offset":498},{"uri":"Dream_a_Little_Dream","surface_form":"Dream a Little Dream","offset":527}]}
