{"id":45693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone","text":"(British English) (also called a half step or a half tone) is the smallest musical interval used in Western music. It is the distance between two notes which are next to one another in pitch.\nA whole tone means a distance of two semitones, i.e. the distance between two notes which are separated by one other note in pitch.\nThis is easy to see with a picture of a keyboard. The distance between two white notes that are side by side may be a whole tone (if there is a black note in between them) or a semitone (if there is no black note between).\nTo go from a C to a C sharp (or D flat) is a semitone.\nTo go from a C sharp (or D flat) to a D is a semitone.\nTo go from a C to a D is a tone.\nAn octave is divided into twelve semitones. These semitones are exactly equal in size.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":1},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":9},{"uri":"Musical_interval","surface_form":"musical interval","offset":75},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":108},{"uri":"Note_(music)","surface_form":"notes","offset":146},{"uri":"Pitch_(music)","surface_form":"pitch","offset":185},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":364},{"uri":"Octave","surface_form":"octave","offset":693}]}
