{"id":457,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature","text":"Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language, meaning \"those who write the laws.\" A legislature is therefore a group of people who vote for new laws, for example in a state or country.\nEach person in the legislature is usually either elected or appointed. The constitution of that state or country usually tells how a legislature is supposed to work.\nIn many countries, the legislature is called a Parliament, Congress, or National Assembly. Sometimes there are two groups of members in the legislature. This is called a \"bicameral\" legislature. A unicameral legislature has only one group of members.\nA country, district, city, or other small area may also have something like a legislature. These are often called councils, and they make smaller laws for their areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":42},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":87},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":179},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":246},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":272},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":410},{"uri":"Congress","surface_form":"Congress","offset":422},{"uri":"National_Assembly","surface_form":"National Assembly","offset":435},{"uri":"Bicameralism","surface_form":"bicameral","offset":534},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":616},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":625},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":635},{"uri":"Council","surface_form":"councils","offset":728}]}
