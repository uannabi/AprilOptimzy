{"id":457138,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_I","text":"The Panzer I tank was a Nazi Germany light tank that was used during many wars of the 1930s as well as during World War II. The name of the tank is short for Panzerkampfwagen I (\"armored fighting vehicle mark I\") (abbreviated \"PzKpfw I\").\nThe tank was only intended for use as a training tank to introduce the concept of armoured warfare to the German Army. The tank was used in combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The tank had thin armor and light armament of two machine guns. It was weak in combat but was a large part of Germany's tank forces. The Panzer I was replaced by the Panzer IV, Panther, and Tiger later on.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":24},{"uri":"Light_tank","surface_form":"light tank","offset":37},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":110},{"uri":"Armoured_warfare","surface_form":"armoured warfare","offset":321},{"uri":"German_Army_(1935%E2%80%9345)","surface_form":"German Army","offset":345},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":406},{"uri":"Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)","surface_form":"Poland","offset":428},{"uri":"Battle_of_France","surface_form":"France","offset":436},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":448},{"uri":"North_African_Campaign","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":465},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":489},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"China","offset":514},{"uri":"Second_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"Second Sino-Japanese War","offset":531},{"uri":"Panzer_IV","surface_form":"Panzer IV","offset":723},{"uri":"Panther_tank","surface_form":"Panther","offset":734},{"uri":"Tiger_I","surface_form":"Tiger","offset":747}]}
