{"id":45720,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_Putty","text":"Silly Putty (originally called nutty putty) is a silicone plastic \"clay\", sold as a toy for children by \"Binney & Smith Inc.\". It was created as a scientific accident when scientists in the United States were trying to find a substitute for rubber during World War II.\nDescription.\nSilly Putty is sold as a 0.47 oz (13 g) piece of plastic clay inside an egg-shaped plastic container. It is an example of an inorganic plastic (polymer). It has many unusual characteristics. When pressed on comics or other newspaper pages, the loose ink transfers to the Silly Putty, which is then able to be stretched out. It bounces, showing its rubber qualities. It breaks when you give it a sharp blow. It can flow like a liquid when it is slowly stretched and will \"melt\" into a puddle over a long enough period of time, and so shows properties of non-newtonian liquids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Silicone","surface_form":"silicone","offset":49},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":58},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":67},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy","offset":84},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":92},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific","offset":147},{"uri":"Accident","surface_form":"accident","offset":158},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":172},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":190},{"uri":"Substitute","surface_form":"substitute","offset":226},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":241},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":255},{"uri":"Ounce","surface_form":"oz","offset":312},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"g","offset":319},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":331},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":354},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":358},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"container","offset":373},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"inorganic","offset":407},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":426},{"uri":"Characteristic","surface_form":"characteristic","offset":456},{"uri":"Comic_strip","surface_form":"comics","offset":489},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":505},{"uri":"Ink","surface_form":"ink","offset":532},{"uri":"Transfer","surface_form":"transfer","offset":536},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":630},{"uri":"Quality","surface_form":"qualities","offset":637},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":708},{"uri":"Puddle","surface_form":"puddle","offset":766},{"uri":"Non-newtonian_liquid","surface_form":"non-newtonian liquid","offset":835}]}
