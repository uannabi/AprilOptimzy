{"id":457221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_is_dead","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Paul is dead\" is an urban legend and conspiracy theory suggesting that Paul McCartney of the English rock band the Beatles died in 1966 and was secretly replaced by a look-alike.\nIn September 1969, American college students published articles claiming that clues to McCartney's supposed death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Rumours declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in \"Life\" magazine in November 1969.\nPopular culture continues to make occasional reference to the legend, and McCartney poked fun at it with a 1993 live album titled \"Paul Is Live\", whose cover parodied \"clues\" allegedly on the cover of the Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" album.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urban_legend","surface_form":"urban legend","offset":34},{"uri":"Conspiracy_theory","surface_form":"conspiracy theory","offset":51},{"uri":"Paul_McCartney","surface_form":"Paul McCartney","offset":85},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":107},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"the Beatles","offset":125},{"uri":"Look-alike","surface_form":"look-alike","offset":181},{"uri":"Life_(magazine)","surface_form":"Life","offset":460},{"uri":"Paul_Is_Live","surface_form":"Paul Is Live","offset":624},{"uri":"Abbey_Road","surface_form":"Abbey Road","offset":708}]}
