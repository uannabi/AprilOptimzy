{"id":457249,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffroy%27s_cat","text":"Geoffroy's cat (\"Leopardus geoffroyi\") is a wild cat native to southern and central South America. It is about the size of a domestic cat. The species is relatively common in many areas, but is considered to be \"near threatened\" by IUCN.\nThe cat was examined and described by the early 19th century French anatomist \u00C9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. He collected it on an expedition to South America.\nEcology and distribution.\nGeoffroy's cats live in the Andes, Pampas (scrubby forest parts), and Gran Chaco landscape. They are found from southern Bolivia to the Straits of Magellan, at heights from sea level to. They prefer open woodland or scrubland habitats with plenty of cover, but are also found in grasslands and marshy areas. Although they are able to climb trees, they rarely do so, except to leave faeces to scent mark their territory.\nGeoffroy's cat is nocturnal. It eats rodents, hares, small lizards, insects, and occasionally frogs and fish. Like other small cats, it is a solitary hunter, and only comes together during the mating season. Females have territories ranging from, while males have larger ranges, reaching up to.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"cat","offset":49},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":84},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":134},{"uri":"Near_Threatened","surface_form":"near threatened","offset":212},{"uri":"%C3%89tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","surface_form":"\u00C9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire","offset":316},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":384},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":453},{"uri":"Pampas","surface_form":"Pampas","offset":460},{"uri":"Gran_Chaco","surface_form":"Gran Chaco","offset":495},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":546},{"uri":"Straits_of_Magellan","surface_form":"Straits of Magellan","offset":561},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":629},{"uri":"Scrubland","surface_form":"scrubland","offset":641},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":651},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":704},{"uri":"Marsh","surface_form":"marsh","offset":719},{"uri":"Faeces","surface_form":"faeces","offset":807},{"uri":"Scent","surface_form":"scent","offset":817},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":882},{"uri":"Hare","surface_form":"hare","offset":891},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":904},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":913},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":939},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":949}]}
