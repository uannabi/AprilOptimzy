On 17 July 2014 the flight lost radar contact. It crashed near the village of Hrabove, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. The plane was a Boeing 777-200ER. It had 283 passengers and 15 crew members onboard at the time of the crash. All 298 people were killed.\nIt was suspected by Ukraine that the aircraft was shot down by a ground-to-air missile, fired by Pro-Russian separatists. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called it an \"act of terrorism.\" The cause of the crash has not yet been determined by the official investigation, which is being carried out by the\u00A0Dutch Safety Board. Fighting delayed investigation, but in October 2018 Dutch investigators said the plane was destroyed as a result of the explosion of a BUK missile.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amsterdam_Airport_Schiphol","surface_form":"Schiphol airport","offset":93},{"uri":"Amsterdam","surface_form":"Amsterdam","offset":111},{"uri":"Kuala_Lumpur","surface_form":"Kuala Lumpur","offset":124},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":138},{"uri":"Hrabove%2C_Donetsk_Oblast","surface_form":"Hrabove","offset":226},{"uri":"Donetsk_Oblast","surface_form":"Donetsk Oblast","offset":235},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":251},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":418},{"uri":"Petro_Poroshenko","surface_form":"Petro Poroshenko","offset":540},{"uri":"Dutch_Safety_Board","surface_form":"Dutch Safety Board","offset":706}]}
