{"id":457501,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_attack","text":"When a dog attacks and bites a human this is generally known as dog attack. Dogs have been among the first animals to be domesticated and have lived with humans for a long time. Dog attacks are common in daily life. The biting dog causes an injury, which may be serious, and may lead to death. In addition to the bite wound, the dog may transmit diseases through the bite; one example for a disease transmitted through biting is rabies.\nThere is a discussion whether certain breeds of dogs are more prone to producing an attack than others.\nVery often, the attack is triggered by human behavior.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":7},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":31},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"domesticated","offset":121},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injury","offset":241},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":346},{"uri":"Rabies","surface_form":"rabies","offset":429},{"uri":"Dog_breed","surface_form":"breeds","offset":475},{"uri":"Behavior","surface_form":"behavior","offset":586}]}
