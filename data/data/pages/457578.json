{"id":457578,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_vector","text":"e=\"preserve\">A null vector is a special vector, which is the identity element for the addition of vectors, in a given vector space. As an example, the null vector of n-dimensional coordinate space is a vector whose components are all 0. It is often denoted by the symbol formula_1 (which distinguishes it from the number formula_1).\nNull vectors are used to define key concepts of linear algebra, such as linear independence, basis and kernel. They are used to solve linear equations as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":40},{"uri":"Identity_element","surface_form":"identity element","offset":61},{"uri":"Vector_space","surface_form":"vector space","offset":118},{"uri":"Linear_algebra","surface_form":"linear algebra","offset":381},{"uri":"Linear_independence","surface_form":"linear independence","offset":405},{"uri":"Basis_(linear_algebra)","surface_form":"basis","offset":426},{"uri":"Kernel_(mathematics)","surface_form":"kernel","offset":436},{"uri":"Linear_equation","surface_form":"linear equations","offset":467}]}
