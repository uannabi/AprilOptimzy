{"id":457585,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maritimes","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Maritime provinces, or the Maritimes, is a region of Eastern Canada with three provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Along with Newfoundland and Labrador, they form Atlantic Canada.\nSome people have proposed merging all three provinces into a single province called the Maritime Union.\nBoth Great Britain and France settled the area in the 17th century. After the French and Indian War, the British ruled the entire area. The Charlottetown Conference was held in 1864 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The Conference was about the various colonies of British North America forming the Canadian Confederation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":60},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"East","offset":70},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":78},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":96},{"uri":"New_Brunswick","surface_form":"New Brunswick","offset":107},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":122},{"uri":"Prince_Edward_Island","surface_form":"Prince Edward Island","offset":139},{"uri":"Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"Newfoundland and Labrador","offset":172},{"uri":"Atlantic_Canada","surface_form":"Atlantic Canada","offset":209},{"uri":"Maritime_Union","surface_form":"Maritime Union","offset":314},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":335},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":353},{"uri":"French_and_Indian_War","surface_form":"French and Indian War","offset":408},{"uri":"Charlottetown_Conference","surface_form":"Charlottetown Conference","offset":470},{"uri":"Charlottetown","surface_form":"Charlottetown","offset":515},{"uri":"Prince_Edward_Island","surface_form":"Prince Edward Island","offset":530},{"uri":"Colonies","surface_form":"colonies","offset":589},{"uri":"British_North_America","surface_form":"British North America","offset":601},{"uri":"Canadian_Confederation","surface_form":"Canadian Confederation","offset":635}]}
