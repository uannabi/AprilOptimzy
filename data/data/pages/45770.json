{"id":45770,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puddle","text":"A puddle is a small mass of liquid, usually water, uncontained on a surface. It can form either in depressions in the surface, or directly upon the flat surface, held together by surface tension. A puddle is generally considered to be small enough to step over or shallow enough to walk through, and too small to traverse with a boat.\nPuddles commonly form during rainstorms, and can cause problems for transport, especially when combined with cold conditions to form patches of ice, which are highly slippery and difficult to see.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":28},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":44},{"uri":"Surface_tension","surface_form":"surface tension","offset":179},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":329},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":364},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":479}]}
