{"id":457709,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party","text":"The New Democratic Party (NDP) is a social democratic political party in Canada. It was formed in 1961 when the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation merged with the Canadian Labour Congress. In Canadian politics, the NDP is to the left of the Liberal Party.\nWings of the NDP have formed governments in several provinces. It forms the current government in British Columbia. In the 2011 federal elections it won 98 out of 308 seats in the House of Commons.\nThe current party leader is Jagmeet Singh. He became the leader in October 2017.\nProvincial and territorial parties.\nThe NDP is not like other Canadian political parties. All the provincial and territorial parties are a direct part of the national/federal NDP. This means that if someone is a member of a provincial NDP party, they are automatically a member of the federal NDP.\nThis is not the case in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Quebec. This is because both the governments of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are consensus governments. Because of this, those governments don't have political parties. The NDP are represented by their groups in charge of the ridings in those territories (both Nunavut and the Northwest Territories each have one riding). In Quebec in 1989, the provincial NDP and the federal NDP decided to separate. This is because the Quebec NDP wanted Quebec to leave Canada. In 2014, the Quebec NDP restarted but it is not related to the federal NDP.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["political party"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Social_democracy","surface_form":"social democratic","offset":36},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":54},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":73},{"uri":"Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation","surface_form":"Co-operative Commonwealth Federation","offset":112},{"uri":"Canadian_Labour_Congress","surface_form":"Canadian Labour Congress","offset":165},{"uri":"Politics_of_Canada","surface_form":"Canadian politics","offset":194},{"uri":"Left%E2%80%93right_politics","surface_form":"left","offset":231},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Canada","surface_form":"Liberal Party","offset":243},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":310},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":356},{"uri":"Canadian_federal_election%2C_2011","surface_form":"2011 federal elections","offset":381},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_Canada","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":438},{"uri":"Jagmeet_Singh","surface_form":"Jagmeet Singh","offset":484},{"uri":"Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","surface_form":"provincial and territorial","offset":635},{"uri":"Northwest_Territories","surface_form":"Northwest Territories","offset":863},{"uri":"Nunavut","surface_form":"Nunavut","offset":886},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":899},{"uri":"Consensus_governments","surface_form":"consensus governments","offset":989},{"uri":"Electoral_district_(Canada)","surface_form":"ridings","offset":1134},{"uri":"Quebec_sovereignty","surface_form":"Quebec to leave Canada","offset":1347}]}
