{"id":45772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(structure)","text":"A beam is a structural element that carries structural load.\nBeams generally carry vertical forces, but can also be used to carry horizontal loads (Those loads can result from wind or an earthquake). The loads that a beam carries are led to columns or walls, which lead the force to the next element.\nBeams are characterized by their profile (their shape), their length, and their material. In constructions of today beams are mostly made of steel, reinforced concrete, or wood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Element","surface_form":"element","offset":23},{"uri":"Structural_load","surface_form":"structural load","offset":44},{"uri":"Vertical","surface_form":"vertical","offset":83},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"forces","offset":92},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":130},{"uri":"Load","surface_form":"load","offset":141},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":176},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":187},{"uri":"Column","surface_form":"column","offset":241},{"uri":"Wall","surface_form":"wall","offset":252},{"uri":"Profile","surface_form":"profile","offset":334},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":349},{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":363},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":381},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":394},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":442},{"uri":"Reinforced_concrete","surface_form":"reinforced concrete","offset":449},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":473}]}
