Capital of this region is Taldykorgan, which has a population of 123,000. Population of the region: 1,807,894 (2009); 1,557,269 (1999).\nGeography.\nAlmaty Region is the province which surrounds the city of Almaty. The province borders Kyrgyzstan and Xinjiang (East Turkestan) autonomous province in China. The province also touches three other Kazakh provinces: Jambyl Province to the west, Karagandy Province to the northwest and East Kazakhstan Province to the north. Almaty Province has an area of 224,000 square kilometres.\nHistory.\nAlma-Ata Province, the predecessor of today's Almaty Province, was created from the historical region of Zhetysu on March 10, 1932. Its capital was Alma-Ata (Almaty). Several times during the Soviet period, the north-eastern part of the province, centered on Taldykorgan, was separated from Alma-Ata Province, forming a separate Taldy-Kurgan Province, only to be merged into Alma-Ata Province again several years later.\nIn April 2001 the administrative center of Almaty Province was moved from Almaty to Taldykorgan. Thus Taldykorgan has become a provincial capital again - this time without splitting a province.\nDemographics.\nIn the 1989 census (excepting Alma-Ata)\nIn the 1999 census (excepting Almaty)\nIn the 2009 census (excepting Almaty)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":50},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":60},{"uri":"Taldykorgan","surface_form":"Taldykorgan","offset":98},{"uri":"Almaty","surface_form":"Almaty","offset":277},{"uri":"Kyrgyzstan","surface_form":"Kyrgyzstan","offset":306},{"uri":"Xinjiang","surface_form":"Xinjiang","offset":321},{"uri":"East_Turkestan","surface_form":"East Turkestan","offset":331},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":370},{"uri":"Jambyl_Province","surface_form":"Jambyl Province","offset":433},{"uri":"Karagandy_Province","surface_form":"Karagandy Province","offset":462},{"uri":"East_Kazakhstan_Province","surface_form":"East Kazakhstan Province","offset":502},{"uri":"Zhetysu","surface_form":"Zhetysu","offset":713},{"uri":"Almaty","surface_form":"Almaty","offset":766},{"uri":"Taldykorgan","surface_form":"Taldykorgan","offset":867}]}
