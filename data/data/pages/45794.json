The bow is helpful for letting the ship smoothly pass through the ocean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hull_(watercraft)","surface_form":"hull","offset":35},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":45},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":53},{"uri":"Vessel","surface_form":"vessel","offset":99},{"uri":"Resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":153}]}
