{"id":45798,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambucus","text":"\"Sambucus\" is a genus in the family Adoxaceae. It is commonly called Elder or Elderberry. It includes several similar types of shrubs that produce fruit that is also called elderberries. The plant can be found in swampy habitats and other areas that provide enough water.\nBlack Elderberry has been found to be effective against the H5N1 strain of Avian Flu (Zakay-Rones et al. 1995). Black Elderberry contains a unique compound called Antivirin\u00AE that can help protect healthy cells and inactivate infectious viruses. When given to patients, scientists have found the Black Elderberry, has the ability to ward off flu infections quickly (Zakay-Rones 2004). Black Elderberries are rich in anthocyanins which are a type of flavonoid \u2013 anthocyanins are antioxidants that may protect cells from free radicals and support your body\u2019s immune system.\nBlack Elderberries have almost 5 times as many anthocyanins as Blueberries and twice the overall antioxidant capability of cranberries\nBlack Elderberry has a more potent antiviral effect than Echinacea. At sites in Switzerland and Italy, researchers have uncovered evidence that the black elderberry may have been cultivated by prehistoric man, and there are recipes for elderberry-based medications in the records dating as far back as Ancient Egypt. Historians, however, generally trace the tradition of the elderberry\u2019s healing power back to Hippocrates, the ancient Greek known as the \u201Cfather of medicine,\u201D who described this plant as his \u201Cmedicine chest\u201D for the wide variety of ailments it seemed to cure.\nOver the centuries, elderberry has been used to treat colds, flu, fever, burns, cuts, and more than 70 other maladies, from a toothache to the plague. In the 17th century, John Evelyn, a British researcher, declared, \u201CIf the medicinal properties of its leaves, bark, and berries were fully known, I cannot tell what our countryman could ail for which he might not fetch a remedy [from the elderberry], either for sickness or wounds.\u201D\nElderberry can grow in the form of a shrub or small tree, reaching up to 6 feet in height and width depending on the variety. It blooms during the spring or summer, and its flowers contain both male and female reproductive systems in the event that it is unable to reproduce through cross-pollination. It can be used to create a violet dye.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":29},{"uri":"Adoxaceae","surface_form":"Adoxaceae","offset":36},{"uri":"Similar","surface_form":"similar","offset":110},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":127},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":147}]}
