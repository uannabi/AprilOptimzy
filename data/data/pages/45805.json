{"id":45805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinium_arboreum","text":"\"Vaccinium arboreum\" (also called sparkleberry or farkleberry) is a species of Vaccinium native to south-eastern United States. They are usually found in southern Virginia west to southeastern Missouri, and south to Florida and eastern Texas.\nVaccinium arboreum is a shrub (rarely a small tree) growing to 3-5 metres (sometimes up to 9 metres) tall. The leaves are evergreen in the south of the range, but deciduous farther north where winters are colder. They are oval-elliptic with an acute apex, 3-7 cm long and 2-4 cm broad, with a smooth or very finely toothed margin. The flowers are white, bell-shaped, 3-4 mm in diameter, with a five-lobed corolla, produced in racemes up to 5 cm long. The fruit is a round dry berry about 6 mm diameter, green at first, black when ripe, edible but bitter and tough.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vaccinium","surface_form":"Vaccinium","offset":79},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":113},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":163},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":193},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":216},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":236},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":267},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":289},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":310},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":354},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":365},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":406},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":436},{"uri":"Apex","surface_form":"apex","offset":493},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"cm","offset":503},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":578},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"mm","offset":614},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":620},{"uri":"Raceme","surface_form":"raceme","offset":669},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":698}]}
