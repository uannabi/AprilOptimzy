{"id":45809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantaloupe","text":"A cantaloupe (also known as a rockmelon, sweet melon, or spanspek) is a type of fruit. It is a muskmelon that is probably related to the watermelon. There are two types of cantaloupe, European and North American. Cantaloupes range in size from 0.5 to 5.0 kilograms (1.1 to 11\u00A0lb).\nNutrition.\nCantaloupes are a source of polyphenol antioxidants. These are chemicals which were thought to provide certain health benefits to the cardiovascular and immune systems by regulating the formation of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a key chemical in promoting health of the endothelium and prevention of heart attacks. However, recent research has indicated they do not benefit the body. The body already has ways to deal with oxidation.\nCantaloupes also are an excellent source of vitamin C.\nDirty cantaloupes can spread bacteria. In 2011, 21 people died in the United States from cantaloupes having \"listeria\" bacteria. The bad cantaloupes were traced back from around the country to a single farm in Colorado.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":80},{"uri":"Muskmelon","surface_form":"muskmelon","offset":95},{"uri":"Watermelon","surface_form":"watermelon","offset":137},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":184},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":197},{"uri":"Polyphenol_antioxidant","surface_form":"polyphenol antioxidant","offset":320},{"uri":"Cardiovascular_system","surface_form":"cardiovascular","offset":426},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune system","offset":445},{"uri":"Nitric_oxide","surface_form":"nitric oxide","offset":491},{"uri":"Endothelium","surface_form":"endothelium","offset":563},{"uri":"Myocardial_infarction","surface_form":"heart attacks","offset":593},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidation","offset":716},{"uri":"Vitamin_C","surface_form":"vitamin C","offset":771},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":811},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":852},{"uri":"Listeria","surface_form":"listeria","offset":891}]}
