{"id":458190,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles","text":"\"Anopheles\" is a genus of mosquito.\nThere about 460 species, and over 100 can transmit human malaria. Only 30\u201340 commonly transmit parasites of the genus \"Plasmodium\", which causes human malaria in endemic areas. \"Anopheles gambiae\" is one of the best known, because it transmits the most dangerous malarial parasite species (to humans) \u2013 \"Plasmodium falciparum\".\nSome species of \"Anopheles\" are vectors for canine heartworm \"Dirofilaria immitis\", filariasis, and viruses such as one that causes O'nyong'nyong fever. Brain tumors sometimes occur in malaria sufferers, which suggests that \"Anopheles\" might transmit a virus or other agent which could cause a brain tumor.\nMosquitoes in other genera (\"Aedes\", \"Culex\", \"Culiseta\", \"Haemagogus\" and \"Ochlerotatus\") can also be vectors of disease agents, but not malaria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":17},{"uri":"Mosquito","surface_form":"mosquito","offset":26},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":93},{"uri":"Parasites","surface_form":"parasites","offset":131},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":148},{"uri":"Plasmodium","surface_form":"Plasmodium","offset":155},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":198},{"uri":"Anopheles_gambiae","surface_form":"Anopheles gambiae","offset":214},{"uri":"Plasmodium_falciparum","surface_form":"Plasmodium falciparum","offset":340},{"uri":"Vector_(biology)","surface_form":"vectors","offset":396},{"uri":"Heartworm","surface_form":"heartworm","offset":415},{"uri":"Filariasis","surface_form":"filariasis","offset":448},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":464},{"uri":"O%27nyong%27nyong","surface_form":"O'nyong'nyong","offset":496},{"uri":"Brain_tumor","surface_form":"Brain tumor","offset":517},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":549},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":691},{"uri":"Aedes","surface_form":"Aedes","offset":700},{"uri":"Culex","surface_form":"Culex","offset":709},{"uri":"Culiseta","surface_form":"Culiseta","offset":718},{"uri":"Haemagogus","surface_form":"Haemagogus","offset":730},{"uri":"Ochlerotatus","surface_form":"Ochlerotatus","offset":747}]}
