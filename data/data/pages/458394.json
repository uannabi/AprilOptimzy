He worked with leading American soloists, such as Anthony Braxton, Steve Lacy, Don Cherry, Roswell Rudd, Eddie Gomez, Max Roach, Nacci Alberto, but also with the Argentinian Gato Barbieri and Frenchman Jean-Luc Ponty.\nHe has also adapted the compositions of Albert Ayler and Sun Ra for solo piano, which the Soul Note label has issued.
