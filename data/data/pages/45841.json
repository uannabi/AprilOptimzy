{"id":45841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree","text":"The Christmas tree is a tradition associated with the celebration of Christmas. It is normally an evergreen coniferous tree that is cut and brought into the home. In Europe, the tree is traditionally a Norway spruce tree.\nThe tree is decorated with Christmas lights and colourful ornaments during the days around Christmas. An angel or a star is often placed at the top of the tree. Fir trees outside the home may be decorated in a similar fashion. The custom of the Christmas tree has its origin among the Protestant peoples of Northern Europe. It is not a religious symbol.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":24},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":69},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":98},{"uri":"Coniferous","surface_form":"coniferous","offset":108},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":119},{"uri":"Spruce","surface_form":"Norway spruce","offset":202},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"angel","offset":327},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":338},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":507}]}
