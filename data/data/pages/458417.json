The team is part of the East Division of the Canadian Football League (\u201CCFL\u201D). It plays its home games in TD Place Stadium.\nThere were two other CFL teams in Ottawa before the REDBLACKS started. The original CFL team, the Ottawa Rough Riders, folded in 1996. A second team, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2006. The Redblacks team was formed in 2008, but problems with the team's stadium kept the team from playing until the 2014 CFL season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadian_football","surface_form":"Canadian football","offset":52},{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":78},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":86},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":95},{"uri":"CFL_East_Division","surface_form":"East Division","offset":127},{"uri":"Canadian_Football_League","surface_form":"Canadian Football League","offset":148},{"uri":"TD_Place","surface_form":"TD Place Stadium","offset":209},{"uri":"Ottawa_Rough_Riders","surface_form":"Ottawa Rough Riders","offset":325},{"uri":"Ottawa_Renegades","surface_form":"Ottawa Renegades","offset":381},{"uri":"2014_CFL_season","surface_form":"2014 CFL season","offset":538}]}
