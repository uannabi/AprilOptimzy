{"id":458474,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm","text":"An aortic aneurysm is a general term for an enlargement (dilation) of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times normal size. While the cause of an aneurysm may be unknown, the end result is weakness in the wall of the aorta at that location.\nThe aneurysm may occasionally cause pain, which is a sign of impending rupture. When rupture occurs, massive internal hemorrhage results, and, unless treated immediately, shock and death can occur within minutes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aorta","surface_form":"aorta","offset":74},{"uri":"Hemorrhage","surface_form":"hemorrhage","offset":354}]}
