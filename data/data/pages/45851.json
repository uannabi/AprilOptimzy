{"id":45851,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language","text":"The Lithuanian language is a Baltic language. It is from Lithuania, spoken in a few countries in Europe, as well as in the Americas and Australia.\nLithuanian and Latvian are the only remaining Baltic languages. Both languages have much in common. Lithuanian, however, adopted fewer words and phrases from German and other languages. However, many words were adopted into Lithuanian by Slavic languages long ago, but in 1920, Lithuanian philologist Jonas Jablonskis and others replaced them with native Lithuanian words..\nThere are two main dialects of Lithuanian. \"Samogitian\" is used mostly in West Lithuania, and the other that is widely used in the whole country is \"Auk\u0161taitian\" (Highlanders' dialect). The standard Lithuanian comes from West Auk\u0161taitian.\nThe first book written in Lithuanian is \"Katekizmas\" by Martynas Ma\u017Evydas. It was published in East Prussia in 1547.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baltic_languages","surface_form":"Baltic language","offset":29},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":57},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":97},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":119},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":136},{"uri":"Latvian_language","surface_form":"Latvian","offset":162},{"uri":"German","surface_form":"German","offset":305},{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic languages","offset":385},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":540},{"uri":"Katekizmas","surface_form":"Katekizmas","offset":801},{"uri":"Martynas_Ma%C5%BEvydas","surface_form":"Martynas Ma\u017Evydas","offset":816},{"uri":"East_Prussia","surface_form":"East Prussia","offset":855},{"uri":"1547","surface_form":"1547","offset":871}]}
