{"id":45866,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer","text":"The Conifers are cone-bearing seed plants. Most are trees; some are shrubs. They are formally the Division Pinophyta or Coniferophyta.\nConifers are Gymnosperms. They are cone-bearing seed plants with vascular tissue. All living conifers are woody plants, and most are trees.\nLiving conifers are all in the order Pinales. Typical examples include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauris, larches, pines, redwoods, spruces, and yews.\nSpecies of conifers can be found in almost all parts of the world, and are often the most common plants in their habitats, as in the taiga. Conifers are of great economic value, and their wood is mainly used for timber and paper making. The wood of conifers is known as softwood, though yew wood is actually quite hard. The division \"Coniferae\" contains about 700 living species.\nEvolution.\nThe earliest conifers were in the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) period (about 300 million years ago), Pinophytes, Cycads, and Ginkgos all developed at this time. These plants live without being so dependent on water. Other adaptations are pollen (so Fertilization can occur without water) and the seed, which allows the embryo to be transported and developed elsewhere.\nConifers appear to be one of the taxa that benefited from the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event. They were the dominant land plants of the Mesozoic era. Conifers were eventually overtaken by the flowering plants, which first appeared in the Cretaceous. Flowering plants became dominant in the Cainozoic era.\nConifers were the main food of herbivorous dinosaurs, and their resins and poisons no doubt gave them some protection against herbivores. All the reproductive features of modern conifers had evolved by the end of the Mesozoic era.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conifer_cone","surface_form":"cone","offset":17},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":35},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":52},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":68},{"uri":"Division_(botany)","surface_form":"Division","offset":98},{"uri":"Gymnosperm","surface_form":"Gymnosperm","offset":148},{"uri":"Vascular_tissue","surface_form":"vascular tissue","offset":200},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":268},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":306},{"uri":"Cedar","surface_form":"cedar","offset":346},{"uri":"Cypress","surface_form":"cypress","offset":354},{"uri":"Fir","surface_form":"fir","offset":365},{"uri":"Juniper","surface_form":"juniper","offset":371},{"uri":"Agathis","surface_form":"kauris","offset":381},{"uri":"Larch","surface_form":"larch","offset":389},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"pine","offset":398},{"uri":"Redwood","surface_form":"redwood","offset":405},{"uri":"Spruce","surface_form":"spruce","offset":415},{"uri":"Yew","surface_form":"yew","offset":428},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":547},{"uri":"Taiga","surface_form":"taiga","offset":567},{"uri":"Timber","surface_form":"timber","offset":646},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":657},{"uri":"Softwood","surface_form":"softwood","offset":704},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":805},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":864},{"uri":"Pennsylvanian","surface_form":"Pennsylvanian","offset":879},{"uri":"Cycad","surface_form":"Cycad","offset":944},{"uri":"Ginkgo","surface_form":"Ginkgo","offset":956},{"uri":"Adaptations","surface_form":"adaptations","offset":1053},{"uri":"Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event","surface_form":"Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event","offset":1262},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":1339},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":1348},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":1395},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":1441},{"uri":"Cainozoic","surface_form":"Cainozoic","offset":1493},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":1539},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":1551},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":1572},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":1583},{"uri":"Defence_against_herbivory","surface_form":"protection against herbivores","offset":1615}]}
