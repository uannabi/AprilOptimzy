{"id":458725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones","text":"The metatarsus or metatarsal bones are a group of five long bones in the foot. They are between the tarsal bones of the hind and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes.\nThe metatarsal bones are numbered from the side of the large toe: the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal. They can be numbered with Roman numerals. The metatarsals are like the metacarpal bones of the hand.\nThe metatarsal bones are often broken by soccer players. This may be caused by the lightweight design of modern football boots, which give less protection to the foot. In 2010 some soccer players began testing a new sock that had a rubber silicon pad over the foot to protect the top of the foot.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Foot","surface_form":"foot","offset":73},{"uri":"Tarsals","surface_form":"tarsal bones","offset":100},{"uri":"Phalanges","surface_form":"phalanges","offset":146},{"uri":"Roman_numerals","surface_form":"Roman numerals","offset":317},{"uri":"Metacarpus","surface_form":"metacarpal","offset":362},{"uri":"Hand","surface_form":"hand","offset":386},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer","offset":433},{"uri":"Boot","surface_form":"boot","offset":513}]}
