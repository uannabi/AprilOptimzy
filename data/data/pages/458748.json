{"id":458748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson%2C_New_Zealand","text":"Nelson is a city on New Zealand's South Island. It is on the eastern side of Tasman Bay. It was founded in 1841 and is New Zealand's second oldest city and the oldest city on the South Island. It has a population of 46,437. Abel Tasman National Park, Kahurangi National Park, and Nelson Lakes National Park are all near the city.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe city was named in honor of the British Admiral Horatio Nelson. He defeated both the French and Spanish fleets at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Nelson's M\u0101ori name was Whakat\u016B. It meant to \"build', \"raise\", or \"establish\".\nHistory.\nEarly settlement of Nelson began in the 1300s by the M\u0101ori. The region was lived in by the M\u0101ori. But there were no permanent settlements in the area until the first Europeans arrived in the early 1840s. Queen Victoria made it the seat of an Anglican Bishopric in 1858 and Nelson became a city. The city grew slowly until the 1950s when it developed suburbs. Nelson remains a compact city with most attractions within walking distance. The city's main landmark is Christ Church Cathedral, on Church Hill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":20},{"uri":"South_Island","surface_form":"South Island","offset":34},{"uri":"Tasman_Bay","surface_form":"Tasman Bay","offset":77},{"uri":"Abel_Tasman_National_Park","surface_form":"Abel Tasman National Park","offset":224},{"uri":"Kahurangi_National_Park","surface_form":"Kahurangi National Park","offset":251},{"uri":"Nelson_Lakes_National_Park","surface_form":"Nelson Lakes National Park","offset":280},{"uri":"Horatio_Nelson","surface_form":"Horatio Nelson","offset":401},{"uri":"First_French_Empire","surface_form":"French","offset":438},{"uri":"Enlightenment_in_Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":449},{"uri":"Battle_of_Trafalgar","surface_form":"Battle of Trafalgar","offset":471},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_language","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":509},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":652},{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"permanent settlements","offset":704},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":754},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":792},{"uri":"Anglican","surface_form":"Anglican","offset":830},{"uri":"Bishopric","surface_form":"Bishopric","offset":839},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":938},{"uri":"Christ_Church_Cathedral","surface_form":"Christ Church Cathedral","offset":1052}]}
