{"id":458914,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore_shark_attacks_of_1916","text":"The Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 were a series of shark attacks along the coast of New Jersey between July 1 and July 12, 1916. Four people were killed and one injured.\nSince 1916, scholars have debated which shark species was responsible and the number of animals involved. The Great white shark and the Bull shark are mostly thought to be the shark species being blamed for the attack. The attacks happened during a deadly summer heat wave and polio epidemic in the Northeastern United States. It drove thousands of people to the seaside resorts of the Jersey Shore.\nThe shark attack led many meetings about public awareness in congress by the United States House of Representatives and by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson.\nShark attacks on the Atlantic Coast of the United States outside the semitropical states of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas were rare, but scholars believe that the increased presence of sharks and humans in the water led to the attacks in 1916.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shark","surface_form":"shark","offset":56},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":89},{"uri":"Great_white_shark","surface_form":"Great white shark","offset":285},{"uri":"Bull_shark","surface_form":"Bull shark","offset":311},{"uri":"Heat_wave","surface_form":"heat wave","offset":438},{"uri":"Polio","surface_form":"polio","offset":452},{"uri":"Northeastern_United_States","surface_form":"Northeastern United States","offset":474},{"uri":"Resort","surface_form":"resort","offset":546},{"uri":"Jersey_Shore","surface_form":"Jersey Shore","offset":561},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":652},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":698},{"uri":"Woodrow_Wilson","surface_form":"Woodrow Wilson","offset":729},{"uri":"East_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Atlantic Coast of the United States","offset":766},{"uri":"Subtropics","surface_form":"semitropical","offset":814},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":837},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":846},{"uri":"The_Carolinas","surface_form":"the Carolinas","offset":859}]}
