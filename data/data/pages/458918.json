She was named for the city of Indianapolis, Indiana.\nOn 30 July 1945, after delivering parts for the first atomic bomb to the United States air base at Tinian, the ship was torpedoed by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine \"I-58\". It sank in 12 minutes. Of 1,196 crewmen aboard, approximately 300 went down with the ship.\nThe remaining 900 faced exposure, dehydration, saltwater poisoning, and shark attacks while floating with few lifeboats and almost no food or water. The Navy learned of the sinking when survivors were spotted four days later by the crew of a PV-1 Ventura on routine patrol. Only 317 survived.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heavy_cruiser","surface_form":"heavy cruiser","offset":33},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":54},{"uri":"Indianapolis%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Indianapolis, Indiana","offset":104},{"uri":"Little_Boy","surface_form":"first atomic bomb","offset":175},{"uri":"Tinian","surface_form":"Tinian","offset":226},{"uri":"Torpedo","surface_form":"torpedo","offset":247},{"uri":"Imperial_Japanese_Navy","surface_form":"Imperial Japanese Navy","offset":264},{"uri":"Hypothermia","surface_form":"exposure","offset":420},{"uri":"Dehydration","surface_form":"dehydration","offset":430},{"uri":"Hypernatremia","surface_form":"saltwater poisoning","offset":443},{"uri":"Shark","surface_form":"shark","offset":468},{"uri":"PV-1_Ventura","surface_form":"PV-1 Ventura","offset":638}]}
