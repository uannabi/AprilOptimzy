{"id":459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra","text":"e=\"preserve\">Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics. It came from mathematicians trying to solve systems of linear equations. Vectors and matrices are used to solve these systems. The main objects of study currently are vector spaces and linear mappings between vector spaces. Linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics (e.g. differential equations and analytic geometry). It can also be applied to the real world in areas such as engineering, physics and economics.\nLinear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate (rearrange) systems of linear equations.\nThese two equations form a system of linear equations.\nIt is linear because none of the variables are raised to a power.\nThe graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line.\nThis is because it makes all of the original equations valid, that is, the value on the left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations.\nLinear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior, called a matrix. For the previous example, the coefficients of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":43},{"uri":"Mathematicians","surface_form":"mathematicians","offset":69},{"uri":"Linear_equation","surface_form":"linear equation","offset":111},{"uri":"Vectors","surface_form":"Vectors","offset":129},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrices","offset":141},{"uri":"Vector_space","surface_form":"vector space","offset":223},{"uri":"Linear_mapping","surface_form":"linear mapping","offset":241},{"uri":"Differential_equations","surface_form":"differential equations","offset":344},{"uri":"Analytic_geometry","surface_form":"analytic geometry","offset":371},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":449},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":462},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":474},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":492},{"uri":"Solve","surface_form":"solve","offset":518},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":569},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":668},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"power","offset":694},{"uri":"Graph","surface_form":"graph","offset":705},{"uri":"Straight","surface_form":"straight","offset":754},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":763},{"uri":"Value","surface_form":"value","offset":844},{"uri":"Equals_sign","surface_form":"equals sign","offset":874},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrix","offset":1039},{"uri":"Coefficient","surface_form":"coefficient","offset":1077}]}
