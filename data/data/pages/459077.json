{"id":459077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Iselle_(2014)","text":"Hurricane Iselle was a Pacific tropical cyclone. The storm threatened the islands of Hawaii, especially Hilo. The storm developed on July 31, 2014. Iselle is the first hurricane to hit the islands in 22 years.\nIselle approached Hawaii as a powerful category 4 hurricane. It had sustained winds of about 120 knots (138 mph). A number of conditions caused it to weaken just before it approached Hawaii. It struck the Big Island as a strong tropical storm. The storm center made landfall at about 2:30 am on August 8. It left downed trees and about 25,000 people without electric power. The storm surge caused 25-foot waves. Airlines had to cancel about 50 flights due to the storm.\nIselle then followed a northwestern track missing the rest of the Hawaiian islands. They received rain and winds. A woman hiker on Kauai was swept away and drowned in the storm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":23},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":31},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":53},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":85},{"uri":"Hilo%2C_Hawaii","surface_form":"Hilo","offset":104},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":168},{"uri":"Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"category 4 hurricane","offset":249},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"sustained winds","offset":278},{"uri":"Weak","surface_form":"weak","offset":360},{"uri":"Hawaii_(island)","surface_form":"Big Island","offset":415},{"uri":"Landfall_(meteorology)","surface_form":"landfall","offset":476},{"uri":"Electric_power","surface_form":"electric power","offset":568},{"uri":"Northwest","surface_form":"northwest","offset":703},{"uri":"Hike","surface_form":"hike","offset":802},{"uri":"Kauai","surface_form":"Kauai","offset":811},{"uri":"Drowning","surface_form":"drowned","offset":836}]}
