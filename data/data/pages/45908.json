{"id":45908,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_line","text":"The tree-line or timberline is the edge of the habitat at which trees can grow. Beyond the tree-line, they are unable to grow as conditions are too bad.\nAt the tree-line, tree growth is often not clear with the last trees forming low bushes. If it is caused by wind, these are known as krummholz, from the German for 'twisted wood'.\nThe tree line, like many other natural lines (lake boundaries, for example), appears well-defined from a distance, but upon close inspection, it is not that clear. Trees grow shorter until they simply stop growing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":47},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":64},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":306},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":379}]}
