{"id":45921,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro","text":"Kilimanjaro (or Kilima Njaro, which means \"shining mountain\" in Swahili), formerly Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze, is a mountain in northeastern Tanzania. Kilimanjaro is the tallest free-standing mountain rise in the world, rising 4600 meters (15,000 ft) from the base, and is the highest peak in Africa at 5,895 meters (19,340\u00A0ft). It gives a dramatic view from the surrounding plains. Almost 85% of the ice cover on Kilimanjaro disappeared from October 1912 to June 2011.\nKilimanjaro is also a strato-like volcano. It has explosive eruptions. The last major eruption was about 100,000 years ago.\nClimbing and acclimatization.\nThere are 6 routes up Kilimanjaro: Lemosho, Machame, Marangu, Umbwe, Rongai and Northern Circuit.\nSince there are big differences in height, climbers can feel Altitude sickness. 7-, 8- and 9-day routes are recommended (especially for beginners), as on them it will be easier to adapt to less oxygen in the air. The more time is spent being on the slope, the easier it is to acclimatize.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swahili_language","surface_form":"Swahili","offset":64},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":111},{"uri":"Tanzania","surface_form":"Tanzania","offset":136},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":227},{"uri":"Ft","surface_form":"ft","offset":242},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":288},{"uri":"Altitude_sickness","surface_form":"Altitude sickness","offset":778}]}
