{"id":45924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_tundra","text":"Alpine tundra is a type of geological terrain. It is to be found at high enough altitude at any latitude on Earth. Alpine tundra lacks trees. The lower parts do not have permafrost. Because of this they are generally better drained than permafrost soils. Alpine tundra changes to subalpine forests below the tree line.\nBecause alpine tundra is in many different widely separated regions of the Earth, there is no animal species found in all areas of alpine tundra.\nSome animals of alpine tundra environments include the Kea parrot, marmot, Mountain goats, chinchilla, pika, golden eagle and snow leopard. Plants include mosses, lichens and poor grasses. Some dwarf trees like birch and alder grow in tundras.\nTemperatures and rainfall.\nAlpine tundra is very cold with summer temperatures on average below 10\u00A0\u00B0C. All types of tundra are classified as a desert.\nGeographic position of tundras.\nTundras are mainly found in northern areas such as Siberia and the north of Canada.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":27},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":38},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":80},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":96},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":108},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":135},{"uri":"Permafrost","surface_form":"permafrost","offset":170},{"uri":"Subalpine","surface_form":"subalpine","offset":280},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":290},{"uri":"Tree_line","surface_form":"tree line","offset":308},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":379},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":413},{"uri":"Kea","surface_form":"Kea","offset":520},{"uri":"Marmot","surface_form":"marmot","offset":532},{"uri":"Mountain_goat","surface_form":"Mountain goat","offset":540},{"uri":"Chinchilla","surface_form":"chinchilla","offset":556},{"uri":"Pika","surface_form":"pika","offset":568},{"uri":"Golden_eagle","surface_form":"golden eagle","offset":574},{"uri":"Snow_leopard","surface_form":"snow leopard","offset":591},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":943},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":968}]}
