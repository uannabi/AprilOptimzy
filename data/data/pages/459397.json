He was also a member of the North London-based rock band Killing Floor, founded in 1968.\nRod de'Ath was born in Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire.

However, he made an appearance a few months after Rory Gallagher's death to prove he was alive.\nRod de'Ath died after a long illness on 1 August 2014 in London, England, aged 64.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Welsh_people","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":76},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":82},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":87},{"uri":"Record_producer","surface_form":"record producer","offset":100},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":159},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":165},{"uri":"Rory_Gallagher","surface_form":"Rory Gallagher","offset":175},{"uri":"Drummer","surface_form":"drummer","offset":223},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Irish","offset":280},{"uri":"Lou_Martin","surface_form":"Lou Martin","offset":304},{"uri":"Keyboardist","surface_form":"keyboardist","offset":331},{"uri":"North_London","surface_form":"North London","offset":372},{"uri":"Rock_band","surface_form":"rock band","offset":391},{"uri":"Killing_Floor","surface_form":"Killing Floor","offset":401},{"uri":"Saundersfoot","surface_form":"Saundersfoot","offset":456},{"uri":"Pembrokeshire","surface_form":"Pembrokeshire","offset":470},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":520},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":562},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":575},{"uri":"Coma","surface_form":"coma","offset":608},{"uri":"Obituary","surface_form":"obituaries","offset":663},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":828},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":836}]}
