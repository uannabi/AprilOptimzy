{"id":459411,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition","text":"The British Antarctic Expedition 1907\u201309 was also called the Nimrod Expedition. It was the first of three expeditions to the Antarctic led by Ernest Shackleton. The purpose of the journey was to reach the South Pole. They did not reach the South Pole. They had to turn back, 180.6 kilometers (112.2 miles) away from their destination. This was much nearer the Pole than anyone else had come. The group was also the first to climb Mount Erebus.\nThe group returned as heroes. Shackleton received many awards. These included a knighthood from King Edward VIII. Three years later, a group led by Roald Amundsen was first to arrive at the South Pole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expeditions","offset":106},{"uri":"Antarctic","surface_form":"Antarctic","offset":125},{"uri":"Ernest_Shackleton","surface_form":"Ernest Shackleton","offset":142},{"uri":"South_Pole","surface_form":"South Pole","offset":205},{"uri":"Mount_Erebus","surface_form":"Mount Erebus","offset":430},{"uri":"Knight_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"knighthood","offset":524},{"uri":"King_Edward_VIII","surface_form":"King Edward VIII","offset":540},{"uri":"Roald_Amundsen","surface_form":"Roald Amundsen","offset":592}]}
