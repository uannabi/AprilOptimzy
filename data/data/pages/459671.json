{"id":459671,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinzie_Street_railroad_bridge","text":"The Chicago and North Western Railway's Kinzie Street railroad bridge (also known as the Carroll Avenue bridge) is a bascule bridge across the north branch of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, Illinois. At the time of its opening in 1908 it was the world's longest and heaviest bascule bridge.\nThe Chicago Sun-Times, the last railroad customer to the east of the bridge, moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in 2000, and the bridge has been unused since. It was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago_and_North_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Chicago and North Western Railway","offset":4},{"uri":"Bascule_bridge","surface_form":"bascule bridge","offset":117},{"uri":"Chicago_River","surface_form":"Chicago River","offset":163},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":189},{"uri":"Chicago_Sun-Times","surface_form":"Chicago Sun-Times","offset":303},{"uri":"List_of_Chicago_Landmarks","surface_form":"Chicago Landmark","offset":494}]}
