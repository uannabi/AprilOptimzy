{"id":459703,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(movie)","text":"\"Hook\" is a 1991 American fantasy-comedy movie directed by Steven Spielberg and written by James V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo. It stars Robin Williams as Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy, and Bob Hoskins as Mr. Smee. It acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie's 1911 novel \"Peter and Wendy\" focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning, a successful but unimaginative and workaholic lawyer with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two children. However, when Captain Hook, the enemy of his past, kidnaps his children, he returns to Neverland to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and becomes a better person.\nSpielberg began developing the movie in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount Pictures, which would have followed the storyline seen in the 1924 silent movie and 1953 animated Disney movie. It entered pre-production in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. Hart developed the script with director Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. It was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.\nReleased on December 11, 1991, \"Hook\" received mixed reviews, who praised the performances (particularly those of Williams and Hoffman), John Williams' musical score, and production values, but criticized the screenplay and tone. Although it was a commercial success, its box office take was lower than expected. Spielberg also later came to be disappointed with the movie. It has gained a strong cult following since its release. It was nominated in five categories at the 64th Academy Awards. It also spawned merchandise, including video games, action figures, and comic book adaptations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":17},{"uri":"Steven_Spielberg","surface_form":"Steven Spielberg","offset":59},{"uri":"James_V._Hart","surface_form":"James V.
