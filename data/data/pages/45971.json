{"id":45971,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","text":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a set of actions that should be done if a person stops breathing, or if their heart stops. The goal of CPR is to force blood and oxygen to keep flowing through the body. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive. CPR does not start a person's heart again. However, it can keep pushing blood and oxygen around the body long enough that sometimes, it can keep the body from getting damaged by not having enough oxygen.\nStatistics.\nTime is very important. Each minute that passes before CPR is started lowers the chance of survival by about ten percent. If CPR starts within the first three to five minutes, and a defibrillator is available, the chance of survival can be as high as 50%, or even 75% (That is: one out of two, or three out of four survive). In European countries, emergency services take about eight minutes or more to arrive, once they have been alerted. A victim's survival therefore largely depends on other people who are there and what they do. A quick call to emergency services, and a quick start of basic CPR, especially defibrillation, can double to triple the chance of survival - with adults and children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breathing","surface_form":"breathing","offset":94},{"uri":"Cardiac_arrest","surface_form":"heart stops","offset":117},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":158},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":168},{"uri":"Ischaemia","surface_form":"not having enough oxygen","offset":445}]}
