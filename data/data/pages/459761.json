{"id":459761,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalepsy","text":"Catalepsy is a nervous condition. The body is fixed, with rigid muscles and fixed posture. The body position does not respond to stimuli, and there is decreased sensitivity to pain.\nCauses.\nCatalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal. It may be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics such as haloperidol. It may be caused by the anaesthetic ketamine. In some cases, catalepsy may be started by an extreme emotional shock \u2013 one well known example of this was the reaction of 1968 Olympic long jump medalist Bob Beamon on finding he had broken the previous world record by over 0.5\u00A0meters (2\u00A0feet). Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rigid","surface_form":"rigid","offset":58},{"uri":"Muscles","surface_form":"muscles","offset":64},{"uri":"Posture","surface_form":"posture","offset":82},{"uri":"Stimuli","surface_form":"stimuli","offset":129},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":176},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":205},{"uri":"Parkinson%27s_disease","surface_form":"Parkinson's disease","offset":264},{"uri":"Epilepsy","surface_form":"epilepsy","offset":288},{"uri":"Cocaine","surface_form":"cocaine","offset":337},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":377},{"uri":"Anti-psychotic","surface_form":"anti-psychotic","offset":406},{"uri":"Haloperidol","surface_form":"haloperidol","offset":430},{"uri":"Ketamine","surface_form":"ketamine","offset":479},{"uri":"Emotional_shock","surface_form":"emotional shock","offset":543},{"uri":"1968_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1968 Olympic","offset":612},{"uri":"Long_jump","surface_form":"long jump","offset":625},{"uri":"Bob_Beamon","surface_form":"Bob Beamon","offset":644},{"uri":"Protein_kinase_A","surface_form":"Protein kinase A","offset":735}]}
