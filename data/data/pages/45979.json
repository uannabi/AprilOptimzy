{"id":45979,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm","text":"Logarithms or logs are a part of mathematics. They are related to exponential functions. A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation. Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.\nformula_1\nThe most common types of logarithms are common logarithms, where the base is 10, binary logarithms, where the base is 2, and natural logarithms, where the base is e \u2248 2.71828.\nHistory.\nLogarithms were first used in India in the 2nd century BC. The first to use logarithms in modern times was the German mathematician Michael Stifel (around 14871567). In 1544, he wrote down the following equations: formula_1 and formula_1. This is the basis for understanding logarithms. For Stifel, formula_1 and formula_1 had to be whole numbers. John Napier (1550\u20131617) did not want this restriction, and wanted a range for the exponents.\nAccording to Napier, logarithms express ratios: formula_1 has the same ratio to formula_1, as formula_1 to formula_1 if the difference of their logarithms matches. Mathematically: formula_1. At first, base e was used (even though the number had not been named yet). Henry Briggs proposed to use 10 as a base for logarithms, such logarithms are very useful in astronomy.\nRelationship with exponential functions.\nA logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation.\nJust as an exponential function has three parts, a logarithm has three parts as well: a base, an argument and an answer (also called power).\nIn this function, the base is 2, the argument is 3 and the answer is 8.\nIn this equation, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3.\nDifference to roots.\nAddition has one inverse operation: the subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: the division. However, exponentiation actually has \"two\" inverse operations: root and logarithm. The reason why this is the case has to do with the fact that the exponentiation is not commutative.\nUses.\nLogarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easier, because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying, and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing.\nBefore calculators became popular and common, people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The same information in a logarithm table was available on a slide rule, a tool with logarithms written on it.\nNatural logarithms.\nLogarithms to base \"e\" are called natural logarithms. The number e is nearly 2.71828, and is also called the Eulerian constant after the mathematician Leonhard Euler.\nThe natural logarithms can take the symbols formula_1 or formula_1. Some authors prefer the use of natural logarithms as formula_1, but usually mention this on preface pages.\nProperties from the definition of a logarithm.\nThe logarithm to base \"b\" of a number \"a\", is the same as the logarithm of \"a\" divided by the logarithm of \"b\". That is,\nThe results above had a small error, but this was due to the rounding of numbers.\nLogarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications.\nBefore electronic computers, logarithms were used every day by scientists. Logarithms helped scientists and engineers in many fields such as astronomy.\nBefore computers, the \"table of logarithms\" was an important tool. In 1617, Henry Briggs printed the first logarithm table. This was soon after Napier's basic invention. Later, people made tables with better scope and precision. These tables listed the values of log\"b\"(\"x\") and \"b'x\" for any number \"x\" in a certain range, at a certain precision, for a certain base \"b\" (usually \"b\" = 10). For example, Briggs' first table contained the common logarithms of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 8 digits.\nSince the function is the inverse function of log\"b\"(\"x\"), it has been called the antilogarithm. People used these tables to multiply and divide numbers. For example, a user looked up the logarithm in the table for each of two positive numbers. Adding the numbers from the table would give the logarithm of the product. The antilogarithm feature of the table would then find the product based on its logarithm.\nFor manual calculations that need precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier ways.\nMany logarithm tables give logarithms by separately providing the characteristic and mantissa of \"x\", that is to say, the integer part and the fractional part of log10(\"x\"). The characteristic of is one plus the characteristic of \"x\", and their significands are the same. This extends the scope of logarithm tables: given a table listing log10(\"x\") for all integers \"x\" ranging from 1 to 1000, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by\nNumbers are marked on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. Many engineers and scientists used slide rules until the 1970s. Scientists can work faster using a slide rule than using a logarithm table.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":33},{"uri":"Exponential_function","surface_form":"exponential functions","offset":66},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"exponentiation","offset":212},{"uri":"E_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"e","offset":474},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":526},{"uri":"Michael_Stifel","surface_form":"Michael Stifel","offset":628},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":699},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"whole number","offset":829},{"uri":"John_Napier","surface_form":"John Napier","offset":844},{"uri":"E_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"e","offset":1143},{"uri":"Henry_Briggs","surface_form":"Henry Briggs","offset":1203},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":1296},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"exponentiation","offset":1471},{"uri":"Root_(math)","surface_form":"root","offset":1971},{"uri":"Commutative","surface_form":"commutative","offset":2078},{"uri":"Slide_rule","surface_form":"slide rule","offset":2445},{"uri":"E_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"e","offset":2580},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonhard Euler","offset":2666},{"uri":"Rounding","surface_form":"rounding","offset":3086},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":3308},{"uri":"Henry_Briggs_(mathematician)","surface_form":"Henry Briggs","offset":3395},{"uri":"Common_logarithm","surface_form":"mantissa","offset":4566},{"uri":"Integer_part","surface_form":"integer part","offset":4603},{"uri":"Fractional_part","surface_form":"fractional part","offset":4624}]}
