{"id":45981,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth","text":"George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth, Jr. (February 6, 1895 \u2013 August 16, 1948) was a famous baseball player during the 1910s and 1930s in Major League Baseball. He played with the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and the Boston Braves, and hit 714 home runs in his career. Only two players, Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds, have hit more. At the beginning of his career, he was a pitcher. He is widely considered the greatest baseball player of all time.\nNicknames.\nBabe Ruth has been called by many nicknames. Some of the most common are: \"The Great Bambino\", \"The Sultan of Swat\", \"The of Clout\", \"The Titan of Terror\", and \"The King Of Crash\".\nEarly career.\nRuth learned to play baseball while growing up in Baltimore, Maryland.His first Major League Baseball (MLB) team was the Boston Red Sox. Ruth began playing as a pitcher. He had some of the best pitching statistics in baseball. The Red Sox won the World Series in 1915, 1916, and 1918.\nAt that time, there was no designated hitter rule in the American League, where the Red Sox played, so Ruth got chances to hit as a pitcher. The team realized that he was also good at hitting. In 1918, Ruth began hitting more and pitching less. Later in his career, he became an outfielder.\nRuth was becoming a star player. However, by 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee was having problems with money. In 1920, the Red Sox sold Ruth to the New York Yankees for cash. Even though the Red Sox had won several World Series in the years before this, they would not win another one until 2004. Many baseball fans believed that the Red Sox had become \"cursed\" by trading Ruth, and called this the \"Curse of the Bambino\". (When the Red Sox finally did win a World Series in 2004, they beat the Yankees in the American League Championship to get there.)\nAfter the trade.\nRuth spent most of the rest of his career with the Yankees, where he became one of the most famous players in baseball history. Ruth helped the Yankees win World Series championships in 1923, 1927, 1928, and 1932. He left the Yankees after the 1934 season and played one last season with the Boston Braves in 1935.\nIn 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, which was then a record for the most home runs in one season. The record was broken by Roger Maris in 1961 with 61 home runs.\nDeath.\nRuth died of throat cancer August 16, 1948.\nHonors.\nIn November 2018, Ruth posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump.\nCareer batting statistics.\nHe also had a.474 career on-base percentage, which is second all-time to Ted Williams'.482.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["MLB player"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":81},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":127},{"uri":"Boston_Red_Sox","surface_form":"Boston Red Sox","offset":169},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":185},{"uri":"Atlanta_Braves","surface_form":"Boston Braves","offset":211},{"uri":"Hank_Aaron","surface_form":"Hank Aaron","offset":281},{"uri":"Barry_Bonds","surface_form":"Barry Bonds","offset":296},{"uri":"Pitcher","surface_form":"pitcher","offset":365},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":485},{"uri":"Sultan","surface_form":"Sultan","offset":551},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore, Maryland","offset":696},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":893},{"uri":"Designated_hitter","surface_form":"designated hitter","offset":958},{"uri":"American_League","surface_form":"American League","offset":988},{"uri":"Outfielder","surface_form":"outfielder","offset":1210},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":1325},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":1370},{"uri":"Cash","surface_form":"cash","offset":1391},{"uri":"2004_American_League_Championship_Series","surface_form":"American League Championship","offset":1732},{"uri":"World_Series","surface_form":"World Series","offset":1949},{"uri":"Roger_Maris","surface_form":"Roger Maris","offset":2227},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":2286},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":2293},{"uri":"Posthumously","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":2348},{"uri":"Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom","surface_form":"Presidential Medal of Freedom","offset":2374},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":2419},{"uri":"Ted_Williams","surface_form":"Ted Williams","offset":2533}]}
