In this manner he was able to escape the poverty of his parents.\nAt University he studied dramatic arts or acting; he taught and directed theatre productions. During this time he met and married Joan Turner, a British ballet dancer and choreographer who worked in Chile.\nLater V\u00EDctor Jara started to write and sing songs. He began to sing songs about the life of humble and poor people in his country: peasants, factory workers, miners, abandoned children, poor women. He also dedicated music albums to people who live in the shanty towns.\nV\u00EDctor Jara tried to use his music to bring awareness about the inequality between the richest and the poorest people in society. How poor folk have a hard time acquiring the most basic things, such as food, health care, education, and housing. He also supported politicians who called for a fairer distribution of wealth to end poverty.\nIn 1973 V\u00EDctor Jara was killed by a military dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet for singing songs about social problems and social injustice. The U.S. government of Richard Nixon supported the military regime.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_28","surface_form":"September 28","offset":26},{"uri":"1932","surface_form":"1932","offset":40},{"uri":"September_15","surface_form":"September 15","offset":46},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":60},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":84},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":91},{"uri":"Peasant","surface_form":"peasant","offset":145},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"University","offset":218},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":334},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"University","offset":361},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"dramatic arts","offset":383},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":431},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":503},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":511},{"uri":"Choreography","surface_form":"choreographer","offset":529},{"uri":"Peasant","surface_form":"peasant","offset":695},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":705},{"uri":"Worker","surface_form":"worker","offset":713},{"uri":"Miner","surface_form":"miners","offset":722},{"uri":"Orphan","surface_form":"abandoned children","offset":730},{"uri":"Shanty_town","surface_form":"shanty town","offset":819},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":954},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":1035},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health care","offset":1041},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":1054},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"housing","offset":1069},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":1096},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":1162},{"uri":"Dictatorship","surface_form":"dictatorship","offset":1216},{"uri":"Augusto_Pinochet","surface_form":"Augusto Pinochet","offset":1244},{"uri":"U.S.","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":1327},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":1346}]}
