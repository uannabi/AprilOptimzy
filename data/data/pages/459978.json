{"id":459978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Barcelona_B","text":"F.C. Barcelona B is the reserve team of F.C. Barcelona. They compete in the Segunda Divisi\u00F3n B, the third division of Spanish association football, after being relegated from the Segunda Divisi\u00F3n in the 2014-15 season finishing in 22nd place.\nHistory.\nBar\u00E7a B was originally founded on 1 August 1934, as \"Societat Esportiva Industrial Espanya\". It was owned by a textile company of the same name. In 1945, the company agreed with FC Barcelona to make the club Bar\u00E7a's reserve team. They were promoted to La Liga in 1953, but decided to stay in Segunda Divisi\u00F3n. In 1956, they won promotion again, and since teams with names of companies were not allowed, they changed their name to CD Condal.\nIn 1970, they decided to merge Condal with Atl\u00E8tic Catalunya and formed Barcelona Atl\u00E8tic. They reached Segunda Divisi\u00F3n B and Segunda Divisi\u00F3n after 1974. In 1991, Barcelona Atl\u00E8tic was then renamed FC Barcelona B. In 2008, they were named Barcelona Atl\u00E8tic once again when Pep Guardiola brought them to Segunda Divisi\u00F3n B, and then once again named FC Barcelona B when they were promoted to Segunda Divisi\u00F3n.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"FC_Barcelona","surface_form":"F.C.
