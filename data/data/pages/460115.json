This was the location of Chicago's first three taverns, its first hotel, Sauganash Hotel, its first ferry, its first drug store, its first church, and the first bridges across the Chicago River.\nThe Wolf Point is said to be named after a Native American Chief whose name meant to wolf in English, but other theories exist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago_River","surface_form":"Chicago River","offset":75},{"uri":"Near_North_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Near North Side","offset":113},{"uri":"Loop%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Loop","offset":130},{"uri":"Near_West_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Near West Side","offset":140},{"uri":"Community_areas","surface_form":"community areas","offset":155},{"uri":"Tavern","surface_form":"tavern","offset":304},{"uri":"Sauganash_Hotel","surface_form":"Sauganash Hotel","offset":330},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":357}]}
