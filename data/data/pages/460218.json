Each of them is a part of a different high school clique. Being stereotypes, they all have some kind of problems with their parents, friends or school teachers. They forgot who they really are, because they hide behind masks. Spending Saturday together, they are starting to know each other better and then they realize that first of all each of them is a person. Unfortunately, other people do not see their personalities, they only see stereotypes. This fact makes them tired of life and entangled in thoughts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":31},{"uri":"Coming_of_age","surface_form":"coming of age","offset":40},{"uri":"Comedy-drama","surface_form":"comedy-drama","offset":54},{"uri":"John_Hughes_(producer)","surface_form":"John Hughes","offset":105},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":133},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":141},{"uri":"Emilio_Estevez","surface_form":"Emilio Estevez","offset":166},{"uri":"Anthony_Michael_Hall","surface_form":"Anthony Michael Hall","offset":182},{"uri":"Judd_Nelson","surface_form":"Judd Nelson","offset":204},{"uri":"Molly_Ringwald","surface_form":"Molly Ringwald","offset":217},{"uri":"Ally_Sheedy","surface_form":"Ally Sheedy","offset":236},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":251},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":263},{"uri":"Paul_Gleason","surface_form":"Paul Gleason","offset":287},{"uri":"John_Kapelos","surface_form":"John Kapelos","offset":321},{"uri":"Cleaner","surface_form":"cleaner","offset":341},{"uri":"Clique","surface_form":"clique","offset":600},{"uri":"Stereotype","surface_form":"stereotype","offset":614}]}
