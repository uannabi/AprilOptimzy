They can be worn by males or females. Despite their name, they do not have feline characteristics.\nSome people consider catsuits to be fetish items.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Garment","surface_form":"garment","offset":37},{"uri":"Torso","surface_form":"torso","offset":61},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":126},{"uri":"Latex","surface_form":"latex","offset":144},{"uri":"Feline","surface_form":"feline","offset":348}]}
