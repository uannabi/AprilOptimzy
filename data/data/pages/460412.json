{"id":460412,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scagliola","text":"Scagliola (from the Italian \"scaglia\", meaning \"chips\"), is an artificial way of imitating marble and other precious material. It is a decorative building material.\nStucco columns, sculptures, and other architectural elements can be made by scagliola. It came into fashion in 17th-century Tuscany.\nScagliola is a composite substance made from selenite, glue and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones. The material may be veined with colours and stuck on to a core, or patterns may be carved into a prepared scagliola matrix. The pattern is then then filled with the coloured, plaster-like composite. Then it is polished with flax oil for brightness, and wax for protection. The whole thing gives a richness of colour not easy to get in natural marbles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":20},{"uri":"Marble","surface_form":"marble","offset":91},{"uri":"Stucco","surface_form":"Stucco","offset":165},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":181},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architectural","offset":203},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":289},{"uri":"Composite_material","surface_form":"composite substance","offset":313},{"uri":"Selenite_(mineral)","surface_form":"selenite","offset":343},{"uri":"Glue","surface_form":"glue","offset":353},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":370},{"uri":"Flax_oil","surface_form":"flax oil","offset":644}]}
