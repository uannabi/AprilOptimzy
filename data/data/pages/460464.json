{"id":460464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem","text":"e=\"preserve\">The prime number theorem is a theorem from number theory. Prime numbers are not distributed evenly across the number range. The theorem formalizes the idea that the probability of hitting a prime number between 1 and a given number becomes smaller, as numbers grow. This probability is about n/ln(n), where ln(n) is the natural logarithm function. This means that the probability of hitting a prime number with 2n digits is about half as likely than with n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (ln\u00A0101000 \u2248 2302.6), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (ln\u00A0102000 \u2248 4605.2). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first \"N\" integers is roughly ln(\"N\").\nFifteen-year old Carl Friedrich Gauss suspected that there was a link between prime numbers and logarithms in 1793. Adrien-Marie Legendre also suspected such a link in 1798. Jacques Hadamard and Charles-Jean de La Vall\u00E9e Poussin proved the prime number theorem in 1896, over a century after Gauss.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":43},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":56},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"Prime number","offset":71},{"uri":"Probability","surface_form":"probability","offset":178},{"uri":"Natural_logarithm","surface_form":"natural logarithm","offset":333},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":351},{"uri":"Digit","surface_form":"digit","offset":427},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gauss","offset":829},{"uri":"Logarithm","surface_form":"logarithm","offset":908},{"uri":"Adrien-Marie_Legendre","surface_form":"Adrien-Marie Legendre","offset":928},{"uri":"Jacques_Hadamard","surface_form":"Jacques Hadamard","offset":986},{"uri":"Charles-Jean_de_La_Vall%C3%A9e_Poussin","surface_form":"Charles-Jean de La Vall\u00E9e Poussin","offset":1007}]}
