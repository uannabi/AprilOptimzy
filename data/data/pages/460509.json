{"id":460509,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs","text":"e=\"preserve\">The War on Drugs is a term that is commonly used to describe the government initiative to end drug usage across the United States. The campaign started in the early 1970s and was given a major focus under the Reagan Administration of the 1980s. The War on Drugs continued into the 1990s and 2000s, but lacked the priority the US Government had given it under Reagan. It was made popular by President Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.\nThe War on Drugs lead to the capture of many drug dealers and ended many drug dealers in the United States. The Drug Policy Alliance said that the United States had spent $51 billion every year on the War on Drugs.\nThe War on Drugs also lead to the creation of the saying \"Just Say No\" which was created by Ronald Reagan's wife and First Lady Nancy Reagan. It was created to prevent teenagers doing drugs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":129},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":403},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":413},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":428},{"uri":"George_H._W._Bush","surface_form":"George H.
