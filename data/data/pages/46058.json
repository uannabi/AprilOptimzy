{"id":46058,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterodactyloidea","text":"Pterodactyloidea is the suborder of short-tailed pterosaurs. Their fossil record starts in the middle Jurassic. They became extinct in the T extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period. \"Pterodactylus\", \"Pteranodon\" and \"Quetzalcoatlus\" are in this suborder.\nIn 2014 remains of the earliest pterodactyloid was found in China. It is called \"Kryptodrakon\". Its minimum age was 162.7 million years ago (mya). This is about five million years older than any previously known confirmed specimens.\nRecent work shows that the group had more variety at the end of the Cretaceous than was thought earlier. In the early 2010s, several new pterosaur taxa were discovered dating to the late Cretaceous. These finds include some small sized pterosaur species.\nAt the end of the Cretaceous period, the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, which made all non-avian and most avian dinosaurs, as well as many other animals, extinct. The pterosaurs seem to have gone extinct in this event.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":49},{"uri":"Fossil_record","surface_form":"fossil","offset":67},{"uri":"Middle_Jurassic","surface_form":"middle Jurassic","offset":95},{"uri":"T_extinction_event","surface_form":"T extinction event","offset":139},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":176},{"uri":"Pterodactylus","surface_form":"Pterodactylus","offset":196},{"uri":"Pteranodon","surface_form":"Pteranodon","offset":213},{"uri":"Quetzalcoatlus","surface_form":"Quetzalcoatlus","offset":230},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":328},{"uri":"Kryptodrakon","surface_form":"Kryptodrakon","offset":349},{"uri":"Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event","surface_form":"Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event","offset":797}]}
