{"id":4606,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language","text":"The Greek language is an Indo-European language. It is the official language of Greece (Hellas) and Cyprus.\nIt was first spoken in Greece and was also once spoken along the coast of Asia Minor (now a part of Turkey) and in southern Italy. It was also widely used in Western Asia and Northern Africa at one time. In Greek, the language is called \u0395\u03BB\u03BB\u03B7\u03BD\u03B9\u03BA\u03AC (ellinik\u00E1).\nGreeks write their language using the Greek alphabet. The Latin alphabet (used to write English and many other languages) came from the Greek alphabet. Many other alphabets around the world also came from the Greek one.\nGreek has an unbroken history of being a written language for over 3,000 years. This is longer than any other Indo-European language spoken today. This history is often divided into three parts, ancient Greek, medieval Greek, and modern Greek. The years 330-1453 are called medieval Greek because that's the time of the Byzantine Empire.\nOver 15 million people in the world speak Greek now. These speakers mostly live in Greece and Cyprus. There are also people in other countries around the world who speak the language. This is largely because people left Greece and emigrated, meaning they moved to other countries. Countries like the United States and Australia have a large Greek diaspora.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European language","offset":25},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":59},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":80},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":100},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":182},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":232},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":404},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":430},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":454},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":781},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Empire","offset":906},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1224},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1242},{"uri":"Diaspora","surface_form":"diaspora","offset":1271}]}
