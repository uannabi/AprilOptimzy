He also stole fire from Zeus and gave it to humans. As punishment, Zeus had Prometheus chained to a mountain. Every day an eagle would come and eat his liver. Prometheus is immortal, so he never died, and his liver grew back every night. But he still felt great pain.\nAfter a long time, Zeus sent his son Heracles to free Prometheus by breaking the chains which held him.\nAeschylus wrote a play about Prometheus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Titan_(mythology)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":17},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":26},{"uri":"Iapetus","surface_form":"Iapetus","offset":60},{"uri":"Asia_(mythology)","surface_form":"Clymene","offset":72},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":143},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":153},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":173},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":184},{"uri":"Chain","surface_form":"chain","offset":216},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":229},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":245},{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":252},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":281},{"uri":"Immortal","surface_form":"immortal","offset":302},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":391},{"uri":"Heracles","surface_form":"Heracles","offset":434},{"uri":"Aeschylus","surface_form":"Aeschylus","offset":501}]}
