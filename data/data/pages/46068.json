{"id":46068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In music, the pitch of a note means how high or low the note is. In physics, it is measured in a unit called Hertz. A note that is vibrating at 261\u00A0Hz will be caused by sound waves that vibrate at 261 times a second. This will be Middle C on the piano.\nNot all musical instruments make notes of a certain pitch. Many percussion instruments like drums, triangles and cymbals are instruments used for rhythms. They do not play tunes because they have no definite pitch (although often a definite pitch can just be heard when listening carefully.)\nSome musicians have a sense of absolute pitch or pitch perfect. This means that they always know what note is being played, even without comparing it to another note. Having a sense of absolute pitch does not necessarily make someone a good musician, although it can be very useful.\nThere is evidence to suggest that well-known composers of classical music, such as Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach, had developed and perhaps even mastered their sense of pitch.\nPitch is often confused with frequency. Frequency is used as a scientific means for measuring and changing sound and its possible pitches, though pitch is used to describe a more psychological.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":16},{"uri":"Note_(music)","surface_form":"note","offset":38},{"uri":"High","surface_form":"high","offset":53},{"uri":"Low","surface_form":"low","offset":61},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":81},{"uri":"Unit","surface_form":"unit","offset":110},{"uri":"Hertz","surface_form":"Hertz","offset":122},{"uri":"Sound_wave","surface_form":"sound wave","offset":182},{"uri":"Vibrate","surface_form":"vibrate","offset":199},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":222},{"uri":"Middle_C","surface_form":"Middle C","offset":243},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":259},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":274},{"uri":"Percussion","surface_form":"percussion","offset":330},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":358},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":365},{"uri":"Cymbal","surface_form":"cymbal","offset":379},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":412},{"uri":"Tune","surface_form":"tune","offset":438},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":563},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":886},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":899},{"uri":"Haydn","surface_form":"Haydn","offset":924},{"uri":"Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":931},{"uri":"Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart","offset":942},{"uri":"Bach","surface_form":"Bach","offset":954},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":1051},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific","offset":1085},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychological","offset":1201}]}
