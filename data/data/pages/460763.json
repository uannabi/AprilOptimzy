{"id":460763,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle","text":"In physics, the superposition principle states that if there are two or more stimuli at a given point in time, the response will be the result of adding all the responses. This only applies to linear systems. Since many systems can be modelled as linear systems, the principle has many applications in physics and engineering.\nSuperposition principle: The principle states that the total force on a given charge is the vector of the individual forces exerted on the given charge by all other charges. Each individual force between any two charges is calculated from Coulomb's law tattoos and is not affected by the presence of other charges","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":3},{"uri":"Linear_system","surface_form":"linear system","offset":193},{"uri":"Model","surface_form":"model","offset":235},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":314}]}
