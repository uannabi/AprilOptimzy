{"id":46093,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vegetation means the plant life of a region or the plant community. It means all ground cover by plants, and is the main element of the biosphere. When you say \"vegetation\" you do not think of any species composition, life forms, structure, spatial extent, \"naturalness\", or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. That is meant by \"flora\" which refers exclusively to species composition.\n\"Vegetation\" can refer to a wide range of spatial scales. Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are meant by the term \"vegetation\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant_community","surface_form":"plant community","offset":64},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":110},{"uri":"Biosphere","surface_form":"biosphere","offset":149},{"uri":"Form","surface_form":"form","offset":236},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":243},{"uri":"Space_(physics)","surface_form":"spatial","offset":254},{"uri":"Flora_(plants)","surface_form":"flora","offset":366},{"uri":"Redwood_forest","surface_form":"redwood forest","offset":489},{"uri":"Mangrove_stand","surface_form":"mangrove stand","offset":514},{"uri":"Sphagnum_bog","surface_form":"sphagnum bog","offset":531},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":546},{"uri":"Weed","surface_form":"weed","offset":575},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":589},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":614},{"uri":"Lawn","surface_form":"lawn","offset":626}]}
