{"id":46121,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba","text":"\"Amoeba\" (plural = amoebae) is a well known genus of unicellular organism, a protist. One of its most common species, the \"Amoeba Proteus\", is about 0.2 to 0.3\u00A0mm large. The amoeba was first discovered by August Von Rosenhof in 1757. It is a genus of protozoa that moves with \"false feet\", called pseudopodia.\nThe amoeba is a member of a whole group of amoeboid eukaryotic protists called Amoebozoa. They are heterotrophs, eating bacteria and other protists.\nThe pseudopodia (false feet) are extensions of the organism's cell membrane. They are used by the amoeba for phagocytosis (active food/nutrient intake) and motility (self-propelled movement).\nLife.\nAmoebae are often found within freshwater, typically on vegetation in decay in still or slow moving water, or in the benthic zone of some lakes. However, they are common organisms of study because it is easy to keep them in a laboratory. They are used to study \"protozoa\" and to demonstrate cell structure and function.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":44},{"uri":"Unicellular_organism","surface_form":"unicellular organism","offset":53},{"uri":"Protist","surface_form":"protist","offset":77},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":109},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":242},{"uri":"Protozoa","surface_form":"protozoa","offset":251},{"uri":"Pseudopodia","surface_form":"pseudopodia","offset":297},{"uri":"Eukaryota","surface_form":"eukaryotic","offset":362},{"uri":"Amoebozoa","surface_form":"Amoebozoa","offset":389},{"uri":"Heterotroph","surface_form":"heterotroph","offset":409},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":430},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"cell membrane","offset":521},{"uri":"Phagocytosis","surface_form":"phagocytosis","offset":568},{"uri":"Motility","surface_form":"motility","offset":615},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":688},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":713},{"uri":"Decay","surface_form":"decay","offset":727},{"uri":"Benthic","surface_form":"benthic","offset":774},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":883},{"uri":"Protozoa","surface_form":"protozoa","offset":919},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cell","offset":948}]}
