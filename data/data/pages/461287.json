{"id":461287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgend","text":"Bridgend (;, meaning \"Head of the Bridge on the Ogmore\") is a town in Bridgend County Borough in Wales, west of Cardiff and east of Swansea. The river crossed by the original bridge, which gave the town its name, is the River Ogmore, but the River Ewenny also passes to the south of the town.\nHistorically a part of Glamorgan, Bridgend has grown a lot since the early 1980s - the United Kingdom Census in 2001 found a population of 39,429, and the 2011 census found that the Bridgend Local Authority had a population of 139,200 up from 128,700 in 2001. This 8.2% rise was the largest in Wales except for Cardiff. The town is undergoing redevelopment, with the town centre pedestrianised and a new business park opened.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bridgend_County_Borough","surface_form":"Bridgend County Borough","offset":70},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":97},{"uri":"Cardiff","surface_form":"Cardiff","offset":112},{"uri":"Swansea","surface_form":"Swansea","offset":132}]}
