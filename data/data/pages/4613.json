{"id":4613,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH","text":"pH is a scale of acidity from 0 to 14. It tells how acidic or alkaline a substance is.\nMore acidic solutions have lower pH. More alkaline solutions have higher pH. Substances that aren't acidic or alkaline (that is, neutral solutions) usually have a pH of 7.\nAcids have a pH that is less than 7. Alkalis have a pH that is greater than 7.\npH is a measure of the concentration of protons (H+) in a solution. S.P.L. S\u00F8rensen introduced this concept in the year 1909. The p stands for the German \"potenz\", meaning power or concentration, and the H for the hydrogen ion (H+).\n[H+] indicates the concentration of H+ ions (also written [H3O+], the equal concentration of hydronium ions), measured in moles per litre (also known as molarity).\nwhere formula_1 indicates the activity of H+ ions. But, this equation in most cases provides the same value as the more common formula, so in introductory chemistry the previous equation is given as the definition of pH.\nMost substances have a pH in the range of 0 to 14, although \"extremely\" acidic or alkaline substances may have pH < 0, or pH > 14.\nAlkaline substances have, instead of hydrogen ions, a concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-).\npH indicators.\nCertain dyes change colour depending on whether they are in an acid solution or an alkaline solution. pH indicator is a chemical compound added in small amounts to a solution so the pH (acidity or basicity) of the solution can be seen. The pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions (H3O+) or hydrogen ions (H+). Normally, the indicator causes the colour of the solution to change depending on the pH.\nTypical indicators are phenolphthalein, methyl orange, methyl red, bromothymol blue, and thymol blue. They each change colour at different points on the pH scale, and can be used together as a universal indicator.\nAnother way is to use litmus paper, which is based on a natural pH indicators. The paper can tell you how strong the chemical is, whether it is a stronger acid or a stronger base.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scale","surface_form":"scale","offset":8},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":52},{"uri":"Alkali","surface_form":"alkali","offset":62},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"Acid","offset":259},{"uri":"Alkali","surface_form":"Alkali","offset":296},{"uri":"Concentration","surface_form":"concentration","offset":361},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":378},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":396},{"uri":"S._P._L._S%C3%B8rensen","surface_form":"S.P.L.
