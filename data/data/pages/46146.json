{"id":46146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therizinosaurus","text":"Therizinosaurus was a huge herbivorous theropod dinosaur from the end of the Cretaceous period.\nNew, well-preserved finds such as \"Alxasaurus\" in 1993 and \"Beipiaosaurus\" in 1996 provided details about the bird-like pelvis, feet and skulls of primitive members. This helped confirm they belonged to the same group of theropod dinosaurs as \"Therizinosaurus\" and that therizinosaurs were, more specifically, advanced, herbivorous maniraptoran theropods.\nTheir fossils were first found in the late 1940s in Asia. They were named in 1954 after more bones were found. It was a thought to be a carnivore and herbivore; it had very long claws - they were about 3 ft long.\nPaleobiology.\nThe feeding habits of \"Therizinosaurus\" are unknown, since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate its diet. However, like other therizinosaurs, it was probably primarily herbivorous.\nThere are multiple possible functions that could have been served by the claws of \"Therizinosaurus\", such as defense against predators (e.g. the contemporary \"Tarbosaurus\") and in intraspecific fighting, such as fighting for territory or for mating, or to pull leafy tree branches towards its mouth. The claws may have served all these functions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":27},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":39},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":48},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":77},{"uri":"Alxasaurus","surface_form":"Alxasaurus","offset":131},{"uri":"Beipiaosaurus","surface_form":"Beipiaosaurus","offset":156},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":216},{"uri":"Feet","surface_form":"feet","offset":224},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":233},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":458},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":504},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":545},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":588},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivore","offset":602},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":868},{"uri":"Tarbosaurus","surface_form":"Tarbosaurus","offset":1040}]}
