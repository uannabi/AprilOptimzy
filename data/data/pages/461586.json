He was better known by his ring name Gorilla Monsoon. He is known for his professional wrestling run as a super-heavyweight main eventer. He is also known for being the voice of the World Wrestling Federation as a commentator and backstage manager during the 1980s and 1990s. He also served as the on-screen WWF President.\nIn honor of Monsoon, the staging area behind the entrance curtain at an event, a position which Monsoon established and where he could often be found during WWF shows late in his career, is named the Gorilla Position. On June 9, 1994, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Jim Ross.\nDeath.\nOn October 6, 1999, Monsoon died of heart failure brought on by complications of diabetes at his Willingboro Township, New Jersey home. In a tribute which aired on WWF television after his death, McMahon described Marella as \"one of the greatest men I have ever known.\" Monsoon's death was acknowledged by WCW commentator Tony Schiavone (at Bobby Heenan's request) on the October 11, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, even though Monsoon had never worked for WCW. Heenan said: \"Gorilla will be sadly missed. Now he was one big tough man. He was a decent honest man. And we're all gonna miss him very much. And you know the pearly gates in heaven? It's now gonna be called 'the Gorilla position.' Goodbye, my friend.\" He was interred next to his son, Joey Marella, at Lakeview Memorial Park in Cinnaminson, New Jersey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":74},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestler","offset":83},{"uri":"Sports_commentator","surface_form":"play-by-play commentator","offset":106},{"uri":"Ring_name","surface_form":"ring name","offset":171},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"World Wrestling Federation","offset":326},{"uri":"WWE_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"WWE Hall of Fame","offset":727},{"uri":"Jim_Ross","surface_form":"Jim Ross","offset":747},{"uri":"Willingboro_Township%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Willingboro Township, New Jersey","offset":861},{"uri":"Tony_Schiavone","surface_form":"Tony Schiavone","offset":1086},{"uri":"Bobby_Heenan","surface_form":"Bobby Heenan","offset":1105},{"uri":"WCW_Monday_Nitro","surface_form":"WCW Monday Nitro","offset":1164},{"uri":"Cinnaminson_Township%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Cinnaminson","offset":1557},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":1570}]}
