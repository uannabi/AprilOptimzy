{"id":4616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore","text":"An omnivore is an animal whose species gets its energy and nutrients from a diet made up foods that include plants, animals, algae, fungi and bacteria.\nMany omnivores change their eating habits during their life cycle. They are sometimes called \"life-history omnivores\", because they are only omnivores if their whole life is considered.\nSome species, such as grazing waterfowl like geese, are known to eat mainly animals at one stage of their lives, but plants at another. Also, many insects, such as the beatle family Meloidae, eat animal tissue when they are larvae, but eat plant matter after they mature.\nAnimal types.\nAll of these animals are omnivores, but have different feeding behaviors and favorite foods. Being omnivores gives these animals more food security in stressful times. It also makes it easier for them to live in less consistent environments; (those that change along with the season, for example).\nThe hominidae, including humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans, are typically omnivores.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":31},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":48},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"nutrient","offset":59},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":76},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":108},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":116},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":125},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungi","offset":132},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":142},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":343},{"uri":"Waterfowl","surface_form":"waterfowl","offset":368},{"uri":"Geese","surface_form":"geese","offset":383},{"uri":"Meloidae","surface_form":"Meloidae","offset":520},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":562},{"uri":"Behavior","surface_form":"behavior","offset":687},{"uri":"Favorite","surface_form":"favorite","offset":701},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":852},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":900},{"uri":"Hominidae","surface_form":"hominidae","offset":926},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":947},{"uri":"Chimpanzee","surface_form":"chimpanzee","offset":955},{"uri":"Orangutan","surface_form":"orangutan","offset":972}]}
