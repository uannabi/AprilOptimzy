If his age is true, he would have been the oldest living man, the oldest living person in Africa, the oldest person in Nigeria, and the 10th oldest living person. Sadela is also known for being married at 107 years old to a 30 years old woman.\nRev. Samuel Akinbode Sadela was a remarkable man of God who was instrumental to almost all the Christian revivals which happened in Nigeria. He put an amazing 82 years into the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was the founder of the Gospel Apostolic Church.\nHis first school was St. Paul's Primary School in Ifon Osun. In 1914, he was forced to drop out of school and start working. In 1918, he returned to school. He went to the University of London in 1925. After graduation, he became a priest.\nBefore the news of his death, the high priest claimed that Samuel was in the hospital and that he was receiving medical treatment. Apparently he died on the premises of his church in Lagos, Nigeria. On 26 August 2014, he died at the claimed age of 114 from natural causes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ifon_Osun","surface_form":"Ifon Osun","offset":33},{"uri":"Lagos","surface_form":"Lagos","offset":62},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":91},{"uri":"Oldest_people","surface_form":"unverified claimant","offset":114},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":252},{"uri":"Ifon_Osun","surface_form":"Ifon Osun","offset":725},{"uri":"University_of_London","surface_form":"University of London","offset":847},{"uri":"Lagos","surface_form":"Lagos","offset":1098},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":1105}]}
