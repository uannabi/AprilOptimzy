{"id":46169,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfe_Castle","text":"Corfe Castle is a small village and ruined castle dating back to the 11th century. It is in a gap in the Purbeck Hills, five miles south of Wareham, in Dorset, England.\nThe oldest surviving structure on the castle site dates to the 11th century, although there are good reasons to suppose that there was a stronghold there before the Norman Conquest. Edward the Martyr was killed at the site on March 18, 978.\nThe castle was besieged in the English Civil War. After it was captured it was partly demolished (slighted).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ruins","surface_form":"ruined","offset":36},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":43},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":69},{"uri":"Purbeck_Hills","surface_form":"Purbeck Hills","offset":105},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":125},{"uri":"Wareham%2C_Dorset","surface_form":"Wareham","offset":140},{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":152},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":160},{"uri":"Stronghold","surface_form":"stronghold","offset":306},{"uri":"Norman_Conquest","surface_form":"Norman Conquest","offset":334},{"uri":"Edward_the_Martyr","surface_form":"Edward the Martyr","offset":351},{"uri":"Slighting","surface_form":"slighted","offset":508}]}
