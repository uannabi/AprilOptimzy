{"id":46177,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major","text":"Sir John Major (born 29 March 1943) is a British politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1997. He served as a member of the Cabinet under Margaret Thatcher as Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1987\u20131989), Foreign Secretary (1989) and Chancellor of the Exchequer (1989\u20131990).\nEarly life and career.\nMajor was born at St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children in St Helier, London, in England and left school at the age of 16. He became a Conservative councillor in 1968. At the 1979 general election, Major was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdonshire (Huntingdon after 1983).\nAfter holding several cabinet positions, Major was elected to replace Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister and party leader. On taking office, he saw British action in the Gulf War (1991) and his party's narrow re-election in the 1992 general election.\nAfter this, the Conservatives under Major became unpopular because of the \"Black Wednesday\" stock market crash in late 1992 and how they became divided over the issue of European Union. Beaten at the 1997 general election, Major stood down as Prime Minister for Tony Blair of the Labour Party, and was replaced as Conservative leader by William Hague. He stood down as an MP at the 2001 general election.\nMajor has so far declined a life peerage on standing down from Parliament.\nPersonal life.\nMajor married Norma Johnson (now (Dame) Norma Major) on 3 October 1970. She was a teacher, and a member of the Young Conservatives. They became engaged after only ten days. They have two children; a son, James, and a daughter, Elizabeth. They have a holiday home on the coast of north Norfolk, near Weybourne.\nHe is a keen follower of cricket, motor racing, and also a supporter of Chelsea Football Club.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":49},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister of the United Kingdom","offset":68},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Leader","offset":109},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative Party","offset":123},{"uri":"Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Cabinet","offset":190},{"uri":"Margaret_Thatcher","surface_form":"Margaret Thatcher","offset":204},{"uri":"Chief_Secretary_to_the_Treasury","surface_form":"Chief Secretary to the Treasury","offset":225},{"uri":"Foreign_Secretary","surface_form":"Foreign Secretary","offset":270},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","surface_form":"Chancellor of the Exchequer","offset":299},{"uri":"St_Helier_Hospital_and_Queen_Mary%27s_Hospital_for_Children","surface_form":"St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children","offset":381},{"uri":"St_Helier","surface_form":"St Helier","offset":442},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":453},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":464},{"uri":"Councillor","surface_form":"councillor","offset":531},{"uri":"1979_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"1979 general election","offset":558},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":599},{"uri":"Huntingdonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","surface_form":"Huntingdonshire","offset":629},{"uri":"Huntingdon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","surface_form":"Huntingdon","offset":646},{"uri":"Gulf_War","surface_form":"Gulf War","offset":841},{"uri":"1992_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"1992 general election","offset":899},{"uri":"Black_Wednesday","surface_form":"Black Wednesday","offset":997},{"uri":"Stock_market","surface_form":"stock market","offset":1014},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":1092},{"uri":"1997_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"1997 general election","offset":1122},{"uri":"Tony_Blair","surface_form":"Tony Blair","offset":1184},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":1202},{"uri":"William_Hague","surface_form":"William Hague","offset":1259},{"uri":"2001_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"2001 general election","offset":1304},{"uri":"Life_peer","surface_form":"life peer","offset":1355},{"uri":"British_House_of_Commons","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":1390},{"uri":"Dame","surface_form":"Dame","offset":1451},{"uri":"Norma_Major","surface_form":"Norma Major","offset":1457},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":1499},{"uri":"Young_Conservatives","surface_form":"Young Conservatives","offset":1528},{"uri":"Norfolk","surface_form":"Norfolk","offset":1702},{"uri":"Weybourne%2C_Norfolk","surface_form":"Weybourne","offset":1716},{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":1752},{"uri":"Motor_racing","surface_form":"motor racing","offset":1761},{"uri":"Chelsea_F.C.","surface_form":"Chelsea Football Club","offset":1799}]}
