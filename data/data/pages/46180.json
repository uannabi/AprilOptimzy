A round is a type of canon, but in a round each voice, when it finishes, can start at the beginning again so that the piece can go \u201Cround and round\u201D. Perhaps the most well-known canon is the Pachelbel Canon written by Johann Pachelbel.\nDifferent types of canon.\nThere are different kinds of canon. Canons can be described according to distances between the entries of the voices. If the second voice starts one bar (one measure) after the first voice, this is called a \u201Ccanon at the bar\u201D. If it starts after only half a bar, it is called a \u201Ccanon at the half-bar\u201D. It is even possible to have very close canons, e.g. \u201Ccanon at the quaver (eighth note)\u201D. Olivier Messiaen wrote a 3 part canon at the quaver in his \" for violin and piano. The pianist\u2019s right hand (playing chords), his left hand and the violinist are the three parts.\nCanons can also be described according to the intervals between two voices. If one voice starts on a C and the next voice starts the same tune on an F above this is a \u201Ccanon at the fourth\u201D (because the interval (distance) from C to F is called a \u201Cperfect fourth\u201D). If the second voice has the tune upside down (inversion) this is called \u201Ccanon in inversion\u201D. If the second voice has the tune at half the speed (each note being twice as long) this is a \u201Ccanon in augmentation\u201D or an \u201Caugmented canon\u201D. The opposite is a \u201Ccanon in diminution\u201D.\n\u201CStrict canon\u201D means a canon where each voice imitates the first voice exactly all the way through the piece. If this does not happen (i.e. if it starts off as a canon but then becomes freer) it is \u201Cfree canon\u201D. A canon may start off sounding like a fugue, but fugues have their own form and rules.\nCanons in the history of music.\nCanons were already popular in the 14th century when composers enjoyed writing music for several voices in which each voice has a share of melody (this is called polyphonic music.) Composers like Guillaume de Machaut wrote canonic music. His \"Sanz cuer m\u2019en vois\" is a three-part canon in which each part has different words.\nProbably the greatest writer of canons in the eighteenth century was Johann Sebastian Bach. Many of his organ works have canons. He wrote a famous set of \"Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"\" which have several canons at different intervals and inversions. He probably wrote this to show young composers how to write good canons. Bach also wrote a work called the \"Musical Offering\" which has what he calls a \u201Ccanon per augmentationem contrario motu\u201D (canon in augmentation and contrary motion i.e. backwards) as well as a \u201Ccanon per tonos\u201D. This last one is a modulating canon which means that the tune changes key. This is hard to compose well so that it sounds good because when the first voice has just changed key the other one is still catching up in the other key.\nBach was a great master at writing canons and other very complicated musical forms. After 1750 composers became less interested in writing music which was all polyphonic, although many composers still showed an interest in counterpoint. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote canons and even Romantic composers like Schumann and Brahms showed an interest. C\u00E9sar Franck wrote a canon for the fourth movement of his Sonata for Violin and Piano. It is quite easy to hear this canon, because the violin plays the tune an octave higher than the piano, and the piano holds on to a long note every other bar while the violin catches up.\nIn the 20th century composers such as Schoenberg who wrote serial music were fond of canons. Modern composers like Pierre Boulez have written rhythmic canons: canons in which, for example, the rhythm of one part is the retrograde (backwards) version of another.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canon","surface_form":"canon","offset":58},{"uri":"Voice_(polyphony)","surface_form":"voices","offset":88},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrumental","offset":99},{"uri":"Round_(music)","surface_form":"round","offset":183},{"uri":"Pachelbel%27s_Canon","surface_form":"Pachelbel Canon","offset":372},{"uri":"Johann_Pachelbel","surface_form":"Johann Pachelbel","offset":399},{"uri":"Bar_(music)","surface_form":"bar","offset":592},{"uri":"Olivier_Messiaen","surface_form":"Olivier Messiaen","offset":835},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":900},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":911},{"uri":"Interval_(music)","surface_form":"intervals","offset":1060},{"uri":"Interval_(music)","surface_form":"interval","offset":1216},{"uri":"Inversion_(music)","surface_form":"inversion","offset":1325},{"uri":"Fugue","surface_form":"fugue","offset":1806},{"uri":"14th_century","surface_form":"14th century","offset":1922},{"uri":"Polyphonic","surface_form":"polyphonic","offset":2049},{"uri":"Guillaume_de_Machaut","surface_form":"Guillaume de Machaut","offset":2083},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":2282},{"uri":"Canonic_Variations_on_%26quot%3BVom_Himmel_hoch_da_komm%27_ich_her%26quot%3B","surface_form":"Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"","offset":2368},{"uri":"Musical_Offering","surface_form":"Musical Offering","offset":2599},{"uri":"Modulation_(music)","surface_form":"modulating","offset":2795},{"uri":"Counterpoint","surface_form":"counterpoint","offset":3229},{"uri":"Joseph_Haydn","surface_form":"Haydn","offset":3243},{"uri":"Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart","offset":3250},{"uri":"Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":3261},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":3297},{"uri":"Robert_Schumann","surface_form":"Schumann","offset":3321},{"uri":"Johannes_Brahms","surface_form":"Brahms","offset":3334},{"uri":"C%C3%A9sar_Franck","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar Franck","offset":3361},{"uri":"Sonata_for_Violin_and_Piano","surface_form":"Sonata for Violin and Piano","offset":3419},{"uri":"Octave","surface_form":"octave","offset":3522},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":3642},{"uri":"Arnold_Schoenberg","surface_form":"Schoenberg","offset":3673},{"uri":"Serialism","surface_form":"serial","offset":3694},{"uri":"Pierre_Boulez","surface_form":"Pierre Boulez","offset":3750}]}
