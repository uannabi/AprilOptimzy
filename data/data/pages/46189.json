{"id":46189,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_(music)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Modulation, in music, means that the music changes key. A piece of music might, for example, be \"in the key of C major\" (meaning that it uses the notes of a C major scale, and the C sounds like the \"home key\" or \"tonic\" as it is called in music theory). Then it could modulate to G major so that the G now feels like the home key and the notes of a G major scale are used (the Fs will be F sharps).\nModulations like the one above are very common, because G is closely related to C (it is the 5th note in a C major scale: the \"dominant\"). A modulation to the subdominant (4th note of the scale) is also common (e.g. from C major to Fmajor). Music often modulates to the relative minor (e.g. C major to A minor).\nA modulation that goes to a key whose tonic is not part of the original key is called a \"chromatic modulation\". Modulating from C major to A flat major would be a chromatic modulation because A flat is not a note in the C major scale.\nMost pieces of music will modulate, especially if they are long pieces. It gives the music variety and helps to give it shape: the farther away from the tonic it goes the more tension there is. When the music eventually returns to the original key it feels like a homecoming.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":28},{"uri":"Tonality","surface_form":"key","offset":64},{"uri":"Piece","surface_form":"piece","offset":71},{"uri":"Note_(music)","surface_form":"notes","offset":159},{"uri":"Scale_(music)","surface_form":"scale","offset":178},{"uri":"Music_theory","surface_form":"music theory","offset":252},{"uri":"Relative_minor","surface_form":"relative minor","offset":682},{"uri":"Chromatic","surface_form":"chromatic","offset":813}]}
