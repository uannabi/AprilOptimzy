{"id":46194,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key","text":"e=\"preserve\">When a piece of music is in a major key, the relative minor means the minor key which has the same key signature. It can be found by taking the sixth note of the first scale and playing a minor scale starting on that note. For example: in C major the sixth note is an A. Therefore, A minor is the relative minor of C major (C major and A minor share the same key signature: no sharps or flats).\nC major is called the relative major of A minor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":29},{"uri":"Mode_(music)","surface_form":"major","offset":43},{"uri":"Mode_(music)","surface_form":"minor","offset":83},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":112},{"uri":"Note_(music)","surface_form":"note","offset":163},{"uri":"Scale_(music)","surface_form":"scale","offset":181}]}
