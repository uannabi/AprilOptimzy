{"id":46199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Electrolysis is a scientific way of 'splitting' substances. Electrolysis means 'electric-splitting' and involves the separation of substances through an electric current.\nMetals above carbon in the reactivity series (potassium, sodium, lithium, calcium, magnesium and aluminium) are extracted by electrolysis.\nUses.\nElectrolysis is used in the mining industry to split reactive metals from their ores after they are taken from the ground. Electroplating is also used to plate (cover) things with metal because it costs less than using, for example, solid gold to make jewellery.\nMany beauty shops use electrolysis or electrology to remove hair. This is done by \"electrocuting\" the hair so it splits along its root.\nElectrolysis makes the anions (negative ion<nowiki/>s) go to the anode (positive electrode) and the cations (positive ions) go to the cathode (negative electrode). So, for example, oxygen would go to the anode and iron would go to the cathode.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific","offset":31},{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":61},{"uri":"Metals","surface_form":"Metals","offset":184},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":197},{"uri":"Reactivity_series","surface_form":"reactivity series","offset":211},{"uri":"Potassium","surface_form":"potassium","offset":230},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":241},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":249},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":258},{"uri":"Magnesium","surface_form":"magnesium","offset":267},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":281},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":357},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":391},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":409},{"uri":"Electroplating","surface_form":"Electroplating","offset":452},{"uri":"Jewellery","surface_form":"jewellery","offset":581},{"uri":"Beauty_shop","surface_form":"beauty shop","offset":597},{"uri":"Electrology","surface_form":"electrology","offset":630},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":652},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":722},{"uri":"Anion","surface_form":"anion","offset":751},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":768},{"uri":"Anode","surface_form":"anode","offset":793},{"uri":"Cation","surface_form":"cation","offset":828},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":846},{"uri":"Cathode","surface_form":"cathode","offset":862}]}
