{"id":46210,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin","text":"A coffin (also known as a casket) is a box used to keep dead bodies, either for burial or after cremation.\nThe word comes ultimately from Greek \"kophinos\", a basket. In English, the word was not used in a funeral sense until the 1500s.\nAny box used to bury the dead in is a coffin.\nThe main distinction between a coffin and a casket is the shape. A casket regularly has 6 \u2013 8 sides while coffins have a rectangular shape.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Box","surface_form":"box","offset":39},{"uri":"Corpse","surface_form":"dead bodies","offset":56},{"uri":"Burial","surface_form":"burial","offset":80},{"uri":"Cremation","surface_form":"cremation","offset":96},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":138},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":169},{"uri":"Funeral","surface_form":"funeral","offset":205},{"uri":"1500s","surface_form":"1500s","offset":229}]}
