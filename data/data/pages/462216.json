The show ran from September 11, 1993 until 1995. The show was centered around a temple that was \"filled with lost treasures protected by mysterious Mayan temple guards\". It was hosted by Kirk Fogg and Dee Bradley Baker voiced Olmec, a talking Olmec Head that \"knows the secrets behind each of the treasures in his temple\". There were six teams of two children (one boy and one girl) and they competed to retrieve one of the historical artifacts that was in the temple by performing both physical stunts and by answering questions that were based on history, mythology, and geography.\nThe show was taped at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. In 1995, the show won a CableACE award for Best Game Show Special or Series and was also nominated for Art Direction in a Comedy or Music Special or Series. In a 2007 poll held by the Springfield, Illinois State Journal-Register, ten percent of the respondents said that Legends of the Hidden Temple was their \"favorite 'old school' Nickelodeon show.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":37},{"uri":"Game_show","surface_form":"game show","offset":63},{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":73},{"uri":"Nickelodeon","surface_form":"Nickelodeon","offset":158},{"uri":"Dee_Bradley_Baker","surface_form":"Dee Bradley Baker","offset":372},{"uri":"Olmec_colossal_heads","surface_form":"Olmec Head","offset":414},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":720},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythology","offset":729},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":744},{"uri":"Nickelodeon_Studios","surface_form":"Nickelodeon Studios","offset":777},{"uri":"Universal_Studios_Florida","surface_form":"Universal Studios","offset":800},{"uri":"Orlando%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Orlando","offset":821},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":830},{"uri":"Springfield%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Springfield","offset":1023},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":1036},{"uri":"The_State_Journal-Register","surface_form":"State Journal-Register","offset":1045}]}
