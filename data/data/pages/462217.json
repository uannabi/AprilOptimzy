{"id":462217,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Punjabis","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 82nd Punjabis were a regiment of soldiers of the old British Indian Army. The regiment was started in Madras, in British India in 1788. Later, it started to take in more soldiers from the Punjab and NWFP regions, so the regiment was renamed 'Punjabis' in 1903, and later became the 82nd Punjabis. Then, after some time, they were part of the 'First Punjab Regiment'.\nBetween 1788 and 1947, this regiment fought many wars and won many battles. In 1947, when India and Pakistan became independent countries after partition, the 82nd (or First Punjab) became part of the Punjab Regiment of the Pakistan Army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Indian_Army","surface_form":"British Indian Army","offset":70},{"uri":"Madras","surface_form":"Madras","offset":119},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":130},{"uri":"Punjab_(British_India)","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":205},{"uri":"NWFP","surface_form":"NWFP","offset":216},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":484},{"uri":"Pakistan_Army","surface_form":"Pakistan Army","offset":608}]}
