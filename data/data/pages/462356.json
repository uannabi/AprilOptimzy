There are four ventricles in a human brain.\nThis is the ventricular system: it continues as the central canal of the spinal cord. The ventricles are interconnected: this allows the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.\nThe ventricle lining is an epithelium-like membrane. The CSF is produced by cells of this lining.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":46},{"uri":"Cerebrospinal_fluid","surface_form":"cerebrospinal fluid","offset":66},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":210},{"uri":"Epithelium","surface_form":"epithelium","offset":330}]}
