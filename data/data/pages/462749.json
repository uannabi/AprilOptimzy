{"id":462749,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Azar","text":"e=\"preserve\">Betty Schrampfer Azar is an expert on teaching and learning English grammar. She wrote the \"Azar Grammar Series\" for students of English as a second or foreign language. This series is used by teachers and students all over the world. It has been very popular for more than thirty years.\nAzar thinks teaching grammar is a good way to teach a new language. Students should start by learning about grammar, and that will help them learn all language skills \u2014 speaking, listening, writing, and reading.\nThere are four editions of Azar's book series. Stacy A. Hagen became Azar's co-author 2006, so now the books are called the \"Azar-Hagen Grammar Series\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":81},{"uri":"English_as_a_second_language","surface_form":"English as a second or foreign language","offset":142}]}
