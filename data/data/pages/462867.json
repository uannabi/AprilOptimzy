It was made from parts of Chester County, Lancaster County, and Philadelphia County.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County_(United_States)","surface_form":"county","offset":31},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":53},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":67},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":91},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":136},{"uri":"Reading%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Reading","offset":151},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":192},{"uri":"Berkshire","surface_form":"Berkshire","offset":210},{"uri":"William_Penn","surface_form":"William Penn","offset":226},{"uri":"Estate_(house)","surface_form":"estates","offset":258},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviated","offset":286},{"uri":"Lancaster_County%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Lancaster County","offset":387},{"uri":"Petition","surface_form":"petition","offset":417},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":487},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigrant","offset":494},{"uri":"Chester_County%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Chester County","offset":586},{"uri":"Lancaster_County%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Lancaster County","offset":602},{"uri":"Philadelphia_County%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Philadelphia County","offset":624}]}
