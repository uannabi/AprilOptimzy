He had the nickname, \"the Peaceable\", but was a stronger king than his elder brother, Edwy. He took the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia from Edwy in 958.\nEdgar was recognized as king north of the Thames by Mercian nobles in 958, and officially took the throne when Edwy died in October 959. Immediately Edgar recalled Dunstan from exile and made him successively Bishop of Worcester, then of London and finally Archbishop of Canterbury.\nEdgar is regarded as a Saint by the Catholic church.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Edmund_I_of_England","surface_form":"Edmund I of England","offset":71},{"uri":"Edwy","surface_form":"Edwy","offset":178},{"uri":"Northumbria","surface_form":"Northumbria","offset":208},{"uri":"Mercia","surface_form":"Mercia","offset":224},{"uri":"Saint_Dunstan","surface_form":"Dunstan","offset":413},{"uri":"Archbishop_of_Canterbury","surface_form":"Archbishop of Canterbury","offset":506},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"Saint","offset":555},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":568}]}
