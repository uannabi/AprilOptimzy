{"id":463124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide","text":"The Michelin Guide (French: \"Guide Michelin\") is a series of annual guide books published by the French company \"Michelin\" for over a century. It lists good restaurants and hotels.\nThe term normally refers to the Michelin Red Guide, the oldest and best-known European hotel and restaurant reference guide. A team of experts gives Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments. The gain or loss of a star can have a big effect on the success of a restaurant.\nThe guides cover western Europe in detail, major cities in the USA, Japan and Hong Kong Macau. \"Michelin\" was and is a tyre company, and the guides were originally meant to be packed in the car as you went touring through France. That is why they cover hotels as well as restaurants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Guide_book","surface_form":"guide book","offset":68},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":97},{"uri":"Restaurants","surface_form":"restaurants","offset":157},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":173},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"European","offset":259},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"western Europe","offset":490},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":536},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":541},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":551},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":561},{"uri":"Tyre","surface_form":"tyre","offset":592}]}
