It was held on April 27, 2014 at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the ninth Sacrifice event that TNA held and was also the second event in TNA's 2014 pay-per-view schedule.\nThere were eight matches on the card with three main events. The main events saw Eric Young defeat Magnus to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Gunner defeat James Storm in \"I Quit\" match and Bobby Roode defeat Bully Ray in a Tables match.\nSacrifice gained mixed reviews with James Caldwell, from Pro Wrestling Torch, saying \"there were probably three or four independent shows this weekend with more star-power in their main events\". Caldwell also gave the Bobby Roode-Bully Ray match minus two stars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":23},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":46},{"uri":"Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling","surface_form":"Total Nonstop Action Wrestling","offset":72},{"uri":"Impact_Zone","surface_form":"Impact Zone","offset":147},{"uri":"Orlando%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Orlando","offset":162},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":171},{"uri":"TNA_Sacrifice","surface_form":"Sacrifice","offset":197},{"uri":"Eric_Young","surface_form":"Eric Young","offset":375},{"uri":"Magnus_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Magnus","offset":393},{"uri":"TNA_World_Heavyweight_Championship","surface_form":"TNA World Heavyweight Championship","offset":414},{"uri":"Gunner_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Gunner","offset":450},{"uri":"James_Storm","surface_form":"James Storm","offset":464},{"uri":"Bobby_Roode","surface_form":"Bobby Roode","offset":498},{"uri":"Mark_LoMonaco","surface_form":"Bully Ray","offset":517}]}
