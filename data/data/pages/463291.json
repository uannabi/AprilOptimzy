{"id":463291,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith","text":"Herman Hollerith (February 29, 1860 \u2013 November 17, 1929) was an American statistician and inventor. He developed a mechanical tabulator based on punched cards. This tabulated (put into tables) the data from millions of people. He was the founder of the \"Tabulating Machine Company\" that later became IBM.\nHollerith is known as the father of modern machine data processing. The start of automatic data processing systems came with his invention. Programs and data were put in to computer by punched cards in the 1950s and 60s.\nHollerith began working for the United States Census Bureau in the year he filed his first patent application. Titled \"Art of Compiling Statistics\", it was filed on September 23, 1884; U.S. Patent 395,782 was granted on January 8, 1889.\nHollerith built machines under contract for the Census Office, which used them to tabulate the 1890 United States Census in only one year. The previous 1880 United States Census had taken eight years.\nHollerith started his \"Tabulating Machine Company\" in 1896. Major census bureaus around the world leased his equipment and purchased his cards, as did major insurance companies. Hollerith's machines were used for censuses in England, Italy, Germany, Russia, Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, and again in the 1900 United States Census. To make his system work, he invented the first automatic card-feed mechanism and the first keypunch (that is, a punch operated by a keyboard); a skilled operator could punch 200\u2013300 cards per hour. He also invented a tabulator.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":64},{"uri":"Statistician","surface_form":"statistician","offset":73},{"uri":"Inventor","surface_form":"inventor","offset":90},{"uri":"Tabulating_machine","surface_form":"tabulator","offset":126},{"uri":"Punched_card","surface_form":"punched card","offset":145},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"data","offset":197},{"uri":"IBM","surface_form":"IBM","offset":300},{"uri":"History_of_computing_hardware","surface_form":"machine data processing","offset":348},{"uri":"Data_processing","surface_form":"data processing","offset":396},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"Programs","offset":445},{"uri":"United_States_Census_Bureau","surface_form":"United States Census Bureau","offset":558},{"uri":"1890_United_States_Census","surface_form":"1890 United States Census","offset":858},{"uri":"1880_United_States_Census","surface_form":"1880 United States Census","offset":915},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1189},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1198},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1205},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1214},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":1222},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1231},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1239},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1247},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":1255},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":1268},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":1282},{"uri":"1900_United_States_Census","surface_form":"1900 United States Census","offset":1312},{"uri":"Keypunch","surface_form":"keypunch","offset":1430},{"uri":"Keyboard_(computer)","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":1471},{"uri":"Tabulating_machine","surface_form":"tabulator","offset":1556}]}
