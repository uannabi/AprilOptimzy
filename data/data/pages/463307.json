{"id":463307,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartering_Acts","text":"e=\"preserve\">Quartering Act is the name given to two Acts of the British Parliament in the 18th century. These acts ordered the local governments of the American colonies to give British soldiers housing and food when they needed it.\nEach of the Quartering Acts was an amendment to the Mutiny Act. The Parliament renewed them each year. The Acts were passed to solve the problems of the French and Indian War. They caused tension between the Thirteen Colonies and the government in London. These problems led, in part, to the Revolutionary War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parliament_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"British Parliament","offset":65},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"American colonies","offset":153},{"uri":"Amendment","surface_form":"amendment","offset":269},{"uri":"Mutiny_Acts","surface_form":"Mutiny Act","offset":286},{"uri":"French_and_Indian_War","surface_form":"French and Indian War","offset":387},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"Thirteen Colonies","offset":442},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":482},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"Revolutionary War","offset":526}]}
