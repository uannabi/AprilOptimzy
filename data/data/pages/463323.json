{"id":463323,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popigai_crater","text":"=\"preserve\">Popigai crater is an impact crater in Siberia, Russia. It was formed when a meteor struck the Earth about 35 million years ago.\nThere are many diamonds under the crater. The diamonds were made when the high pressure of the meteor hitting the ground compressed the graphite. Even though there are many diamonds, mining is not considered to be profitable. That is because the mine is located in a place far from people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Impact_crater","surface_form":"impact crater","offset":33},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":50},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":59},{"uri":"Meteor","surface_form":"meteor","offset":88},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":155},{"uri":"Graphite","surface_form":"graphite","offset":276},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":323}]}
