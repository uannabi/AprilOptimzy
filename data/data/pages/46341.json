{"id":46341,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism","text":"=\"preserve\">Anarcho-syndicalism is a form of anarchism. It sees labour unions as something which will cause revolutionary change. This change will give freedom and equality to the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists want to get rid of the wage system and capitalism. They believe this leads to class divisions and inequality.\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action can bring about change. Anarcho-syndicalists do not take part in indirect action, like electing a representative to a government position.\nAnarcho-syndicalism played an important role in the Spanish Civil War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anarchism","surface_form":"anarchism","offset":45},{"uri":"Labour_union","surface_form":"labour union","offset":64},{"uri":"Revolutionary","surface_form":"revolutionary","offset":108},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"freedom","offset":152},{"uri":"Equal","surface_form":"equal","offset":164},{"uri":"Wage_system","surface_form":"wage system","offset":233},{"uri":"Capitalism","surface_form":"capitalism","offset":249},{"uri":"Class_division","surface_form":"class division","offset":288},{"uri":"Direct_action","surface_form":"direct action","offset":359},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"electing","offset":460},{"uri":"Representative","surface_form":"representative","offset":471},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":491},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":564}]}
