They are a large cosmopolitan family of \"true bugs\" or Hemiptera.\nThey are almost all terrestrial ambush predators. Most members of the family are easy to recognise: they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build and formidable curved proboscis. Large specimens should be handled with care, if at all, because they may defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cosmopolitan_distribution","surface_form":"cosmopolitan","offset":51},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":64},{"uri":"Hemiptera","surface_form":"true bugs","offset":75},{"uri":"Hemiptera","surface_form":"Hemiptera","offset":89},{"uri":"Ambush_predator","surface_form":"ambush predator","offset":132},{"uri":"Proboscis","surface_form":"proboscis","offset":271}]}
