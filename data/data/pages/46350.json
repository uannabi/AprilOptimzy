{"id":46350,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTC","text":"XTC was an English rock band. Its members were: Andy Partridge, Colin Moulding, Barry Andrews, and Terry Chambers. XTC started in 1976. They had their biggest success in the late 1970s and most of the 1980s. XTC was best known in their home country of England, but they had some fame in other countries like the United States. Their 2 biggest hits in the U.S. are \"Dear God\" and \"The Mayor Of Simpleton\". Some of XTC's other hit songs include \"Making Plans For Nigel\", \"Senses Working Overtime\", and \"Are You Receiving Me\".\nXTC made a total of 13 studio albums. Their last album came out in 2000 and they broke up in 2005. Andy Partridge, the band's singer, says he doesn't think XTC will ever get back together.\nOne interesting thing about XTC is that they almost never did live concerts since 1982. The reason for that is because Andy Partridge sometimes got very nervous performing on stage in front of thousands of people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":11},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":19},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":312}]}
