{"id":46359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roh_Tae-woo","text":"Roh Tae-woo (born December 4, 1932 in Daegu), is the sixth President of South Korea (1988\u20131993). He was a former Korean general and politician. A member of the Hanahoi, Roh was the hand-picked successor of the ex-general and president Chun Doo-hwan. This caused large pro-democracy rallies in Seoul and other cities in 1987. Roh agreed to hold democratic presidential elections, making himself a candidate for the next election. The opposition split the votes between Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung (both of whom later became presidents). This made Roh the first elected president after the time that the military ruled the country.\nRoh's rule was notable for hosting the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and for his foreign policy of nordpolitik.\nIn 1993, Roh's successor Kim Young-sam led an anti-corruption campaign that saw Roh and Chun Doo-hwan on trial for bribery. The two former presidents were later charged with mutiny and treason for their part in the 1979 coup and the 1980 Gwangju Riot.\nBoth were found to be guilty in August 1996 of treason, mutiny and corruption. Chun was sentenced to death, later changed to life imprisonment. Roh's 22 1/2-year jail sentence was reduced to 17 years. Both were released from prison in early 1998, pardoned by then-President Kim Dae-jung.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Daegu","surface_form":"Daegu","offset":38},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":59},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":72},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"general","offset":120},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":132},{"uri":"Hanahoi","surface_form":"Hanahoi","offset":160},{"uri":"Successor","surface_form":"successor","offset":193},{"uri":"Chun_Doo-hwan","surface_form":"Chun Doo-hwan","offset":235},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":272},{"uri":"Rally","surface_form":"rallies","offset":282},{"uri":"Seoul","surface_form":"Seoul","offset":293},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":368},{"uri":"Candidate","surface_form":"candidate","offset":396},{"uri":"Opposition","surface_form":"opposition","offset":433},{"uri":"Kim_Young-sam","surface_form":"Kim Young-sam","offset":468},{"uri":"Kim_Dae-jung","surface_form":"Kim Dae-jung","offset":486},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":605},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":624},{"uri":"1988_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"Seoul Olympics","offset":672},{"uri":"Foreign_policy","surface_form":"foreign policy","offset":707},{"uri":"Nordpolitik","surface_form":"nordpolitik","offset":725},{"uri":"Kim_Young-sam","surface_form":"Kim Young-sam","offset":763},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":789},{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"campaign","offset":800},{"uri":"Chun_Doo-hwan","surface_form":"Chun Doo-hwan","offset":826},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"trial","offset":843},{"uri":"Bribery","surface_form":"bribery","offset":853},{"uri":"Mutiny","surface_form":"mutiny","offset":912},{"uri":"Treason","surface_form":"treason","offset":923},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_of_December_Twelfth","surface_form":"coup","offset":958},{"uri":"Gwangju_Riot","surface_form":"Gwangju Riot","offset":976},{"uri":"Guilty","surface_form":"guilty","offset":1012},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":1057},{"uri":"Life_imprisonment","surface_form":"life imprisonment","offset":1115},{"uri":"Jail","surface_form":"jail","offset":1152},{"uri":"Pardon","surface_form":"pardon","offset":1237},{"uri":"Kim_Dae-jung","surface_form":"Kim Dae-jung","offset":1264}]}
