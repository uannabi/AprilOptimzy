{"id":463626,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_wire_and_cable","text":"A copper wire is a single electrical conductor made of copper. It can be insulated or uninsulated. A copper cable is a group of two or more copper wires bundled together in a single sheath or jacket. Copper wire and cable is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. It has been useful ever since telegraphs and electromagnets were invented.\nCopper is the most widely used conductor in many kinds of electrical wiring. Copper has the lowest resistance to the flow of electricity of all non-precious metals. Electrical wiring in buildings is the most important market for the copper industry. About half of all copper mined is used to make electrical wire and cable conductors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electrical_conductor","surface_form":"electrical conductor","offset":26},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":55},{"uri":"Insulator_(electricity)","surface_form":"insulated","offset":73},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":147},{"uri":"Cable","surface_form":"cable","offset":216},{"uri":"Power_generation","surface_form":"power generation","offset":233},{"uri":"Power_transmission","surface_form":"power transmission","offset":251},{"uri":"Power_distribution","surface_form":"power distribution","offset":271},{"uri":"Telecommunications","surface_form":"telecommunications","offset":291},{"uri":"Electrical_circuit","surface_form":"electronics circuitry","offset":311},{"uri":"Telegraph","surface_form":"telegraph","offset":409},{"uri":"Electromagnet","surface_form":"electromagnet","offset":424},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electrical","offset":512},{"uri":"Electrical_resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":553},{"uri":"Precious_metal","surface_form":"precious metal","offset":602},{"uri":"Buildings","surface_form":"buildings","offset":640},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":672},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mined","offset":729}]}
