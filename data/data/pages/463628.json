{"id":463628,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triphyophyllum","text":"\"Triphyophyllum\" is a carnivorous plant genus with only one species \"Triphyophyllum peltatum\". It is native to tropical western Africa, in Sierra Leone and Liberia, growing in tropical rainforests.\nIt is a liana, with a three-stage lifecycle, each with a different shaped leaf, as indicated by its Greek name. In the first stage, \"T. peltatum\" has simple lance-like leaves, and looks nondescript. It then develops long, glandular leaves, like those of the related \"Drosophyllum\". These sticky leaves capture insects. The plant then enters its adult liana form, with short non-carnivorous leaves on a long twining stem.\n\"T. peltatum\" is cultivated in only three botanical gardens: Abidjan, Bonn, and W\u00FCrzburg. It is extremely rare in private collections.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivorous_plant","surface_form":"carnivorous plant","offset":22},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":40},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":60},{"uri":"Native","surface_form":"native","offset":101},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":128},{"uri":"Sierra_Leone","surface_form":"Sierra Leone","offset":139},{"uri":"Liberia","surface_form":"Liberia","offset":156},{"uri":"Tropical_rainforest","surface_form":"tropical rainforest","offset":176},{"uri":"Liana","surface_form":"liana","offset":206},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaf","offset":272},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":298},{"uri":"Drosophyllum","surface_form":"Drosophyllum","offset":465},{"uri":"Abidjan","surface_form":"Abidjan","offset":680},{"uri":"Bonn","surface_form":"Bonn","offset":689},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrzburg","surface_form":"W\u00FCrzburg","offset":699}]}
