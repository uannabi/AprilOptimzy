He entered politics after Japanese occupation ended in 1945, with Syngman Rhee being his mentor. In 1948, Yun was made mayor of Seoul by Rhee. A year later, he was made the Minister of Commerce and Industry. Soon, he started to disagree with Rhee's authoritarian policies. He then served as president of the Red Cross Society, before being elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he founded the opposition Democratic Party along with several others.\nAfter Rhee's government was ousted by a student-led pro-democracy uprising, Yun was elected president on August 13, 1960. He was merely a figurehead, as South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system in response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhee's regime. After Park Chung Hee's coup in 1961, he stayed on briefly to provide legitimacy to the regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. He opposed Park's authoritarian rule and ran for president twice in 1963 and 1967, losing each time. After receiving suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities, Yun retired from politics in 1980 and focused primarily on cultural activities until his death from diabetes and high blood pressure. He died in 1990.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":13},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":65},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":78},{"uri":"Yun_Chi-ho","surface_form":"Yun Chi-ho","offset":144},{"uri":"Asan","surface_form":"Asan","offset":171},{"uri":"South_Chungcheong","surface_form":"South Chungcheong","offset":177},{"uri":"University_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"University of Edinburgh","offset":228},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":272},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":287},{"uri":"Military_occupation","surface_form":"occupation","offset":296},{"uri":"Syngman_Rhee","surface_form":"Syngman Rhee","offset":327},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":380},{"uri":"Seoul","surface_form":"Seoul","offset":389},{"uri":"Minister_of_Commerce_and_Industry","surface_form":"Minister of Commerce and Industry","offset":434},{"uri":"Authoritarian","surface_form":"authoritarian","offset":510},{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policies","offset":524},{"uri":"Red_Cross_Society","surface_form":"Red Cross Society","offset":569},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(South_Korea)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":683},{"uri":"Park_Chung_Hee","surface_form":"Park Chung Hee","offset":997},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":1401},{"uri":"High_blood_pressure","surface_form":"high blood pressure","offset":1414}]}
