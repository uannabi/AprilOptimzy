It dates from Mughal times.\nHistory.\nThe Royal Mint (where coins were made) of the Mughal Empire or \"Taxal\", was here. The gate was named for that.\nPresent.\nToday, there is no mint here. There is a very famous shoe market, Sheikhupurian Bazaar. People can go there and try \"Desi\" (local) foods like \"Siri Paya\" and many types of sweets.\nThe world-famous Heera Mandi red light area is also in this area. This was made famous in Rudyard Kipling's novel, \"Kim\" (published 1901).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gate","surface_form":"gate","offset":46},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":63},{"uri":"Walled_city","surface_form":"walled city","offset":72},{"uri":"Lahore","surface_form":"Lahore","offset":87},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":102},{"uri":"Mint_(money)","surface_form":"Mint","offset":159},{"uri":"Mughal_Empire","surface_form":"Mughal Empire","offset":195},{"uri":"Siri_Paya","surface_form":"Siri Paya","offset":412},{"uri":"Heera_Mandi","surface_form":"Heera Mandi","offset":466},{"uri":"Rudyard_Kipling","surface_form":"Rudyard Kipling","offset":539},{"uri":"Kim_(book)","surface_form":"Kim","offset":565}]}
