Since then, the band has released four studio albums. Their most successful album to date is \"All Killer, No Filler.\" The album had the single \"Fat Lip\" which did very well, making it the band's most successful single. The second single off the album, \"In Too Deep\", also did well.\nThey often perform more than 300 times in a single year. That is why they are known for their long and worldwide tours, most of which last more than a year. So far, all of the Sum 41 albums have done very well in Canada. Sum 41 has received many awards and nominations. They have been nominated for seven Juno Awards (the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy Award), winning twice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_punk","surface_form":"rock punk","offset":49},{"uri":"Ajax%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Ajax, Ontario","offset":69},{"uri":"Deryck_Whibley","surface_form":"Deryck Whibley","offset":121},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"lead vocals","offset":137},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":150},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboards","offset":158},{"uri":"Cone_McCaslin","surface_form":"Cone McCaslin","offset":170},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":185},{"uri":"Backing_vocalist","surface_form":"backing vocals","offset":198},{"uri":"Steve_Jocz","surface_form":"Steve Jocz","offset":219},{"uri":"Drum_kit","surface_form":"drums","offset":231},{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion","offset":238},{"uri":"Dave_Baksh","surface_form":"Dave Baksh","offset":325},{"uri":"Lead_guitar","surface_form":"lead guitar","offset":339},{"uri":"Island_Records","surface_form":"Island Records","offset":415},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":470},{"uri":"All_Killer%2C_No_Filler","surface_form":"All Killer, No Filler","offset":525},{"uri":"Fat_Lip","surface_form":"Fat Lip","offset":575},{"uri":"In_Too_Deep_(Sum_41_song)","surface_form":"In Too Deep","offset":684}]}
