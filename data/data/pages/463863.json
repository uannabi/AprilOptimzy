He turned to radical pacifism and opposed all forms of warfare and aggression. This is why he declined the Crafoord Prize in 1988.\nIn 1966 he was awarded the Fields Medal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":24},{"uri":"Saint-Girons%2C_Ari%C3%A8ge","surface_form":"Saint-Girons, Ari\u00E8ge","offset":64},{"uri":"Algebraic_geometry","surface_form":"algebraic geometry","offset":130},{"uri":"Institut_des_Hautes_%C3%89tudes_Scientifiques","surface_form":"Institut des Hautes \u00C9tudes Scientifiques","offset":180},{"uri":"Pacifism","surface_form":"pacifism","offset":338},{"uri":"Crafoord_Prize","surface_form":"Crafoord Prize","offset":424},{"uri":"Fields_Medal","surface_form":"Fields Medal","offset":475}]}
