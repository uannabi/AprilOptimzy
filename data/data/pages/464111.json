According to a legend, this was the name of a beautiful dancing-girl. She fell in love with the Mughal prince Selim (who later became the Emperor Jahangir). But the prince's father, the old Emperor Akbar, did not like the girl. So he had the girl arrested and punished. She died and was buried near a bazaar or market. Later, when prince Selim became Emperor he named the bazaar after her. Today, there is an old tomb near there. Jahangir built it in 1615. People say this is the tomb of the real Anarkali, but no one is certain. Another famous tomb near Anarkali Bazaar is Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aibak's tomb\nThe bazaar today.\nToday, the Anarkali Bazaar is one of the best shopping areas in all of South Asia.
