{"id":464139,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock","text":"The Glock pistol is a series of polymer-framed semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and produced by Glock Ges.m.b.H. in Deutsch-Wagram, Austria. It entered Austrian Armed Forces and police service by 1982. Different models use different ammunition.\nThere was resistance from the market to accept a \"plastic gun\", but this was overcome. Glock pistols have become the company's most profitable line of products, with 65% of the market share of handguns for United States law enforcement agencies.They also supply many national armed forces and security agencies around the world. Glocks are also popular firearms amongst civilians in the U.S, for recreational and competition shooting, and for home or self defense.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pistol","surface_form":"pistol","offset":10},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":32},{"uri":"Semi-automatic_firearm","surface_form":"semi-automatic pistols","offset":47},{"uri":"Deutsch-Wagram","surface_form":"Deutsch-Wagram","offset":125},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":141},{"uri":"Austrian","surface_form":"Austrian","offset":161},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammunition","offset":242},{"uri":"Profit","surface_form":"profit","offset":386},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":460},{"uri":"Law_enforcement","surface_form":"law enforcement","offset":474}]}
