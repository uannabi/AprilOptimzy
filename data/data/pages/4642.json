{"id":4642,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square","text":"A square is a shape with four equal sides and four corners that are all right angles (90 degrees). The diagonals of a square also cross at right angles. The angle between any diagonal and a side of a square is 45 degrees. A square has rotational symmetry of four. It has four lines of regular symmetry. A square with vertices \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" can be written as formula_1.\nA square is a type of rectangle with all sides of equal length. However, while a square is a type of rectangle and rhombus, the opposite does not need to be true.\nA square is also the 2-dimensional analogue of a cube.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":14},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angle","offset":72},{"uri":"Diagonal","surface_form":"diagonal","offset":103},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetry","offset":246},{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangle","offset":399},{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":433},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":589}]}
