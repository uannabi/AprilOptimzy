{"id":46429,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Lord (Laird in some Scottish contexts) is a person who has power and authority. Women will usually (but not universally) take the title 'Lady' instead of Laird or Lord, but there is an example of a female Lord: \"Lord of Mann\", the ruler of the Isle of Man. The territory belonging to a lord is often called a lordship. Lords as a group are a peerage.\nThe word actually comes from the Old English forms for \"loaf\" (bread) and \"ward\" (used to mean \"protector\", although today it means \"one who is protected\"). So a \"lord\" or \"loaf ward\" was originally \"the one who protected the loaf\". A mesne lord was a lord in the feudal system who had vassals who held land from him, but who was himself the vassal of a higher lord. The one who ruled over mesne lords was sometimes called an overlord. This higher lord was sometimes the king.\nIn a religious context, The Lord means God, mainly by the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"power","offset":74},{"uri":"Authority","surface_form":"authority","offset":84},{"uri":"Ruler","surface_form":"ruler","offset":246},{"uri":"Isle_of_Man","surface_form":"Isle of Man","offset":259},{"uri":"Peerage","surface_form":"peerage","offset":357},{"uri":"Old_English_language","surface_form":"Old English","offset":399},{"uri":"Loaf","surface_form":"loaf","offset":422},{"uri":"Ward","surface_form":"ward","offset":441},{"uri":"Feudal","surface_form":"feudal","offset":630},{"uri":"Vassal","surface_form":"vassal","offset":652},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":882},{"uri":"Abrahamic_religions","surface_form":"Abrahamic religions","offset":901},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":922},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":931},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":942}]}
