{"id":46430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)","text":"e=\"preserve\">An interval in music means the distance between two notes (whether these notes are played together or separately).\nTwo notes on a keyboard which are next to one another (counting both white and black notes) are a \u201Csemitone\u201D apart. A \u201Ctone\u201D is two semitones (see semitone). However, an \u201Cintervale\u201D depends on how the notes are written (what they are called) e.g. whether the black note between D and E is written as D sharp or E flat (which are two different names for the same note).\nPlease note that in all of the examples below, C is the lower note of the pair, and the other note is the next note of that name above it. So, the interval between a C and a B is only a major 7th if it is between a C and next B above it.\nMajor and perfect intervals in the major scale.\nC D E F G A B C and down again.\nDiminished intervals.\nIf a perfect interval becomes smaller by a semitone it becomes \u201Cdiminished\u201D\nIf a major interval becomes smaller by \"two\" semitones (i.e. a tone) it becomes \u201Cdiminished\u201D\nAugmented intervals.\nIf a major interval is made bigger by a semitone it becomes \u201Caugmented\u201D\nSimilarly, if a perfect interval becomes bigger by a semitone it becomes \u201Caugmented\u201D\nIt is important to realize that, in order to work out what an interval is, the lower note should be treated as the first note of the scale.\nInverted intervals.\nIntervals can be \u201Cinverted\u201D (turned upside down). For example: instead of going from a C up to an A (major 6th) we can go from C down to an A (minor 3rd).\nCompound intervals are intervals bigger than an octave e.g.\nC to D an octave and one more note above it is a major 9th.\nBig intervals are called \u201Cwide\u201D intervals. The opposite is a \u201Cnarrow\u201D interval.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":28},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":44},{"uri":"Note_(music)","surface_form":"notes","offset":65},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":143},{"uri":"Semitone","surface_form":"semitone","offset":275}]}
