{"id":46431,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode","text":"e=\"preserve\">Modes in music are a kind of scale.\nThe Ancient Greeks used several modes in their music. Medieval musicians borrowed the names of these modes to describe the scales used in their music. Western music predominantly usually uses two scales: major and minor, which correspond to the Ionian and Aeolian modes. Like any other scale, a mode can start on any note.\nEach mode has a different pattern of tones and semitones (or \u201Chalf tones\u201D) (see semitone).\ntone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone.\ntone, semitone, tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone.\nEach mode also has a version called \u201Chypo\u2014\u201C.\nFor example: A to A is Hypodorian. It is the same as Aeolian, but the D is treated as the \u201Ckeynote\u201D.\nThe names of the modes come from cities in Ancient Greece.\nIn the Middle Ages these modes were widely used in church music.\nSome composers in recent centuries have enjoyed using the ancient modes from time to time in their music. Folksongs are often modal. Greensleeves is an example of a well-known tune which is modal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scale_(music)","surface_form":"scale","offset":42},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greeks","offset":53},{"uri":"Semitone","surface_form":"semitone","offset":452},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":742},{"uri":"Church_music","surface_form":"church music","offset":819},{"uri":"Folksong","surface_form":"Folksong","offset":939},{"uri":"Greensleeves","surface_form":"Greensleeves","offset":966}]}
