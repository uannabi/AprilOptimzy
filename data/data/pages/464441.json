{"id":464441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichal_Peri","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pichal Peri or Churail or Churel (Urdu:meaning, with reversed\nfeet) is a sort of legendary witch or monster type creature in Central Asian and\nSouth Asian folklore.\nIn the Indian-Pakistani folklores, it has two forms, one is of a witch who is very dark, ugly and scary, and another is of a beautiful woman who targets vulnerable men passing through the woods after the dark; they appear and vanish after a while, leaving a fearful experience to the victims. Whereas, some other claims also assert they attack and kill human beings, to eat their livers. Some people say they have seen this creature in reality and have somehow escaped. According to them, it has long hair and long teeth and feet that are reversed (with heel in front and toes turned back).\nHowever, there is no real proof this creature really exists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":47},{"uri":"Witch","surface_form":"witch","offset":104},{"uri":"Monster","surface_form":"monster","offset":113},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":138},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":156}]}
