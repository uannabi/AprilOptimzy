{"id":4646,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat","text":"Meat is animal tissue used as food. Most often is used to describe skeletal muscle and fat that is found with it. Types of meat include beef and veal from cattle, pork, ham and bacon from pigs, mutton from sheep, \"venison\" from deer, fish, insects, and poultry from chickens, ducks and turkeys. The word meat is also used for sausages and for non-muscle organs which are used for food, for example liver, brain, and kidneys.\nIn the meat processing industry, (in some countries) the word \"meat\" is to mean only the flesh of mammalian species such as pigs, cattle, etc. but does not include fish, insects and poultry.\nMeat is an important part of the diet of many people because it contains protein. Protein helps the growth and healing of a body and gives energy. Meat is a \"high-protein\" food, but costs more than other foods like bread and vegetables. People who cannot afford meat, or who do not like to eat it need to find other ways to get enough protein in their diet. Beans and certain nuts are also high in protein. People that choose not to eat meat are called vegetarians, and those who do not eat any animal product are known as vegans.\nAnimals such as members of the cat family that mainly eat animals are called carnivores.\nRed meat is darker-coloured meat, different from white meat such as chicken or fish. Some raw meat can make people sick or even cause death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":8},{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissue","offset":15},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":30},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeletal","offset":67},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":76},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":87},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":136},{"uri":"Veal","surface_form":"veal","offset":145},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":155},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":163},{"uri":"Ham","surface_form":"ham","offset":169},{"uri":"Bacon","surface_form":"bacon","offset":177},{"uri":"Pig","surface_form":"pig","offset":188},{"uri":"Mutton","surface_form":"mutton","offset":194},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":206},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":228},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":234},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":240},{"uri":"Poultry","surface_form":"poultry","offset":253},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":266},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":276},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"turkey","offset":286},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"sausage","offset":326},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":354},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":398},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":405},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidney","offset":416},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":448},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":523},{"uri":"Pig","surface_form":"pig","offset":549},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cattle","offset":555},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":589},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":595},{"uri":"Poultry","surface_form":"poultry","offset":607},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":689},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":831},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":841},{"uri":"Bean","surface_form":"Bean","offset":974},{"uri":"Nuts","surface_form":"nuts","offset":992},{"uri":"Vegetarian","surface_form":"vegetarian","offset":1069},{"uri":"Vegan","surface_form":"vegan","offset":1139},{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"cat family","offset":1178},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":1224},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"Red","offset":1236},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":1285},{"uri":"Raw","surface_form":"raw","offset":1326},{"uri":"Illness","surface_form":"sick","offset":1351},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":1370}]}
