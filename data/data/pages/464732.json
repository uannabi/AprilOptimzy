{"id":464732,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(2009)","text":"Sacrifice (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was held on May 24, 2009 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the fifth Sacrifice event that TNA held.\nThere were eight matches on the card. The main event was known as the Four Way Ultimate Sacrifice match, which was between TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Mick Foley, against Sting, Kurt Angle, and Jeff Jarrett. Each of the competitors in the match wagered an important aspect of their career: Foley's title, Sting's career, Angle's leadership of the Main Event Mafia, and Jarrett's shares in the company. Two other important matches saw A.J. Styles retaining the TNA Legends Championship against Booker T in an \"I Quit\" match and Beer Money, Inc. defeating The British Invasion to win the \"Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament\".\nSacrifice gained positive reviews. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter thought that the show, \"overachieved\". Melzer gave attention to the \"Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament\" finals match and the \"I Quit\" match. The only thing he criticized was some of the illogical booking tactics that were made by the company. James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch also gave the event a good review but criticized the show in a number of spots, mainly the \"I Quit\" match: \"Best match of the PPV until the finish with Sharmell-Jenna continuing their feud on PPV TV. Keep it on free TV (if TNA is so adamant about continuing this), but don't put that dumb storyline on pay TV. As usual, TNA tries to find a way out of a stipulation. Sucks to rant on that, because the match was awesome and one of Booker's best performances in years.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":23},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":46},{"uri":"Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling","surface_form":"Total Nonstop Action Wrestling","offset":72},{"uri":"Impact_Zone","surface_form":"TNA Impact!
