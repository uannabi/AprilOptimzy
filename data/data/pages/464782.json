{"id":464782,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_element","text":"e=\"preserve\">A literary element is a part of books and stories of narrative fiction. It is kind of verbal storytelling. It can be found in any written or spoken narrative. This is different than literary techniques. For example, plot, theme, and tone are literary elements. Figurative language, irony, or foreshadowing are literary techniques.\nLiterary elements help in the discussion and understanding of a work of literature as basic categories of critical analysis; literary elements could be said to be made by the readers of a work just as much as they are produced by its author. They are a kind of literary education at the primary and secondary level. A set of terms often appear in a school's student evaluations. For example, the New York State Comprehensive English Regents Examinations make students use and talk about literary elements relating to works in each of the two essays.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Narrative","surface_form":"narrative","offset":66},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":76},{"uri":"Literary_technique","surface_form":"literary technique","offset":195},{"uri":"Plot_(narrative)","surface_form":"plot","offset":229},{"uri":"Theme_(narrative)","surface_form":"theme","offset":235},{"uri":"Figurative_language","surface_form":"Figurative language","offset":274},{"uri":"Irony","surface_form":"irony","offset":295},{"uri":"Foreshadowing","surface_form":"foreshadowing","offset":305},{"uri":"Discussion","surface_form":"discussion","offset":374},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":416},{"uri":"Critical_analysis","surface_form":"critical analysis","offset":450},{"uri":"Secondary_education","surface_form":"secondary","offset":643},{"uri":"Essay","surface_form":"essay","offset":886}]}
