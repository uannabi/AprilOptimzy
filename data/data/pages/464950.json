It is also called an attack, an advance or an invasion. An offensive can be conducted on land, at sea or in the air. A common goal of an offensive is to engage the enemy in a battle. It can also be used to get an enemy to withdraw and avoid a battle.\nA tactical offensive is an operation that is usually smaller or more limited. It often involves the use of Special forces (or specialized forces). It often has a limited task such as the capture of a bridge or stronghold. A strategic offensive usually involves larger forces and usually has long-range goals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aggressive","surface_form":"aggressive","offset":32},{"uri":"Military_operation","surface_form":"military operation","offset":43},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemy","offset":82},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"force","offset":88},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":116},{"uri":"Advance","surface_form":"advance","offset":127},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":141},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":184},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"sea","offset":193},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":207},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":270},{"uri":"Special_forces","surface_form":"Special forces","offset":453},{"uri":"Task","surface_form":"task","offset":516},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":546},{"uri":"Stronghold","surface_form":"stronghold","offset":556}]}
