{"id":465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime","text":"Lime is a green fruit, and the tree fruit itself. They are citrus fruits similar to lemons. Limes are rich in vitamin C. Sailors from Britain were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with scurvy. This is how they got the nickname \"Limey\". There are several citrus trees whose fruits are called limes. They include the key lime \"Citrus aurantiifolia\", the Persian lime, the kaffir lime, and the desert lime \"Citrus glauca\".\nLimes are small, round and bright green. If they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow. Then they look like small round lemons.\nLime juice is used in cooking and in drinks. Lime oils are often used in perfumes, used for cleaning, and used for aromatherapy.\nLime tastes acidic and bitter. Lime juice is also made from limes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":36},{"uri":"Citrus","surface_form":"citrus","offset":59},{"uri":"Lemon","surface_form":"lemon","offset":84},{"uri":"Vitamin_C","surface_form":"vitamin C","offset":110},{"uri":"Sailor","surface_form":"Sailor","offset":121},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":134},{"uri":"Scurvy","surface_form":"scurvy","offset":203},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":236},{"uri":"Key_lime","surface_form":"key lime","offset":333},{"uri":"Persian_lime","surface_form":"Persian lime","offset":370},{"uri":"Kaffir_lime","surface_form":"kaffir lime","offset":388},{"uri":"Desert_lime","surface_form":"desert lime","offset":409},{"uri":"Lemon","surface_form":"lemon","offset":570},{"uri":"Aromatherapy","surface_form":"aromatherapy","offset":693},{"uri":"Bitter","surface_form":"bitter","offset":730}]}
