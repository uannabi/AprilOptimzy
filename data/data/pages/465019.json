{"id":465019,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Henning","text":"Alan Henning (15 August 1967 \u2013 c. 3 October 2014) was a British taxicab driver-turned-humanitarian aid worker. He was the fourth Western hostage killed by Islamic State (IS). Henning was captured during IS's occupation of the Syrian city of Al-Dana in December 2013, where he was helping with humanitarian relief.\nThe British Foreign Office withheld news of Henning's capture while they attempted to negotiate his release. Henning was shown at the end of David Cawthorne Haines's execution video, released on 13 September 2014, and referred to by \"Jihadi John\" as the next victim. A video of Henning's beheading was released by IS on 3 October 2014.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":56},{"uri":"Taxicab","surface_form":"taxicab","offset":64},{"uri":"Humanitarian_aid","surface_form":"humanitarian aid","offset":86},{"uri":"Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","surface_form":"Islamic State","offset":155},{"uri":"Al-Dana%2C_Syria","surface_form":"Al-Dana","offset":241},{"uri":"Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office","surface_form":"British Foreign Office","offset":318},{"uri":"David_Cawthorne_Haines","surface_form":"David Cawthorne Haines","offset":455},{"uri":"Jihadi_John","surface_form":"Jihadi John","offset":548}]}
