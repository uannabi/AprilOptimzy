{"id":465148,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine","text":"Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is an \u03B1-amino acid. It has the chemical formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH2SH.\nCysteine is a semi-essential amino acid, which means that humans can make it. The codons UGU and UGC code for cysteine. The thiol side chain in cysteine often does enzyme reactions as a nucleophile. The thiol oxidises to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which is important in many protein structures. When used as a food additive, cysteine has the E\u00A0number E920.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":43},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":66},{"uri":"Codon","surface_form":"codon","offset":183},{"uri":"Thiol","surface_form":"thiol","offset":225},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":265},{"uri":"Nucleophile","surface_form":"nucleophile","offset":287},{"uri":"Disulfide_bond","surface_form":"disulfide","offset":331},{"uri":"Cystine","surface_form":"cystine","offset":352},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":388},{"uri":"E%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bnumber","surface_form":"E\u00A0number","offset":455}]}
