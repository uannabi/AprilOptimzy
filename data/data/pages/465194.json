{"id":465194,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Houses_of_Cuenca","text":"The \"Casas Colgadas\" (Hanging Houses), also known as \"Casas Voladas\", \"Casas del Rey\" is a complex of houses located in Cuenca, Spain. Houses of this kind were frequent along the eastern border of the ancient city in the past. They hang on the cliffs over the Hu\u00E9car River gorge. Today there are only a few of the houses still there. The most well known is a group of three with wooden balconies. The houses date to the 14th century. Through the years they have been refurbished a few times. The most recent took place during the 1920s. They have been used as individual homes. They have also been used as council houses. Now they are the host to a \"mes\u00F3n\", a type of restaurant, and the Museo de Arte Abstracto Espa\u00F1ol (Spanish Abstract Art Museum), in Cuenca.\nThe Casas Colgadas were one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cuenca%2C_Spain","surface_form":"Cuenca, Spain","offset":120},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":244},{"uri":"Hu%C3%A9car_River","surface_form":"Hu\u00E9car River","offset":260},{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":273},{"uri":"14th_century","surface_form":"14th century","offset":420},{"uri":"Refurbish","surface_form":"refurbish","offset":467},{"uri":"Museo_de_Arte_Abstracto_Espa%C3%B1ol","surface_form":"Museo de Arte Abstracto Espa\u00F1ol","offset":688},{"uri":"12_Treasures_of_Spain","surface_form":"12 Treasures of Spain","offset":815}]}
