He was born in Pitane, a town of Aeolis, in Asia Minor. His works were probably completed in Athens between the years 335 BC and 300 BC. Autolycus' surviving works include a book on spheres (called \"On the Moving Sphere\") and another on the rising and setting of celestial bodies. \"On the Moving Sphere\" is believed to be the oldest mathematical treatise from ancient Greece that is completely preserved.\nEuclid mentions Autolycus' work. Autolycus also taught Arcesilaus.\nMaurolycus translated Autolycus' works in the sixteenth century.\nMathematics.\nAutolycus studied the movements of a sphere. It is believed they were the earliest written mathematics related books which have actually survived. Theodosius' \"Sphaerics\" was based on Autolycus' work on spheres.\nAstronomy.\nAutolycus studied the relationship between the rising and the setting of the celestial bodies, and wrote that \"any star which rises and sets always rises and sets at the same point in the horizon.\"\nA crater on the Moon is named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"360_BC","surface_form":"360 BC","offset":25},{"uri":"290_BC","surface_form":"290 BC","offset":39},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":53},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":59},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":71},{"uri":"Geographer","surface_form":"geographer","offset":90},{"uri":"Pitane_(Aeolis)","surface_form":"Pitane","offset":117},{"uri":"Aeolis","surface_form":"Aeolis","offset":135},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":146},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":195},{"uri":"335_BC","surface_form":"335 BC","offset":220},{"uri":"300_BC","surface_form":"300 BC","offset":231},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":284},{"uri":"Celestial_body","surface_form":"celestial bodies","offset":365},{"uri":"Euclid","surface_form":"Euclid","offset":507},{"uri":"Arcesilaus","surface_form":"Arcesilaus","offset":562},{"uri":"Maurolycus","surface_form":"Maurolycus","offset":574},{"uri":"Theodosius_of_Bithynia","surface_form":"Theodosius","offset":799},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":1075}]}
