{"id":465256,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming","text":"=\"preserve\">Logic programming is using mathematical logic to write computer programs. There are specialized programming languages where the user can directly enter logical statements. Probably the best-known of these languages is called Prolog. Alonzo Church used a form of logic programming in what is known as lambda calculus today. Logic programming has also been used in LISP.\nPrograms consist of a set of rules and facts. In most cases, logic programming uses what is called negation as failure or \"weak negation:\" This means that if it is not possible to derive some clause formula_1 from the facts and rules, the system will assume that its negation is true.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematical_logic","surface_form":"mathematical logic","offset":39},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":67},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":108},{"uri":"Prolog","surface_form":"Prolog","offset":237},{"uri":"Alonzo_Church","surface_form":"Alonzo Church","offset":245},{"uri":"Lambda_calculus","surface_form":"lambda calculus","offset":312},{"uri":"LISP","surface_form":"LISP","offset":375},{"uri":"Negation_as_failure","surface_form":"negation as failure","offset":480}]}
