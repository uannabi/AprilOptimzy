{"id":465268,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantifier","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics and logic, the universal quantifier is a quantifier used to state that a proposition applies to all elements in the universe of discourse. An example that uses this quantifier would be the proposition \"All men are mortal\". Usually, a turned A (\u2200) is used to denote the universal quantifier, \"for all x\" is written as either \"\u2200x\", \"\u2200(x)\".\nPredicate logic and syllogisms look at the properties of universal quantification.\nPropositions can be falsified. To falsify a proposition which contains a universal quantifier, it is sufficient to find one element of the universe of discourse where the proposition is false. This element is known as a counterexample.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":32},{"uri":"Logical_quantifier","surface_form":"quantifier","offset":69},{"uri":"Proposition","surface_form":"proposition","offset":101},{"uri":"Universe_of_discourse","surface_form":"universe of discourse","offset":144},{"uri":"Predicate_logic","surface_form":"Predicate logic","offset":366},{"uri":"Syllogism","surface_form":"syllogism","offset":386},{"uri":"Counterexample","surface_form":"counterexample","offset":669}]}
