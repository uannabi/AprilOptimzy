{"id":465270,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_quantifier","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics and logic, the existence quantifier is a quantifier used to state that a proposition is true for at least one element in the universe of discourse. The existence quantifier is commonly written as formula_1 (a mirrored E), and is read as \"there exists\". An example involving an existence quantifier is the statement \"some natural number is equal to 3+5\", which can be written as formula_1.\nIn general, a statement of the form formula_1 is true if there is an \"x\" in the universe of discourse satisfying the predicate formula_1, and is false otherwise. An existence quantifier is different from a universal quantifier, which is used to state that a proposition is true for \"all\" elements in the universe of discourse.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":32},{"uri":"Logical_quantifier","surface_form":"quantifier","offset":69},{"uri":"Universe_of_discourse","surface_form":"universe of discourse","offset":153},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":349},{"uri":"Universal_quantifier","surface_form":"universal quantifier","offset":623}]}
