It is across from the Town Hall and the Episcopal Palace (Archbishop's palace). The Santa Mar\u00EDa Square is one of the historical sites in Ja\u00E9n. The cathedral stands on the same ground that was once occupied by an early mosque.\nConstruction of the cathedral began in 1249. It was built on the ruins of an early Spanish mosque. It was damaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions during the following two centuries. In the sixteenth century Andr\u00E9s de Vandelvira built the biggest part of the Cathedral. It was consecrated in 1724.\nThe more representative architectural element is its fa\u00E7ade. It was designed by Eufrasio L\u00F3pez de Rojas. It was sculpted by Pedro Rold\u00E1n. It houses the Veil of Veronica. In 1545 the young Francisco Guerrero was the \"maestro de capilla\".\nJa\u00E9n Cathedral is one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":44},{"uri":"Renaissance_architecture","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":52},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":64},{"uri":"Ja%C3%A9n%2C_Spain","surface_form":"Ja\u00E9n","offset":107},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":113},{"uri":"Town_Hall","surface_form":"Town Hall","offset":142},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"Palace","offset":170},{"uri":"Archbishop","surface_form":"Archbishop","offset":178},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":248},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":338},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"Construction","offset":346},{"uri":"Ruins","surface_form":"ruins","offset":411},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":437},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9s_de_Vandelvira","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9s de Vandelvira","offset":555},{"uri":"Consecrated","surface_form":"consecrated","offset":624},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architectural","offset":669},{"uri":"Fa%C3%A7ade","surface_form":"fa\u00E7ade","offset":698},{"uri":"Pedro_Rold%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Pedro Rold\u00E1n","offset":769},{"uri":"Veil_of_Veronica","surface_form":"Veil of Veronica","offset":797},{"uri":"Francisco_Guerrero_(composer)","surface_form":"Francisco Guerrero","offset":833},{"uri":"12_Treasures_of_Spain","surface_form":"12 Treasures of Spain","offset":929}]}
