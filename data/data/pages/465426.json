{"id":465426,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_owl","text":"\"Bubo\" is a genus of large owls. It includes the eagle-owls (Old World) and the horned owls (the Americas). This genus contains about one or two dozen species of typical owls (family Strigidae) and is found in many parts of the world. Some of the largest living Strigiformes are in \"Bubo\". Traditionally, only owls with ear-tufts were included here, but that is no longer the case.\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome \"b\" sequence data supports the decision to put the snowy owl, an eagle-owl adapted to Arctic conditions, into \"Bubo\".\nThe fish-owls in the genus \"Ketupa\", and the \"Scotopelia\" fishing owls, are also closely related. They might be moved into \"Bubus\", but that would make the genus rather large. As it is some of these owls, like Verreaux's eagle-owl, are not studied enough. More research is needed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":12},{"uri":"Owls","surface_form":"owls","offset":27},{"uri":"Old_World","surface_form":"Old World","offset":61},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":97},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":151},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":176},{"uri":"Strigidae","surface_form":"Strigidae","offset":183},{"uri":"Strigiformes","surface_form":"Strigiformes","offset":262},{"uri":"Mitochondrial_DNA","surface_form":"Mitochondrial DNA","offset":382},{"uri":"Cytochrome_b","surface_form":"cytochrome \"b\"","offset":408},{"uri":"DNA_sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":423},{"uri":"Snowy_owl","surface_form":"snowy owl","offset":470},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adapted","offset":494},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":505},{"uri":"Verreaux%27s_eagle-owl","surface_form":"Verreaux's eagle-owl","offset":747}]}
