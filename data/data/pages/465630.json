{"id":465630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia","text":"\"Sarracenia\" (or) is a genus of 8 to 11 species of carnivorous plants. They are often called trumpet pitchers. The genus is in the family Sarraceniaceae. That family also contains \"Darlingtonia\" and \"Heliamphora\".\nIn the wild, \"Sarracenia\" grows around the East Coast of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeast Canada. Most species grow only in the southeast United States. Only \"S.\u00A0purpurea\" can live in cold places. The plant's leaves have evolved into a funnel in order to trap insects. The plant digests its food with proteases and other enzymes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":23},{"uri":"Carnivorous_plants","surface_form":"carnivorous plants","offset":51},{"uri":"Sarraceniaceae","surface_form":"Sarraceniaceae","offset":138},{"uri":"Darlingtonia_(Sarraceniaceae)","surface_form":"Darlingtonia","offset":181},{"uri":"Heliamphora","surface_form":"Heliamphora","offset":200},{"uri":"East_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"East Coast of the United States","offset":257},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":290},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":301},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":332},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":380},{"uri":"Sarracenia_purpurea","surface_form":"S.\u00A0purpurea","offset":401},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolved","offset":463},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":502},{"uri":"Protease","surface_form":"protease","offset":543},{"uri":"Enzymes","surface_form":"enzymes","offset":563}]}
