Development proceeds by cell division until maturity; further growth occurs by cell enlargement only.\nMost eutelic organisms are small or even microscopic: examples include the nematodes like ascaris, gastrotrichs, rotifers, tardigrades and dicyemida.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Somatic_cell","surface_form":"somatic cell","offset":41},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":122},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":155},{"uri":"Nematodes","surface_form":"nematodes","offset":308},{"uri":"Ascaris","surface_form":"ascaris","offset":323},{"uri":"Gastrotrich","surface_form":"gastrotrich","offset":332},{"uri":"Rotifer","surface_form":"rotifer","offset":346},{"uri":"Tardigrades","surface_form":"tardigrades","offset":356},{"uri":"Dicyemida","surface_form":"dicyemida","offset":372}]}
