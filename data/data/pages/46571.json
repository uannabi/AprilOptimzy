{"id":46571,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1","text":"Voyager 1 is a spacecraft used by NASA to explore Jupiter and Saturn. It is identical in form to its sister ship, \"Voyager 2\".\n\"Voyager 1\" was launched on September 5, 1977, to study the outer planets of the Solar System. It is now in an extended mission. Its encounter with Saturn and Titan sent it on a hyperbolic trajectory out of the solar system, traveling at which is much faster than escape velocity.\n\"Voyager 1\" research team announced on August 25, 2012 that it had left the solar system. It passed out of the heliosphere and into interstellar space. It is the most distant man-made object. It is also the first man-made object to leave the solar system. As of January 1, 2020 it was from Earth.\nBoth \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" include the Voyager Golden Record, which is a recording of sounds and images of life on Earth. It was designed by a team headed by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":15},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":34},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":50},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":62},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":115},{"uri":"Outer_planets","surface_form":"outer planets","offset":187},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":208},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_trajectory","surface_form":"hyperbolic trajectory","offset":305},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":338},{"uri":"Escape_velocity","surface_form":"escape velocity","offset":391},{"uri":"Heliosphere","surface_form":"heliosphere","offset":519},{"uri":"Interstellar_medium","surface_form":"interstellar space","offset":540},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":650},{"uri":"Voyager_Golden_Record","surface_form":"Voyager Golden Record","offset":750},{"uri":"Carl_Sagan","surface_form":"Carl Sagan","offset":869},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"extraterrestrial life","offset":900}]}
