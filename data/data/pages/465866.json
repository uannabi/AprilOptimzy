{"id":465866,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Fox","text":"21st Century Fox (Twenty-First Century Fox) was an American multinational mass media corporation.\nIt is one of two companies made from the 2013 split of News Corporation (founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979). 21st Century Fox has the broadcasting and movie assets and serves as the legal successor to News Corporation. The publishing assets were spun off to form News Corp at the same time. The split was so both companies operate under more \"focused\" management, which Murdoch claimed would \"unlock\" their true value.\nAmong the holdings of 21st Century Fox are Fox Entertainment Group. This owns the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network. There are other assets, such as the pan-Asian pay channel operator Star India.\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company said that they would acquire a lot of 21st Century Fox's subsidiaries for $52 billion USD. This includes the 20th Century Fox studio and Fox's partnership with National Geographic. Some subsidiaries like Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox News Channel will still be a part of 21st Century Fox. The deal closed on March 20, 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Multinational_corporation","surface_form":"multinational","offset":60},{"uri":"Mass_media","surface_form":"mass media","offset":74},{"uri":"News_Corporation","surface_form":"News Corporation","offset":153},{"uri":"Rupert_Murdoch","surface_form":"Rupert Murdoch","offset":182},{"uri":"Broadcasting","surface_form":"broadcasting","offset":232},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":249},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishing","offset":321},{"uri":"Spin-off","surface_form":"spun off","offset":344},{"uri":"News_Corp","surface_form":"News Corp","offset":361},{"uri":"Fox_Entertainment_Group","surface_form":"Fox Entertainment Group","offset":560},{"uri":"20th_Century_Fox","surface_form":"20th Century Fox","offset":599},{"uri":"Film_studio","surface_form":"film studio","offset":616},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox","offset":632},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"television network","offset":636},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":696},{"uri":"Star_India","surface_form":"Star India","offset":723},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"The Walt Disney Company","offset":757},{"uri":"Takeover","surface_form":"acquire","offset":802},{"uri":"Subsidiary","surface_form":"subsidiaries","offset":838},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"USD","offset":867},{"uri":"20th_Century_Fox","surface_form":"20th Century Fox","offset":890},{"uri":"National_Geographic_Society","surface_form":"National Geographic","offset":941},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox Broadcasting Company","offset":985},{"uri":"Fox_News_Channel","surface_form":"Fox News Channel","offset":1014}]}
