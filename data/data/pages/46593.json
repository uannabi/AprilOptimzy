{"id":46593,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_People%27s_Party","text":"The Austrian People's Party (German: \"\u00D6sterreichische Volkspartei\", shortenend to \u00D6VP) is one of the biggest parties in Austria. It was founded in 1945. Its name roughly translates to Austrian People's party. It has about 630,000 members. Its views are often center-right. This means it often has conservative views on the matters at hand. Many of its voters are Catholics. It is against moderate socialism, which is embodied by the other big party, the SP\u00D6.\nFormer Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00FCssel is a member of this party. Former Minister of the Interior Liese Prokop (died 2006) was also a member.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":29},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"parties","offset":109},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":120},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservative","offset":297},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":363},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialism","offset":397},{"uri":"SP%C3%96","surface_form":"SP\u00D6","offset":454},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Sch%C3%BCssel","surface_form":"Wolfgang Sch\u00FCssel","offset":477},{"uri":"Minister_of_the_Interior","surface_form":"Minister of the Interior","offset":529},{"uri":"Liese_Prokop","surface_form":"Liese Prokop","offset":554}]}
