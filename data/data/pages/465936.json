It is around the Klondike River, a small river that enters Yukon from the east at Dawson City. The Klondike Gold Rush took place there from 1897 to 1899.\nThe summers in the Klondike are short and very hot. The winters are long and very cold. There are snow storms between September and May.\nJack London's novel \"The Call of the Wild\", published in 1903, was set in the Klondike.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yukon","surface_form":"Yukon","offset":40},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":59},{"uri":"Klondike_River","surface_form":"Klondike River","offset":84},{"uri":"Dawson_City%2C_Yukon","surface_form":"Dawson City","offset":149},{"uri":"Klondike_Gold_Rush","surface_form":"Klondike Gold Rush","offset":166},{"uri":"Jack_London","surface_form":"Jack London","offset":358},{"uri":"The_Call_of_the_Wild","surface_form":"The Call of the Wild","offset":379}]}
