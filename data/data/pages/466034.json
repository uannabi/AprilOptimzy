{"id":466034,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chehel_Sotoun","text":"Chehel Sotoun (or 'Chihil Sutun') is a pavilion in Isfahan, Iran. It is in the middle of a park at the end of a long pool. It was built by Shah Abbas II for his entertainment and receptions. In this palace, Shah Abbas II and his successors would receive dignitaries and ambassadors, either on the terrace or in one of the stately reception halls.\nThe name, meaning \"Forty Columns\" in Persian, was inspired by the twenty slender wooden columns supporting the entrance pavilion, which, when reflected in the waters of the fountain, are said to appear to be forty.\nThe palace has many frescoes and paintings on ceramic. Many of the ceramic panels are now in the possession of major museums in the west. They show specific historical scenes. There are also aesthetic compositions in the traditional miniature style which celebrate the joy of life and love.\nThe Chehel Sotoun Palace is among the nine Iranian Gardens which are registered as one of the Iran\u2019s 17 World Heritage Sites. The nine gardens go by the name of \"The Persian Garden\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Isfahan_(city)","surface_form":"Isfahan","offset":51},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":60},{"uri":"Shah_Abbas_II","surface_form":"Shah Abbas II","offset":139},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":199},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"ambassador","offset":270},{"uri":"Reflecting_pool","surface_form":"reflected in the waters of the fountain","offset":489},{"uri":"Fresco","surface_form":"fresco","offset":582},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":608}]}
