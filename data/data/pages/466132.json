{"id":466132,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotra","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gotra is a clan in Hindu society. It means the people who are descended in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor. In the 4th century, P\u0101\u1E47ini wrote that gotra are the descendants of a sage, \"beginning with the son's son.\"(IV. 1. 162). A person who says \"I am Kashyapa-gotra,\" can trace his family from the ancient sage Kashyapa through an unbroken male line.\nAccording to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad 2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadv\u0101ja, Vi\u015Bv\u0101mitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Ka\u015Bhyapa, and Atri are seven sages (also known as Saptarishi). The descendants of these eight sages are said to be gotras. This explanation of the eight primary gotras seems to have been known to P\u0101\u1E47ini. Descendants of others are called \"gotr\u00E2vayava\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clan","surface_form":"clan","offset":24},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":32},{"uri":"Descendant","surface_form":"descended","offset":75},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":129},{"uri":"P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini","surface_form":"P\u0101\u1E47ini","offset":159},{"uri":"Sage","surface_form":"sage","offset":208}]}
