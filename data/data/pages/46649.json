{"id":46649,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role","text":"A role (sometimes spelled r\u00F4le) or a social role can be described as an expected behaviour of an individual.\nMore precisely one could say it is a set of connected behaviours, rights and duties that a person has to follow in a social situation. It depends on social status.\n\"Role confusion\" is a situation where an individual has trouble to decide which role he/she should play. For example, one could be a student who would attend a meeting of a particular recreational interest and find her teacher there. They would be in conflict between behaving as a student and as an enthusiast who shares the same interest as the teacher.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behaviour","offset":81},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behaviour","offset":163},{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":175},{"uri":"Social_status","surface_form":"social status","offset":258},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":406},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":492}]}
