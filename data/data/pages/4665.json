{"id":4665,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum","text":"Platinum is a soft, heavy, white metal. It is a precious metal. It usually costs more than gold.\nIn chemistry, platinum is element number 78, and its atoms have an atomic weight of 195 a.m.u.. The symbol for platinum is Pt, from Spanish \"platina\" meaning \"little silver\".\nPlatinum is very malleable and ductile, which means it can be hammered into thin sheets and it can be pulled into wire. Platinum is very stable. Acids do not affect platinum.\nThe most common use of Platinum is in a vehicle's catalytic converter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soft","surface_form":"soft","offset":14},{"uri":"Heavy","surface_form":"heavy","offset":20},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":33},{"uri":"Precious_metal","surface_form":"precious metal","offset":48},{"uri":"Price","surface_form":"costs","offset":75},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":91},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":100},{"uri":"Element_number","surface_form":"element number","offset":123},{"uri":"Atoms","surface_form":"atoms","offset":150},{"uri":"Atomic_weight","surface_form":"atomic weight","offset":164},{"uri":"A.m.u.","surface_form":"a.m.u.","offset":185},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":197},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":229},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":263},{"uri":"Malleable","surface_form":"malleable","offset":289},{"uri":"Ductile","surface_form":"ductile","offset":303},{"uri":"Sheets","surface_form":"sheets","offset":353},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":386},{"uri":"Stable","surface_form":"stable","offset":409},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"Acid","offset":417},{"uri":"Affect","surface_form":"affect","offset":430},{"uri":"Catalytic_converter","surface_form":"catalytic converter","offset":497}]}
