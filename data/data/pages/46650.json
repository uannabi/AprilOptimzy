{"id":46650,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas","text":"Aeneas was a Trojan prince and hero. His father was Anchises, his mother was the Greek goddess Aphrodite (Venus in the case of Roman sources). Both Homer and Vergil mention him in their stories. Vergil wrote a whole series of books about him. These books are called Aeneis in their original Latin. The usual English translation of the title is \"Aeneid\".\nThe books are the story of \"pious Aeneas\". and about how the city of Rome came to be.\nThe tale starts with Aeneas carrying his father out of the burning Troy, and end with Romulus and Remus founding Rome (after Aeneas landed on the coast, after sailing the Mediterranean Sea for a long time). Aeneas also appears in Book 5 of the \"Iliad\" written by Homer.\nWilliam Shakespeare also wrote a story mentioning Aeneas. Christopher Marlowe wrote a play about Aeneas and Dido, the queen who fell in love with him. There is also an opera about Dido and Aeneas, written by Henry Purcell.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Troy","surface_form":"Trojan","offset":13},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"prince","offset":20},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":31},{"uri":"Anchises","surface_form":"Anchises","offset":52},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":81},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"goddess","offset":87},{"uri":"Aphrodite","surface_form":"Aphrodite","offset":95},{"uri":"Venus_(mythology)","surface_form":"Venus","offset":106},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":127},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":148},{"uri":"Publius_Vergilius_Maro","surface_form":"Vergil","offset":158},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":226},{"uri":"Aeneis","surface_form":"Aeneis","offset":266},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":291},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":308},{"uri":"Aeneid","surface_form":"Aeneid","offset":345},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":423},{"uri":"Romulus_and_Remus","surface_form":"Romulus and Remus","offset":526},{"uri":"Founder","surface_form":"founding","offset":544},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":611},{"uri":"Iliad","surface_form":"Iliad","offset":685},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":703},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":710},{"uri":"Christopher_Marlowe","surface_form":"Christopher Marlowe","offset":768},{"uri":"Dido%2C_Queen_of_Carthage","surface_form":"Dido","offset":818},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":878},{"uri":"Henry_Purcell","surface_form":"Henry Purcell","offset":918}]}
