It is the longest provincial highway in Canada. The highway is a continuation of U.S. Route 97, from which it gets its name.\nThe highway has several names, depending on which part of British Columbia it passes through. For example, the 269 kilometer (167 mile) part between the U.S. border and the town of Cache Creek is called the \"Okanagan Highway\", named after the Okanagan region of British Columbia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"provincial","offset":33},{"uri":"Highway","surface_form":"highway","offset":44},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":55},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":73},{"uri":"Osoyoos","surface_form":"Osoyoos","offset":174},{"uri":"Yukon","surface_form":"Yukon","offset":206},{"uri":"Watson_Lake%2C_Yukon","surface_form":"Watson Lake, Yukon","offset":224},{"uri":"U.S._Route_97","surface_form":"U.S. Route 97","offset":325},{"uri":"Cache_Creek%2C_British_Columbia","surface_form":"Cache Creek","offset":550},{"uri":"Okanagan","surface_form":"Okanagan","offset":612}]}
