{"id":466726,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_O%27Connor","text":"The Division of O'Connor is an Australian electoral division in the state of Western Australia. It is one of Western Australia's three rural seats. It is named after C. Y. O'Connor, the Engineer-in-Chief of Western Australia who designed Fremantle Harbour and the Goldfields Pipeline. It was set up for the 1980 election.\nThere were large changes to the area covered by O'Connor for the 2010 election. The northern half was added to the new seat of Durack. The boundary for the division moved to the east, including most of the south part of the former Division of Kalgoorlie. It now includes the cities of Albany and Kalgoorlie, and the regional towns of Bridgetown, Denmark, Esperance, Kojonup, Laverton, Leonora, Manjimup, Mount Barker, Ravensthorpe, Southern Cross, Wagin and Warburton.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian electoral division","offset":31},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":68},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":77},{"uri":"C._Y._O%27Connor","surface_form":"C.
