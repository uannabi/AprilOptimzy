{"id":466852,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-dome","text":"A semi-dome(also called a \"half-dome\") is the term in architecture for half a dome. It is used to cover a semi-circular area, usually an apse. A semi-dome was often used at each end of a barrel vaulted ceiling.\nHistory.\nAn early use was to cover Roman cult images. They are a feature found in Ancient Roman and traditional church architecture. The semi-dome is featured in Byzantine architecture and Early Christian architecture. They are prominent in mosques and iwans in Islamic architecture. Some mosques featured semi-domes decorated with glass mosaics. In the second half of the 6th century Ottoman architecture began using half-domes combined with domes. Semi-domes were common in Roman baths, palaces and large buildings. During the Dark Ages in Britain whenever an apse was built, a semi-dome covered it. In 11th century Normandy every apse of every church had a semi-dome over it. The semi-dome went out of use when the east end of churches were squared.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":54},{"uri":"Dome","surface_form":"dome","offset":78},{"uri":"Apse","surface_form":"apse","offset":137},{"uri":"Barrel_vault","surface_form":"barrel vault","offset":187},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":246},{"uri":"Cult","surface_form":"cult","offset":252},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":257},{"uri":"Ancient_Roman_architecture","surface_form":"Ancient Roman","offset":293},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":323},{"uri":"Byzantine_architecture","surface_form":"Byzantine architecture","offset":373},{"uri":"Early_Christian_art_and_architecture","surface_form":"Early Christian architecture","offset":400},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":452},{"uri":"Iwan","surface_form":"iwan","offset":464},{"uri":"Islamic_architecture","surface_form":"Islamic architecture","offset":473},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":543},{"uri":"Mosaic","surface_form":"mosaic","offset":549},{"uri":"Ottoman_architecture","surface_form":"Ottoman architecture","offset":596},{"uri":"Bath","surface_form":"bath","offset":693},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":700},{"uri":"Buildings","surface_form":"buildings","offset":718},{"uri":"Early_Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Dark Ages","offset":740},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"Britain","offset":753},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":816},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":829},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"east","offset":929},{"uri":"Square","surface_form":"square","offset":955}]}
