{"id":46693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein","text":"Felix Christian Klein (April 25, 1849, D\u00FCsseldorf, (then) Prussian Empire \u2013 June 22, 1925, G\u00F6ttingen, Germany) was a German mathematician. He became known for his work in group theory, function theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and on the connections between geometry and group theory. His 1872 Erlangen Program, which ate geometries by their underlying symmetry groups, was a hugely influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the day.\nThe Klein bottle is named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"April_25","surface_form":"April 25","offset":23},{"uri":"1849","surface_form":"1849","offset":33},{"uri":"D%C3%BCsseldorf","surface_form":"D\u00FCsseldorf","offset":39},{"uri":"(then)_Prussian_Empire","surface_form":"(then) Prussian Empire","offset":51},{"uri":"June_22","surface_form":"June 22","offset":76},{"uri":"1925","surface_form":"1925","offset":85},{"uri":"G%C3%B6ttingen","surface_form":"G\u00F6ttingen","offset":91},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":102},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":117},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":124},{"uri":"Group_theory","surface_form":"group theory","offset":171},{"uri":"Function_theory","surface_form":"function theory","offset":185},{"uri":"Non-Euclidean_geometry","surface_form":"non-Euclidean geometry","offset":202},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":257},{"uri":"Group_theory","surface_form":"group theory","offset":270},{"uri":"Erlangen_program","surface_form":"Erlangen Program","offset":293},{"uri":"Group_(mathematics)","surface_form":"groups","offset":361},{"uri":"Klein_bottle","surface_form":"Klein bottle","offset":447}]}
