{"id":467017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras","text":"e=\"preserve\">The contras is the name given to the rebel groups that were active from 1979 through to the early 1990s. They were against the Sandinista Junta of National Reconstruction government in Nicaragua. Among the separate contra groups, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) emerged as the largest by far. In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the Nicaraguan Resistance.\nFrom an early stage, the rebels received financial and military support from the U.S. government. President Ronald Reagan supported the group. After the U.S. support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration secretly gave them money from profit they gained after selling weapons to Iran. These secret activities soon became known as the Iran\u2013Contra affair.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sandinista_National_Liberation_Front","surface_form":"Sandinista","offset":140},{"uri":"Junta_of_National_Reconstruction","surface_form":"Junta of National Reconstruction","offset":151},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":198},{"uri":"Nicaraguan_Democratic_Force","surface_form":"Nicaraguan Democratic Force","offset":247},{"uri":"Nicaraguan_Resistance","surface_form":"Nicaraguan Resistance","offset":398},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S. government","offset":502},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":529},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"Congress","offset":601},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":711},{"uri":"Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair","surface_form":"Iran\u2013Contra affair","offset":766}]}
