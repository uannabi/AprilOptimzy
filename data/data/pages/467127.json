He lived there for two decades with his family. Immanuel founded a successful war supplies factory. The end of the Crimean War in 1856 brought about a shift in Russian policies. Tsar Alexander II ordered a severe cut in the military budget. Immanuel's company lost money. In 1859, Immanuel returned to Sweden. He left his factory to his son Ludvig. In 1862 Immanuel's firm was finally sold by his creditors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swedish_people","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":70},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":78},{"uri":"Inventor","surface_form":"inventor","offset":91},{"uri":"Lathe_(tool)","surface_form":"lathe","offset":135},{"uri":"Plywood","surface_form":"plywood","offset":149},{"uri":"Robert_Nobel","surface_form":"Robert Nobel","offset":193},{"uri":"Ludvig_Nobel","surface_form":"Ludvig Nobel","offset":207},{"uri":"Alfred_Nobel","surface_form":"Alfred Nobel","offset":224},{"uri":"Nitroglycerin","surface_form":"nitroglycerin","offset":270},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":314},{"uri":"St._Petersburg","surface_form":"St. Petersburg","offset":377},{"uri":"Decade","surface_form":"decade","offset":416},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":471},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":484},{"uri":"Crimean_War","surface_form":"Crimean War","offset":508},{"uri":"Tsar_Alexander_II","surface_form":"Tsar Alexander II","offset":571},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":617},{"uri":"Budget","surface_form":"budget","offset":626}]}
