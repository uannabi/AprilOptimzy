Wilson plays Biff in all three movies as well as the Universal Studios ride, and voiced the character in the animated series.\nBiff is the series' antagonist. He is a tall, mean, violent bully who gets what he wants by bullying others into doing his work for him, or by cheating. He and his family members usually misuse idioms in a way that makes them sound foolish and doesn't sound like an insult.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":36},{"uri":"Back_to_the_Future_trilogy","surface_form":"\"Back to the Future\" trilogy","offset":63},{"uri":"Thomas_F._Wilson","surface_form":"Thomas F.
