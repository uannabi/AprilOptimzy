The island had a population, as of 2010, of 68,051, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nThe island is in the northern part of the Bohol Sea (or \"Mindanao Sea\"), to the southwest of the island of Bohol and to the east of the island of Cebu. Panglao is separated from the Bohol island by a narrow strait, the Tagbilaran Strait, and two bridges connect the island with the city of Tagbilaran.\nThere are several smaller islands close to Panglao, such as Gak-ang, Pontod, and Balicasag.\nPanglao has a terrain that range from plain, hilly to mountainous, composed by a limestone that is soluble and that causes the formation of caves and sinkholes. One interesting geological feature of the island is the \"Hinagdanan Cave\" which has an underground water source; because there no rivers or lakes in the island, the cave is an important water source.\nBiodiversity.\nDuring the works of the Panglao Marine Biodiversity Project, about 250 new species of crustaceans and 1,500-2,500 new species of mollusks were found in the waters of Panglao and Balicasag. The project found that Panglao alone has more marine biodiversity than Japan and the Mediterranean sea.\nBecause of this biodiversity, the island was proposed in 2006 as a World Heritage Site by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe island of Panglao is within the Bohol province, and is divided into 2 municipalties and 22 barangays (like neighbourhoods).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":19},{"uri":"Bohol_Sea","surface_form":"Bohol Sea","offset":39},{"uri":"Central_Visayas","surface_form":"Central Visayas","offset":57},{"uri":"Visayas","surface_form":"Visayas","offset":87},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"island group","offset":95},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":130},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"touristic","offset":170},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":201},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":240},{"uri":"Bohol_Sea","surface_form":"Bohol Sea","offset":457},{"uri":"Bohol_(island)","surface_form":"Bohol","offset":522},{"uri":"Cebu_(island)","surface_form":"Cebu","offset":561},{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"strait","offset":622},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":661},{"uri":"Tagbilaran","surface_form":"Tagbilaran","offset":705},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":823},{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":854},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":863},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":890},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":949},{"uri":"Sinkhole","surface_form":"sinkhole","offset":959},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":986},{"uri":"Source","surface_form":"source","offset":1075},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1100},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":1110},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":1259},{"uri":"Crustacea","surface_form":"crustacea","offset":1270},{"uri":"Mollusk","surface_form":"mollusk","offset":1313},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"biodiversity","offset":1493},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":1544},{"uri":"Bohol_(province)","surface_form":"Bohol","offset":1701},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalties","offset":1739},{"uri":"Barangay","surface_form":"barangay","offset":1760},{"uri":"Neighbourhood","surface_form":"neighbourhood","offset":1776}]}
