The game was inspired by the 2011 film \"Drive\" and the 2006 film \"Cocaine Cowboys\".\nDevelopment.\nThe developers said that they \"wanted it to be disturbing and we wanted people to feel the violence\". They made the graphics pixel art to make sure the game was not controversial. A developer, Jonatan S\u00F6derstr\u00F6m started making a game called Super Carnage, which was very similar to Hotline Miami. The aim of the game was to kill as many people as possible. The game was left unfinished because of difficulties coding the AI.\nBefore starting development, the developers wanted inspiration, so they watched some movies like Kick-Ass, Drive and Cocaine Cowboys. They wanted to raise questions about what it meant to kill a virtual person in a video game.

They had some problems with Games Maker, because they were using an old version. Weldin claimed he liked games that were just games, but S\u00F6derstr\u00F6m wanted the player to think about the game's meaning.\nThe developers said that the AI was the hardest thing to create in the game.\nStory and Gameplay.\nThe player controls an un-named hero (who fans call Jacket), who's gradually losing his mind.
