{"id":467372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastase","text":"e=\"preserve\">Diastases are a group of enzymes which break down starch into the sugar maltose. Diastase was the first enzyme discovered. It was got from malt solution in 1833 by Anselme Payen and Jean-Fran\u00E7ois Persoz, chemists at a French sugar factory.\nThe name \"diastase\" comes from the Greek word \u03B4\u03B9\u03AC\u03C3\u03C4\u03B1\u03C3\u03B9\u03C2 (diastasis). It means a parting or separation. The enzymes simply split the starch molecule. Today, diastase means any \u03B1-, \u03B2-, or \u03B3-amylase that can break down carbohydrates.\nA\u2013B + H2O \u2192 A\u2013OH + B\u2013H","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enzymes","surface_form":"enzymes","offset":38},{"uri":"Starch","surface_form":"starch","offset":63},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":79},{"uri":"Maltose","surface_form":"maltose","offset":85},{"uri":"Malt","surface_form":"malt","offset":152},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":157},{"uri":"Anselme_Payen","surface_form":"Anselme Payen","offset":177},{"uri":"Amylase","surface_form":"amylase","offset":441}]}
