{"id":467377,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Highway_401","text":"Ontario Highway 401, also called King's Highway 401, is a provincial highway in southern Ontario, Canada. It is 817.9 kilometres (508.2 miles) long. It starts near Ontario's border with Quebec, where the road is called Quebec Autoroute 20. The western end of the highway is in Windsor.\nConstruction on the highway started in 1947. By 1952, three different parts of the highway were finished, with the three parts connected by 1964. In 2013, another part of the highway was started. This part would extend the highway to the New International Trade Crossing at the Canadian-U.S. border near Detroit.\nIn 2008, part of the highway between Trenton and Toronto was called the \"Highway of Heroes\". This was because many Canadian soldiers who were killed overseas arrived at the Trenton airforce base. Their bodies were then transported along the highway to Toronto.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"provincial","offset":58},{"uri":"Highway","surface_form":"highway","offset":69},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":89},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":98},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":186},{"uri":"Quebec_Autoroute_20","surface_form":"Quebec Autoroute 20","offset":219},{"uri":"Windsor%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Windsor","offset":277},{"uri":"New_International_Trade_Crossing","surface_form":"New International Trade Crossing","offset":524},{"uri":"Trenton%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Trenton","offset":636},{"uri":"CFB_Trenton","surface_form":"the Trenton airforce base","offset":768}]}
