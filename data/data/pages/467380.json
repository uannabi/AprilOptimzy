{"id":467380,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence","text":"Iridescence is a physical property of some surfaces. Their colour appears to change as the angle of view or illumination changes.\nExamples of natural iridescence are common. It can be seen in soap bubbles, butterfly wings and sea shells, and certain minerals. These are structural colours caused by microstructures which interfere with light.\nThe physical process which causes iridescence is usually interference.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soap_bubble","surface_form":"soap bubble","offset":192},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterfly","offset":206},{"uri":"Sea_shell","surface_form":"sea shell","offset":226},{"uri":"Minerals","surface_form":"minerals","offset":250},{"uri":"Structural_colour","surface_form":"structural colour","offset":270},{"uri":"Interference","surface_form":"interference","offset":400}]}
