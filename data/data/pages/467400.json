{"id":467400,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubrication","text":"Lubrication is a physical process which allows surfaces to move smoothly against each other. A thin film of lubricant put between the surfaces reduces friction and wear on the surfaces, and keeps temperatures from rising too far. The lubricant film can be a solid/liquid dispersion, a liquid, a liquid-liquid dispersion (a grease) or, exceptionally, a solid or gas.\nExamples are the use of oil in machinery, the function of tears in eyes and synovial fluid in joints.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physical","offset":17},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":26},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":47},{"uri":"Friction","surface_form":"friction","offset":151},{"uri":"Wear","surface_form":"wear","offset":164},{"uri":"Grease","surface_form":"grease","offset":323},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":390},{"uri":"Machinery","surface_form":"machinery","offset":397},{"uri":"Tears","surface_form":"tears","offset":424},{"uri":"Eyes","surface_form":"eyes","offset":433},{"uri":"Synovial_fluid","surface_form":"synovial fluid","offset":442},{"uri":"Joint","surface_form":"joint","offset":460}]}
