{"id":467478,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives","text":"=\"preserve\">False positives and negatives are to do with practical testing. When performing a practical test, there is the possibility that the result of the test does not show the real situation.\nIn a test, a false positive is when a test result shows that a condition is present but it is not. A false negative is when a test result shows a condition is \"not\" present when in fact it \"is\" present.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
