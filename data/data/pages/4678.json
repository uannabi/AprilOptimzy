{"id":4678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il","text":"Kim Jong-il, birth name Yuri Irsenovich Kim (according to the Soviet Union's records) (, 16 February 1941 \u2013 17 December 2011) was the Supreme Leader of Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) from the time of his father's death in 1994 until his own death in 2011. He was the son of Kim Il-S\u014Fng. Official North Korean propaganda said that Jong-il was born on Mount Paektu (a holy mountain in Korea); but most historians think that he was born near Chabarowsk in the Soviet Union. The North Korean laws made him permanent ruler of North Korea for life. He was sometimes referred to as the \"Dear Leader\", but this was not an official title. His official title was \"Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea\", \"Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army\" and \"General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea\". Many people in North Korea were imprisoned or killed for speaking out against the Kim regime. Almost everyone in North Korea wore a small pin with a picture of Kim J\u014Fng-Il or Kim Il-S\u014Fng on it.\nThe North Korean government told people of his death through the state media on 19 December 2011. It was said that he had died two days earlier of \"physical and mental over-work\".\nEarly life.\nJong-il was born Yuri Irsenovich Kim on 16 February 1941.\nPersonal life.\nJong-il was a Stalinist. He believed in the North Korean Communist philosophy of Juche (self-reliance). He was afraid to travel on aeroplanes and traveled only on trains. He was well known for his love of movies and luxury goods, especially caviar and Hennessey brand cognac, even though North Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once gave Jong-il a present of a basketball signed by Michael Jordan when he visited North Korea because Jong-il was a fan of the National Basketball Association and of Michael Jordan.\nDeath.\nOn the morning of 17 December 2011, at the age of 69 or 70, Jong-il died of a heart attack while traveling. His funeral was held on 28 December, and as a result, Kim Jong-un was then elected as the new leader of North Korea. On 13 April 2012, Kim Jong-il was made Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission and Eternal General Secretary of the Workers Party of Korea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Korean name"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Democratic_People%27s_Republic_of_Korea","surface_form":"Democratic People's Republic of Korea","offset":152},{"uri":"Kim_Il-Sung","surface_form":"Kim Il-S\u014Fng","offset":295},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":330},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":421},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":478},{"uri":"Regime","surface_form":"regime","offset":926},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1051},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":1099},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":1105},{"uri":"Human_body","surface_form":"physical","offset":1182},{"uri":"Mental","surface_form":"mental","offset":1195},{"uri":"Stalinism","surface_form":"Stalinist","offset":1313},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"Communist","offset":1356},{"uri":"Juche","surface_form":"Juche","offset":1380},{"uri":"Aeroplane","surface_form":"aeroplane","offset":1430},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"train","offset":1462},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":1504},{"uri":"Caviar","surface_form":"caviar","offset":1540},{"uri":"Cognac","surface_form":"cognac","offset":1567},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1653},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"Secretary of State","offset":1667},{"uri":"Madeleine_Albright","surface_form":"Madeleine Albright","offset":1686},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":1738},{"uri":"Michael_Jordan","surface_form":"Michael Jordan","offset":1759},{"uri":"National_Basketball_Association","surface_form":"National Basketball Association","offset":1835},{"uri":"Kim_Jong-un","surface_form":"Kim Jong-un","offset":2059},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":2109}]}
