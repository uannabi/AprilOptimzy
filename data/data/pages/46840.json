{"id":46840,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_%2790/The_Greens","text":"Alliance '90/The Greens (), commonly referred to as \"(The) Greens\", is a political party in Germany. It was formed in 1992 by the Western German party \"Die Gr\u00FCnen\" and the Eastern German \"B\u00FCndnis '90\". Its main interests are ecology, civil rights, equality between men and women and the chances of immigrants in the German society. Their motto is \"now, for tomorrow\".\nEarly years.\nIn the 1970s, there were a lot of protests against nuclear power in Germany. The protesters had no support in the political parties in Germany. So they got the idea to found their own party.\nThis Party was founded under the Name Die Gr\u00FCnen in Karlsruhe on January 13th, 1980.\nSince their aims were for civil rights and ecology, a lot of former Anti Vietnam War protesters joined the party.\nThe Greens were pacifists and strictly against nuclear weapons. They wanted to reach a de-militarized Europe.\nLeaders.\nFirst chiefs of the party were Herbert Gruhl and Petra Kelly. After a short while some right-winged people left the party, so they became a left-winged party.\nInfluence.\nIn the old GDR, a Green party was founded in 1989 and joined to the Western Greens in 1990. In 1993 the B\u00FCndnis 90 - a civil rights movement from the former GDR - and Die Gr\u00FCnen joined them.\nIn 1998 they joined the federal government under Gerhard Schr\u00F6der together with the Social democrats.\nProgramme.\nThe Greens are interested in ecology, so one of their main issues is saving the earth - especially the climate - without using nuclear power.\nThe second main issue of the Greens is gender mainstraming.\nThe third issue are the integration and the chances of immigrants in Germany.\nIn the foreign policy the Green changed their position in their first period in federal government. Before that time they wanted German soldiers only to allow peace keeping missions of the United Nations, many Greens wanted a de-militarized Germany. After their legislative period - with main influence of foreign secretary Fischer - they accepted to join international military missions e.g. in Afganisthan. But their main issue is to avoid conflicts by development policy and international cooperation. Main issues of foreign policy are international envoirementional and climate saving projects like the Kyoto protocoll, the development of the European Union and a reform of the international law like the installing of the International Crime Court in The Hague.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":92},{"uri":"1992","surface_form":"1992","offset":118},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":225},{"uri":"Civil_rights","surface_form":"civil rights","offset":234},{"uri":"Immigrant","surface_form":"immigrant","offset":298},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":388},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":415},{"uri":"Nuclear_power","surface_form":"nuclear power","offset":432},{"uri":"Karlsruhe","surface_form":"Karlsruhe","offset":624},{"uri":"January_13","surface_form":"January 13","offset":637},{"uri":"1980","surface_form":"1980","offset":651},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":730},{"uri":"Pacifism","surface_form":"pacifists","offset":787},{"uri":"Herbert_Gruhl","surface_form":"Herbert Gruhl","offset":921},{"uri":"Petra_Kelly","surface_form":"Petra Kelly","offset":939},{"uri":"GDR","surface_form":"GDR","offset":1071},{"uri":"1989","surface_form":"1989","offset":1105},{"uri":"1990","surface_form":"1990","offset":1146},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":1155},{"uri":"1998","surface_form":"1998","offset":1254},{"uri":"Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der","surface_form":"Gerhard Schr\u00F6der","offset":1300}]}
