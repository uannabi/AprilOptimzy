One in W\u00FCrzburg and the other in Munich.\nIn January 1946 the CSU was founded for the whole of Bavaria.\nAll state elections of Bavaria were won by the CSU. Sometimes the CSU had to make some coalitions with the Bayernpartei (Bavarian Party), the FDP or the SPD.\nIn the federal government the CSU always joins with the CDU.\nThe CSU is more conservative than the CDU.\nOne very famous leader of the CSU was Franz Josef Strau\u00DF. Sometimes he was well known for the good that he did. Other times because of scandals.\nProgramme.\nThe CSU is a very conservative party according to the people of Bavaria, who mainly live in the countryside and smaller towns and villages.\nTraditionally it tried to make a compromise between conservative tradition and social welfare.\nCurrently it leans to more free market beliefs instead of social care.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservative","offset":83},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":119},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":135},{"uri":"Federal_republic","surface_form":"federal","offset":151},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":159},{"uri":"Bundestag","surface_form":"Bundestag","offset":182},{"uri":"CDU","surface_form":"CDU","offset":209},{"uri":"Horst_Seehofer","surface_form":"Horst Seehofer","offset":312},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrzburg","surface_form":"W\u00FCrzburg","offset":388},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":414},{"uri":"Coalition","surface_form":"coalition","offset":571},{"uri":"FDP","surface_form":"FDP","offset":626},{"uri":"SPD","surface_form":"SPD","offset":637},{"uri":"Franz_Josef_Strau%C3%9F","surface_form":"Franz Josef Strau\u00DF","offset":784},{"uri":"Scandal","surface_form":"scandal","offset":881}]}
