{"id":468426,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frugal_Gourmet","text":"\"The Frugal Gourmet\" is an American half-hour cooking show. The show started around 1973 at Tacoma's public-TV station KTPS-TV. It was first called \"Cooking Fish Creatively\". Later it was renamed \"The Frugal Gourmet\". The award winning program was hosted by Jeff Smith.\nHistory.\nJeff Smith was the chaplain at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington from 1966 to 1972. In 1965, he taught a cooking class called \u201DFood as Sacrament and Celebration\". In 1972, he opened and ran a restaurant called the Chaplain\u2019s Pantry. In 1973, a local PBS television station KTPS-TV offered him his own cooking show, called \"Cooking Fish Creatively\". \"I had a producer who couldn't produce, a director who couldn't direct, a technician who couldn't tech, and I wasn't so good, either\", according to Smith. The show received two Emmy nominations. The show won a 'Best of the West' Award for Educational Television in 1976. After several seasons it was renamed \"The Frugal Gourmet\". The name change was suggested by his wife, Patty.\nThe Frugal Gourmet ran on PBS from 1983 to 1997. It was PBS's most popular cooking show. Smith always wore a blue and white striped apron that became his \"trademark\". In 1989, during the \"Three Ancient Cuisines\" run, Smith was joined by Craig Wollam, a professionally trained Chef. Smith met Wollam by accident in a Chicago restaurant and he was hired the next day. He stayed until the show was cancelled in 1997.\nFor the first seven seasons, the show was produced by WTTW in Chicago. From 1991, it was produced by KQED in San Francisco, and A La Carte Communications.\nFormat.\nDuring each show, Smith followed a recipe showing how to prepare a dish. He goes to different places by showing food from many different cultures. The show always ended with Smith saying \"Until I see you again, this is the Frugal Gourmet; I bid you peace, bye-bye\". Smith would remind his audience that \"frugal\" doesn't mean cheap. It means that you don't waste money. And \"gourmet\" means loving good food and wine.\nTheme song.\nThe theme music for \"The Frugal Gourmet\" was the Bourree movement from \"Water Music\" by George Frideric Handel.\nSyndication.\nFrom 1989 to 1997, reruns of earlier seasons of \"The Frugal Gourmet\" aired on Lifetime. When \"The Frugal Gourmet\" aired on Lifetime, episodes ran for about 21 minutes to make room for commercials, and several parts were cut. In 1991, GNT in Brazil began airing a Portugal dubbed version of the show entitled \"Frugal Gourmet\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":27},{"uri":"Cooking_show","surface_form":"cooking show","offset":46},{"uri":"Jeff_Smith","surface_form":"Jeff Smith","offset":258},{"uri":"Chaplain","surface_form":"chaplain","offset":298},{"uri":"University_of_Puget_Sound","surface_form":"University of Puget Sound","offset":314},{"uri":"Tacoma%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Tacoma, Washington","offset":343},{"uri":"Pedagogy","surface_form":"taught","offset":393},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"class","offset":410},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":489},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":547},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television station","offset":551},{"uri":"Cooking_show","surface_form":"cooking show","offset":598},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":655},{"uri":"Television_director","surface_form":"director","offset":688},{"uri":"Emmy_nomination","surface_form":"Emmy nomination","offset":823},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":1052},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":1135},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":1144},{"uri":"Stripe","surface_form":"stripe","offset":1150},{"uri":"Apron","surface_form":"apron","offset":1158},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":1279},{"uri":"Chef","surface_form":"Chef","offset":1302},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"show","offset":1412},{"uri":"Cancelled","surface_form":"cancelled","offset":1421},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"seasons","offset":1460},{"uri":"Produced","surface_form":"produced","offset":1482},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":1502},{"uri":"Television_program","surface_form":"show","offset":1615},{"uri":"Recipe","surface_form":"recipe","offset":1638},{"uri":"Prepare","surface_form":"prepare","offset":1660},{"uri":"Dish","surface_form":"dish","offset":1670},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1740},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":1892},{"uri":"Cheap","surface_form":"cheap","offset":1928},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":1965},{"uri":"Water_Music_(Handel)","surface_form":"Water Music","offset":2103},{"uri":"George_Frideric_Handel","surface_form":"George Frideric Handel","offset":2119}]}
