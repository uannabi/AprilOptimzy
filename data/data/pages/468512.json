{"id":468512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_hub","text":"e=\"preserve\">A transport hub (also transport interchange) is a place where passengers and cargo are exchanged between transport modes. Public transport hubs include train stations, rapid transit stations, bus stops, tram stop, airports and ferry slips. Freight hubs include classification yards, seaports and truck terminals, or combinations of these. For private transport, the parking lot functions as a hub.\nDelta Air Lines first used the hub and spoke system for aviation in 1955 from its hub in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. This was to compete with Eastern Air Lines. FedEx adopted the hub and spoke model for overnight package delivery during the 1970s. When the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, Delta's hub and spoke system was used by several airlines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":75},{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":90},{"uri":"Transport","surface_form":"transport","offset":118},{"uri":"Mode","surface_form":"mode","offset":128},{"uri":"Public_transport","surface_form":"Public transport","offset":135},{"uri":"Train_station","surface_form":"train station","offset":165},{"uri":"Metro_station","surface_form":"rapid transit station","offset":181},{"uri":"Bus_stop","surface_form":"bus stop","offset":205},{"uri":"Tram_stop","surface_form":"tram stop","offset":216},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":227},{"uri":"Ferry_slip","surface_form":"ferry slip","offset":240},{"uri":"Classification_yard","surface_form":"classification yard","offset":274},{"uri":"Seaport","surface_form":"seaport","offset":296},{"uri":"Terminal","surface_form":"terminal","offset":315},{"uri":"Parking_lot","surface_form":"parking lot","offset":379},{"uri":"Delta_Air_Lines","surface_form":"Delta Air Lines","offset":411},{"uri":"Aviation","surface_form":"aviation","offset":467},{"uri":"Atlanta%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Atlanta, Georgia","offset":500},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":518},{"uri":"Compete","surface_form":"compete","offset":545},{"uri":"Eastern_Air_Lines","surface_form":"Eastern Air Lines","offset":558},{"uri":"FedEx_Corporation","surface_form":"FedEx","offset":577},{"uri":"Airline_Deregulation_Act","surface_form":"deregulated","offset":694}]}
