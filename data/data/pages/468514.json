{"id":468514,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_mite","text":"Cheese mites are mites which live in food, grain and plant leaves.\nThey are sometimes found in flour but prefer cheese. Refrigerated cheese is not usually affected as they prefer warm, damp foods. Cheese mites are used to make certain cheeses. Milbenk\u00E4se and Mimolette are two examples. The action of the mites on the surface of these cheeses adds to the flavor. It also gives them a distinctive appearance. A 2010 SEM study found that Milbenk\u00E4se cheese was produced using \"Tyrolichus casei\" mites, while Mimolette cheese used \"Acarus siro\" mites (also known as flour mites).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mite","surface_form":"mite","offset":17},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":43},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant leaves","offset":53},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":95},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":112},{"uri":"Refrigerate","surface_form":"Refrigerate","offset":120},{"uri":"Warm","surface_form":"warm","offset":179},{"uri":"Damp","surface_form":"damp","offset":185},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":235},{"uri":"Milbenk%C3%A4se","surface_form":"Milbenk\u00E4se","offset":244},{"uri":"Mimolette","surface_form":"Mimolette","offset":259},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":277},{"uri":"Flavor","surface_form":"flavor","offset":355},{"uri":"Scanning_electron_microscope","surface_form":"SEM","offset":415},{"uri":"Tyrolichus_casei","surface_form":"Tyrolichus casei","offset":474},{"uri":"Acarus_siro","surface_form":"Acarus siro","offset":528}]}
