{"id":468603,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme","text":"e=\"preserve\">A grapheme is a written mark which corresponds to a spoken sound, or a bit of written language (orthography). It roughly corresponds to a phoneme in speech.\nGraphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols of any of the world's writing systems. The separate items on a keyboard all produce graphemes when writing in the appropriate software.\nA grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme.\nA grapheme is an abstract concept. A glyph is a specific shape that represents that grapheme, in a specific typeface. For example, the abstract concept of \"the Arabic numeral one\" is a grapheme which has different glyphs in different typefaces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Speech","surface_form":"spoken","offset":65},{"uri":"Orthography","surface_form":"orthography","offset":109},{"uri":"Phoneme","surface_form":"phoneme","offset":151},{"uri":"Letters","surface_form":"letters","offset":199},{"uri":"Typographic_ligature","surface_form":"typographic ligature","offset":208},{"uri":"Chinese_character","surface_form":"Chinese character","offset":231},{"uri":"Numerical_digit","surface_form":"numerical digit","offset":251},{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"punctuation","offset":269},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"writing system","offset":339},{"uri":"Keyboard_(computer)","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":380},{"uri":"Meaning","surface_form":"meaning","offset":485},{"uri":"Abstract","surface_form":"abstract","offset":572},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":581},{"uri":"Glyph","surface_form":"glyph","offset":592},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"typeface","offset":663}]}
