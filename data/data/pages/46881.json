{"id":46881,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation","text":"=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a binary operation, often denoted *, on a set is a way of combining a pair of elements in that set that results in another element of the set. For example, if we take a pair of natural numbers and let the operation * be addition, then their sum is also a natural number, and is the result of applying this particular binary operation. Another example of an operation on the natural numbers is multiplication. For instance, take the natural numbers 2 and 3. When multiplied together they give 6, another natural number.\nOthers: The sum between matrices. The composition of functions. The union and the intersection of sets are also two different binary operations on the set of all sets, or on subsets in a power set.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":15},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":70},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":205},{"uri":"Sum","surface_form":"sum","offset":269},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrices","offset":571},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"functions","offset":600},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"union","offset":615},{"uri":"Intersection","surface_form":"intersection","offset":629}]}
