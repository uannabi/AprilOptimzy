{"id":468825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwent_River","text":"The Derwent is a river in Tasmania, Australia. It was named after the River Derwent, Cumbria, by British Commodore John Hayes who explored it in 1793. The name is Brythonic Celtic for \"valley thick with oaks\".\nJohn Hays placed the name \"Derwent River\" only in the upper part of the river. Matthew Flinders placed the name on all of the river.\nThe banks of the Derwent were once covered by forests and occupied by Aborigines. European settlers farmed the area and during the 20th century many dams were built on its tributaries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":26},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":36},{"uri":"River_Derwent%2C_Cumbria","surface_form":"River Derwent, Cumbria","offset":70},{"uri":"John_Hayes_(explorer)","surface_form":"John Hayes","offset":115},{"uri":"Brythonic_languages","surface_form":"Brythonic","offset":163}]}
