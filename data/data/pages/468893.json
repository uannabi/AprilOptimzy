The headwaters of the river rise below Donkins Hill. The river flows in a south-westerly direction. It empties into Prince Frederick Harbour. Then the river flows to the York Sound and the Indian Ocean.\nThe river was named by the explorer Philip Parker King in 1820. He was on the \"Mermaid\" while making charts in the area. The river was named after the surgeon on the \"Mermaid\", James Hunter.\nThe river has two waterfalls. They are the Hunter Falls and the Donkin Falls. Both falls drop. A large rock formation is at the mouth of the river. The area is popular with tourism companies. Wilderness cruises operate in the area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kimberley_(Western_Australia)","surface_form":"Kimberley","offset":27},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":37},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":47},{"uri":"Headwater","surface_form":"headwater","offset":70},{"uri":"Donkins_Hill","surface_form":"Donkins Hill","offset":105},{"uri":"Prince_Frederick_Harbour","surface_form":"Prince Frederick Harbour","offset":182},{"uri":"York_Sound","surface_form":"York Sound","offset":236},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":255},{"uri":"Philip_Parker_King","surface_form":"Philip Parker King","offset":305},{"uri":"Surgeon","surface_form":"surgeon","offset":420},{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"waterfall","offset":478},{"uri":"Hunter_Falls","surface_form":"Hunter Falls","offset":503},{"uri":"Donkin_Falls","surface_form":"Donkin Falls","offset":524},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":633},{"uri":"Wilderness","surface_form":"Wilderness","offset":652}]}
