{"id":4689,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy)","text":"In astronomy, voids are the empty spaces between filaments. Both filaments and Voids are one of the largest-scale structures in the Universe. There are no or few galaxies in voids. Most voids have a diameter of 11 to 150 Mpc.\nEspecially large voids are the empty spaces without many superclusters.\nThese voids are sometimes called supervoids'\".\nA 1994 official counting (\"The structure of the Universe traced by rich clusters of galaxies.\", see References) lists a total of 27 supervoids with a distance of up to 740 Mpc. Some of supervoids chosen from the list are given below.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":3},{"uri":"Filament_(astronomy)","surface_form":"filaments","offset":49},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":114},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"Universe","offset":132},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxies","offset":162},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":199},{"uri":"Parsec","surface_form":"Mpc","offset":221},{"uri":"Supercluster","surface_form":"supercluster","offset":283},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":347}]}
