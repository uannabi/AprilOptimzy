{"id":469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May","text":"May is the fifth month of the year, coming between April and June. It has 31 days. The month of May might have been named for the Roman goddess Maia, or more likely the Roman goddess of fertility Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May.\nMay never begins or ends on the same day of the week as any other month.\nMay's flower is the Lily of the Valley. Its birthstone is the emerald. The meaning of the emerald is success in love.\nThe Month.\nMay comes between April and June and is the fifth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar. It is one of seven months to have 31 days. In the older Roman calendar, May was the third month of the year. It is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of November in the other. May is likely to have been named after the Roman goddess Maia, though there is a theory that May might have its name from the Latin \"Maiores\", meaning \"Seniors\". The same theory suggests that June would then be named from \"Iuniores\", meaning \"Juniors\".\nMay is the only month that does not begin or end on the same day of the week as any other month in any year.\nIn common years, May starts on the same day of the week as August of the previous year, and in leap years, March and November of the previous year. In common years, May finishes on the same day of the week as August and November of the previous year, and in leap years, March and June of the previous year. In leap years and years immediately after that, May starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year.\nEvery year, May both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as January of the following year, as each other's first and last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In years immediately before common years, May starts on the same day of the week as October of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, April and July of the following year. In years immediately before common years, May finishes on the same day of the week as February and October of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, July of the following year.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, May is in late Spring, and May Day on May 1 and Walpurgis Night, during the night of April 30 to May 1, are symbolic of the transition from winter to summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, it is in autumn, and comes just before the Antarctic winter, when emperor penguins breed there.\nEvents in May.\nSpecial devotions to the Virgin Mary take place in May.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":17},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":30},{"uri":"April","surface_form":"April","offset":51},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":61},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":77},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman goddess","offset":130},{"uri":"Maia","surface_form":"Maia","offset":144},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":175},{"uri":"Fertility","surface_form":"fertility","offset":186},{"uri":"Bona_Dea","surface_form":"Bona Dea","offset":196},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":317},{"uri":"Lily_of_the_Valley","surface_form":"Lily of the Valley","offset":331},{"uri":"Birthstone","surface_form":"birthstone","offset":355},{"uri":"Emerald","surface_form":"emerald","offset":373},{"uri":"April","surface_form":"April","offset":458},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":468},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":515},{"uri":"Roman_calendar","surface_form":"Roman calendar","offset":591},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":652},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":672},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"autumn","offset":699},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":719},{"uri":"Hemisphere","surface_form":"hemisphere","offset":748},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":793},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"goddess","offset":865},{"uri":"Maia","surface_form":"Maia","offset":873},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":1008},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":1237},{"uri":"March","surface_form":"March","offset":1285},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":1295},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":1398},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":1458},{"uri":"February","surface_form":"February","offset":1575},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":1678},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":1868},{"uri":"April","surface_form":"April","offset":1943},{"uri":"July","surface_form":"July","offset":1953},{"uri":"February","surface_form":"February","offset":2067},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":2190},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"Spring","offset":2226},{"uri":"May_Day","surface_form":"May Day","offset":2238},{"uri":"May_1","surface_form":"May 1","offset":2249},{"uri":"Walpurgis_Night","surface_form":"Walpurgis Night","offset":2259},{"uri":"April_30","surface_form":"April 30","offset":2296},{"uri":"May_1","surface_form":"May 1","offset":2308},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":2351},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":2361},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":2376},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"autumn","offset":2406},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctic","offset":2440},{"uri":"Emperor_penguin","surface_form":"emperor penguin","offset":2463},{"uri":"Virgin_Mary","surface_form":"Virgin Mary","offset":2533}]}
