{"id":469128,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Mortal_Hands","text":"\"In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age\" is a 2009 book by Stephanie Cooke. The book says that nuclear energy failed to develop in the way its planners hoped, and explores the military and civilian sides of nuclear energy. In the book, Cooke says that we are not close to solving the nuclear waste problem, and that \"the billions spent by government on nuclear over the past sixty years crowded out other energy options\". The book suggests that there are practical reasons why nuclear reactors are unlikely to provide a solution to the global climate change problem.\nStephanie Cooke has written about the nuclear industry since the 1980s, and is a contributor to the \"Bulletin of Atomic Scientists\". There have been many media interviews about \"In Mortal Hands\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stephanie_Cooke","surface_form":"Stephanie Cooke","offset":77},{"uri":"Nuclear_power","surface_form":"nuclear energy","offset":113},{"uri":"Nuclear_waste","surface_form":"nuclear waste","offset":302},{"uri":"Nuclear_reactor","surface_form":"nuclear reactor","offset":495},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":561},{"uri":"Bulletin_of_Atomic_Scientists","surface_form":"Bulletin of Atomic Scientists","offset":686}]}
