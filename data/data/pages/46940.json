{"id":46940,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership","text":"=\"preserve\">Ownership means total possession or control of property, which may be a business, an object, land or real estate, intellectual property or some other kind of property.\nOwnership can be divided, or shared between owners. Ownership has no legal value until money is added into the situation. The surplus, or profits, or money value of what is owned is divided according to the ownership accounts.\nOwnership is needed for the development of the capitalist socio-economic system. The concept of ownership has existed for thousands of years and in all cultures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Possession","surface_form":"possession","offset":34},{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"property","offset":59},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":84},{"uri":"Personal_property","surface_form":"object","offset":97},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":105},{"uri":"Real_estate","surface_form":"real estate","offset":113},{"uri":"Intellectual_property","surface_form":"intellectual property","offset":126},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":267},{"uri":"Surplus","surface_form":"surplus","offset":306},{"uri":"Profit","surface_form":"profits","offset":318},{"uri":"Capitalist","surface_form":"capitalist","offset":454},{"uri":"Years","surface_form":"years","offset":542},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":559}]}
