When DeMakes decided to move north and attend the University of Florida, the band broke up. Less Than Jake was formed on July 13, 1992. The band got their name from Fiorello's dog, Jake, who was usually treated better than the rest of the household, so everything was \"less than Jake\". The band released their debut studio album, \"Pezcore\" on August 22, 1995 through Dill Records.\nTheir eighth studio album \"See the Light\" was released on November 12, 2013.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"American","offset":21},{"uri":"Ska_punk","surface_form":"ska punk","offset":30},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":39},{"uri":"Gainesville%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Gainesville","offset":49},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":62},{"uri":"Port_Charlotte%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Port Charlotte","offset":280},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":296},{"uri":"University_of_Florida","surface_form":"University of Florida","offset":355},{"uri":"Pezcore","surface_form":"Pezcore","offset":636},{"uri":"Dill_Records","surface_form":"Dill Records","offset":672},{"uri":"See_the_Light_(Less_Than_Jake_album)","surface_form":"See the Light","offset":713}]}
