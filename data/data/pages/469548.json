(as she quoted from the liner notes.)\n\"Eugene-based composer Rebecca Oswald has two of the loveliest pieces on this disc of modern symphonic works performed by several orchestras, in this case the Moravian Philharmonic. Movie directors take note: \u201CFinding the Murray River\u201D could work as a film soundtrack behind on a long pastoral shot of a carriage riding down a country road.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pianist","surface_form":"pianist","offset":26},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":64},{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":137},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":145},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":182},{"uri":"Choral_ensemble","surface_form":"choral ensemble","offset":286},{"uri":"Video_games","surface_form":"video games","offset":358},{"uri":"Documentary","surface_form":"documentary","offset":429},{"uri":"Classical","surface_form":"classical","offset":465},{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":487},{"uri":"American_Prize_in_Composition","surface_form":"American Prize in Composition","offset":549},{"uri":"Beauty","surface_form":"beauty","offset":804},{"uri":"Recording","surface_form":"recording","offset":818},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":970}]}
