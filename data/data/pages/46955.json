{"id":46955,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Cadets","text":"The Royal Canadian Air Cadets is a program for Canadian youth. It is supported by sponsors in the community and Canada's Canadian Armed Forces funded by the Department of National Defence. There are about 450 Air Cadet squadrons, located in every province and territory in Canada. The two other cadet programs for youth in Canada are the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and the Royal Canadian Army Cadets.\nPeople between the ages of 12 and 18 inclusive can join this program for free, and they are led by the officers of the Canadian Forces Cadet Instructor Cadre.\nAims and Motto.\nThe aim of the Air Cadets is to \"develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness; and to stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land and air activities of the Canadian Armed Forces\". The Motto of the Air Cadets is \"To Learn, to Serve, to Advance\". It was created by Robert Myles Colwell in 1966 while he was a cadet with 625 (Southern Victoria) Squadron in Perth-Andover, New Brunswick. The cadet program focuses on social development, decision-making and leadership. As cadets acquire skills and knowledge, they pass it along to younger cadets.\nRanking.\nThe rank system in Air Cadets is founded in that ranking system used by the non-commissioned member's ranks of the pre-unification Royal Canadian Air Force with some modifications.
