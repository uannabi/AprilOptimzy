Sears managers decided to put all of those workers into one building. They wanted of space. Sears hired architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) to design one of the largest office buildings in the world. Architect Bruce Graham and structural engineer Fazlur Khan designed the building.\nSears and the City of Chicago approved the design. Steel was transported from South Chicago. The first steel was put in place in April 1971. The tower was completed in May 1973. It cost about US$150\u00A0million to build. That is equivalent to $800 million in 2014.\nThe building was built with a fire sprinkler system, even though it wasn't required at the time. There are about 40,000 sprinkler heads in the building. The sprinkler system cost $4 million.\nIn February 1982, two television antennas were added to the tower. That made the building tall. On June 5, 2000, the western antenna was made longer to improve reception of local NBC.
