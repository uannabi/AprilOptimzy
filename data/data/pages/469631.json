A long-term exile, he was given permission to make his first return trip to Vietnam in 2005. Nh\u1EA5t H\u1EA1nh has published more than 100 books, including more than 40 in English.\nOn 11 November 2014, Nh\u1EA5t H\u1EA1nh was hospitalized with a severe brain hemorrhage. There are signs that a full recovery may be possible.\nHe is suggesting that peace and joy is always accessible for all people. One way to discover that joy, is by what they call \"mindful\" meditation. Which is a type of meditation that concentrates on your breathing and embracing everything that comes up on your consciousness, without interpreting it with thought and critisism. But accompanying it with the great power of forgiveness, understanding and realisation of the present moment, which is also a very important point of reference in his teachings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":47},{"uri":"Zen","surface_form":"Zen","offset":58},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":62},{"uri":"Bhikkhu","surface_form":"monk","offset":71},{"uri":"Peace_activist","surface_form":"peace activist","offset":103},{"uri":"Plum_Village","surface_form":"Plum Village","offset":135},{"uri":"Dordogne","surface_form":"Dordogne","offset":165},{"uri":"Th%E1%BB%ABa_Thi%C3%AAn_Hu%E1%BA%BF","surface_form":"Th\u1EEBa Thi\u00EAn Hu\u1EBF","offset":220},{"uri":"Engaged_Buddhism","surface_form":"Engaged Buddhism","offset":274},{"uri":"Brain_hemorrhage","surface_form":"brain hemorrhage","offset":573}]}
