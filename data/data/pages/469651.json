{"id":469651,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosan_mountain_dog","text":"The Formosan Mountain Dog (or Formosan) is a breed of small or medium dog. They live in Taiwan. These dogs are also known as \"Taiwanese Dog/Canis\" (), \"Taiwanese Native Dog\" () or \"Takasago Dog\" (). They are well-adapted to the uneven and thickly forested terrain of Taiwan. They had become a semi-wild breed earlier.\nFormosans can be trained as hunting dogs, guard dogs, rescue dogs, or simply as companions. Formosan dogs can make good family pets but still have a strong hunting instinct.\nHowever, now the pureblood Formosan Mountain Dog is still close to extinction. This is due to limited conservation efforts of the Taiwanese and their government.\n\"Native Dog\" () is the common name in Taiwan nowadays to indicate that the dog is an offspring of Formosan with foreign dogs. It is commonly confused with the \"Taiwan Native Dog\" ().","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":45},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":70},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":88},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"well-adapted","offset":208},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":247},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":256},{"uri":"Semi-","surface_form":"semi-","offset":293},{"uri":"Wild","surface_form":"wild","offset":298},{"uri":"Hunting_dog","surface_form":"hunting dog","offset":346},{"uri":"Guard_dog","surface_form":"guard dog","offset":360},{"uri":"Rescue_dog","surface_form":"rescue dog","offset":372},{"uri":"Companion_dog","surface_form":"companions","offset":398},{"uri":"Instinct","surface_form":"instinct","offset":482},{"uri":"Mountain_dog","surface_form":"Mountain Dog","offset":528},{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":594},{"uri":"Offspring","surface_form":"offspring","offset":739}]}
