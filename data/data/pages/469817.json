{"id":469817,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandee_of_Spain","text":"The Grandes de Espa\u00F1a are the highest ranking members of the Spanish nobility. Their ranks are made up of those nobles holding the most important historical landed titles in Spain. In the modern day, many of these titles overlap or are held by the same person. Strategic marriages have collected titles under certain noble houses over time.\nIn the modern day, all Grandees have the status 'of the first class'. It implies neither privilege nor power.\nAn individual is a grandee if he or she holds a \"Grandeza de Espa\u00F1a\", regardless of possession of a title of nobility. Normally, each \"grandeza\" is granted with a title, but this was not always the case. Also, a \"Grandeza de Espa\u00F1a\" is normally awarded along with every ducal title. Several members of both Spanish and French nobility were made Grandees also.\nAddress.\nGrandees and their consorts are entitled to the style of \"The Most Excellent\" (, male, or ', female; abbreviated as \"Excmo. Sr.\" or \"Excma. Sra.\"). In written form, their names are followed by the abbreviation G de E.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_nobility","surface_form":"Spanish nobility","offset":61},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":174},{"uri":"Implication_and_inference","surface_form":"implies","offset":414}]}
