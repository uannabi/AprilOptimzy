{"id":46988,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy_long-legs_spider","text":"The Daddy-Long-Legs Spider (\"Pholcus phalangioides\") is a spider of the family Pholcidae. Its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body. It is often confused with the \"daddy long-legs\", a member of the Opiliones, which are not true (real) spiders. \"P. phalangioides\" has the habit of shaking the web violently when disturbed. This is probably to blur the vision of a predator. Because it is often found on the ceilings of rooms, caves or cellars, it is also called cellar spider. They can easily catch and eat hairy house spiders, mosquitoes, and other insects. When food is scarce, they will prey on their own kind. Because they originally came from the tropics, these spiders do not seem to be aware of seasonal changes and breed at any time of the year.\nThe female holds 20 to 30 eggs in her jaws. Spiderlings are transparent with short legs and change their skin about 5 or 6 times as they grow.\nFemales have a body length of about 9mm, males are slightly smaller.\n\"Crossopriza lyoni\" and \"Physocyclus globosis\" are spiders with a very similar appearance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":58},{"uri":"Pholcidae","surface_form":"Pholcidae","offset":79},{"uri":"Opiliones","surface_form":"Opiliones","offset":211},{"uri":"Crossopriza_lyoni","surface_form":"Crossopriza lyoni","offset":979},{"uri":"Physocyclus_globosis","surface_form":"Physocyclus globosis","offset":1003}]}
