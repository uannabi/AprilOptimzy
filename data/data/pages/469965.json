{"id":469965,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_and_gratifications_theory","text":"=\"preserve\">The Uses and gratifications theory is a theory by Blumer and Katz. It states that different people watch television and movies for different reasons.\nThere may be somebody who will watch a romantic comedy so that they can put themselves in the shoes of the characters and feel love. Somebody may watch \"Breaking Bad\" so that they can join in with social conversation relating to that topic. It may be said that you would watch a television for escapism so that you forget the stress or normal life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":117},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":132},{"uri":"Romantic_comedy","surface_form":"romantic comedy","offset":201},{"uri":"Breaking_Bad","surface_form":"Breaking Bad","offset":315}]}
