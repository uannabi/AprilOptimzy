{"id":47005,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation","text":"A quadratic equation is an equation in the form of formula_1, where \"a\" is not equal to 0. It makes a parabola (a \"U\" shape) when graphed on a coordinate plane.\nWhen people work with quadratic equations, one of the most common things they do is to \"solve\" it. This means to find the points on a coordinate grid where the graphed equation crosses the x-axis, or the horizontal axis. These points are called the \"zeroes\", or \"roots\", of a function. In other words, to solve the equation means to find the value of \"x\" so that formula_1, where the coefficients, \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\", are all real numbers. There are different ways to find out the value of x. Plotting the function on a graph is one way. In the picture on the right, the function crosses the x-axis at the points formula_1 and formula_1.\nGraphing a quadratic equation makes it is very easy to find the roots, but it is not always convenient. So there are different ways to do this using maths.\nFactoring.\nSome quadratic equations, like formula_1, can be factorized. This equation can be written as formula_1, which produces two separate equations, formula_1 and formula_1. This is because when any of the two equations is equal to zero, the original equation is equal to zero because the two equations are multiplied together to form the quadratic equation. From this equation, it is easy to use algebra to find out what the value of \"x\" is. In the first of the two equations, formula_1 and in the second, formula_1. This means that these two values of \"x\" will make the whole quadratic equation equal to zero. The y-coordinate is equal to zero at these values of x, and so the coordinates formula_1 and formula_1 are the places where the graph of the function crosses the x-axis.\nCompleting the square.\nNot all quadratic equations can be factorized, such as formula_1. One of the ways to solve these kinds of equations is called \"completing the square\". This means to find some value for \"k\" below so that:formula_1 for some \"y\". Since formula_1 and formula_1 this means formula_1\nThis last value for \"x\" has two values: formula_1 and formula_1. These are the x-coordinates at the points where the y-coordinates are equal to zero and so the function crosses the x-axis.\nIt is also interesting to note that the vertex of the function, formula_1, can be found from the equation in step 3 above.\nThe quadratic formula.\nThe numbers represented by \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are the same as those in the original equation. For this formula to work properly, \"a\" cannot be equal to 0 for the formula (but really, when \"a\" = 0 in the original equation, it is not quadratic since there is no x-squared term).\nThe factored form of this equation is, where \"s\" and \"t\" are the zeros, \"a\" is a constant, and \"y\" and the two values of \"x\" are ordered pairs which satisfy the equation.\nUsing the quadratic formula.\nformula_1. Solving the two square roots, the value of \"x\" can be either 1.148 or -0.348, which is the same as above.\nUnlike the other methods described above, the quadratic equation will work with every possible value for \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\", even if there are no \"real roots\", that is, places where the graph of the function touches the x-axis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":27},{"uri":"Parabola","surface_form":"parabola","offset":102},{"uri":"Coordinate_plane","surface_form":"coordinate plane","offset":143},{"uri":"Cartesian_coordinate_system","surface_form":"coordinate grid","offset":295},{"uri":"X-axis","surface_form":"x-axis","offset":350},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":437},{"uri":"Coefficient","surface_form":"coefficients","offset":545},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":586},{"uri":"Graph","surface_form":"graph","offset":680},{"uri":"Maths","surface_form":"maths","offset":947},{"uri":"Factorization","surface_form":"factorized","offset":1014},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplied","offset":1266},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":1356},{"uri":"Vertex_(graph_theory)","surface_form":"vertex","offset":2271}]}
