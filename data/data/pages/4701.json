There are many different kinds of aircraft.\nSome aircraft keep in the sky by moving air over their wings. Examples are aeroplanes, helicopters, and gliders. Some aircraft keep in the sky by floating. Examples are balloons and airships.\nMost aircraft use engine power. Examples are aeroplanes, helicopter, and airships. Gliders and balloons use no power. A few aircraft use muscle power.\nBig aeroplanes for transporting people are called \"airliners\". Airliners are the quickest way to travel. Airliners can fly over mountains and bad weather. Airliners have complex technology to make them fly quickly, safely and for less money.\nA few fighter aircraft can fly at 3,200\u00A0km/h (2,000\u00A0mph).\nThe person who drives an aircraft is called the pilot.\nSmallest.\nThe smallest aircraft is a nano-aircraft.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flight","surface_form":"flying","offset":17},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":24},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wings","offset":132},{"uri":"Aeroplane","surface_form":"aeroplanes","offset":152},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopters","offset":164},{"uri":"Glider","surface_form":"gliders","offset":181},{"uri":"Buoyancy","surface_form":"floating","offset":223},{"uri":"Balloon_(aircraft)","surface_form":"balloons","offset":246},{"uri":"Airship","surface_form":"airships","offset":259},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":287},{"uri":"Aeroplane","surface_form":"aeroplane","offset":314},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":326},{"uri":"Airship","surface_form":"airships","offset":342},{"uri":"Human_powered_aircraft","surface_form":"muscle power","offset":406},{"uri":"Airliner","surface_form":"airliner","offset":471},{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":668},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":768}]}
