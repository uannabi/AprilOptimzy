{"id":47012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat","text":"e=\"preserve\">A threat is basically a declaration of intent to inflict punishment or harm or loss on another. However, in many cases the threat is not believed, or may even be a joke. Like other communications a threat has a context, and the context decides its meaning.\nA child who says \"I'll tell my dad\" may learn from the reply \"I'm so scared!\" that the threat is an idle threat: one that is promises harm that that cannot or will not actually be inflicted.\nTo encourage compliance, a threat to do harm may be mixed with an offer to do good, conditional upon what the recipient does. This is sometimes called a throffer. The threat part may be implied, yet effective.\nSome countries, such as the United States, have a legal concept of true threat. A true threat is a threatening communication which can be prosecuted under the law.\nA threat can describe a situation of danger: for example \"a terrorist threat\". Many countries have a system where the government can adjust its security by having official threat levels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":70},{"uri":"Context","surface_form":"context","offset":224},{"uri":"Meaning","surface_form":"meaning","offset":261},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":721},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":782}]}
