{"id":470420,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liria_Palace","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Liria Palace () is a building in Madrid. It is the personal property of the House of Alba.\nThe palace was commissioned by Duke of Berwick. He was also Duke of Liria.\nIn the early 19th century, it passed to the House of Alba. Eug\u00E9nie de Montijo, last empress consort of the French, died here in exile in 1920.\nAll but the facades were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. It was rebuilt by Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba and his daughter Cayetana. The British architect Edwin Lutyens provided some designs for the interior. The reconstruction used his plans, even though he died before then.\nAs of 2012, the owner of the palace was the 18th Duchess of Alba. She lived in Seville. The main resident of the palace was her son and heir Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 14th Duke of Hu\u00E9scar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":50},{"uri":"House_of_Alba","surface_form":"House of Alba","offset":93},{"uri":"James_Fitz-James_Stuart%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Berwick","surface_form":"Duke of Berwick","offset":139},{"uri":"Liria","surface_form":"Liria","offset":176},{"uri":"House_of_Alba","surface_form":"House of Alba","offset":227},{"uri":"Eug%C3%A9nie_de_Montijo","surface_form":"Eug\u00E9nie de Montijo","offset":242},{"uri":"Facade","surface_form":"facade","offset":338},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":372},{"uri":"Jacobo_Fitz-James_Stuart%2C_17th_Duke_of_Alba","surface_form":"Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba","offset":409},{"uri":"Cayetana_Fitz-James_Stuart%2C_18th_Duchess_of_Alba","surface_form":"Cayetana","offset":470},{"uri":"Edwin_Lutyens","surface_form":"Edwin Lutyens","offset":502},{"uri":"Carlos_Fitz-James_Stuart%2C_14th_Duke_of_Hu%C3%A9scar","surface_form":"Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 14th Duke of Hu\u00E9scar","offset":765}]}
