He suspended his campaign and withdrew from the election on October 20, 2015.\nEarly life.\nWebb was born in St. Joseph, Missouri. His father, James Henry Webb, served in the United States Air Force. His mother, Vera Lorraine Hodges, was a housewife. His family descended from Irish-Scots immigrants. Webb went to many schools in the U.S. and in England.

He was gravely concerned with the disarray the Marines had fallen into post-Vietnam: drug use, racial infighting, and low morale within the Corps left him with the impression it was no longer America's premier fighting force.\nUnited States Secretary of the Navy (1987-1988).\nIn 1987, he served as Secretary of the Navy, becoming the first Naval Academy graduate to serve as the civilian head of the Navy. As Navy Secretary, Webb pushed the appointment of Alfred M.

Webb had wished to increase the Navy to 600 ships. As revealed in \"The Reagan Diaries\", President Ronald Reagan wrote on February 22, 1988: \"I don't think Navy was sorry to see him go.\"\nAfter his resignation, Webb earned his living primarily as an author and filmmaker.

John Warner, R-Va., a fellow former Secretary of the Navy; and former Virginia Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb, who held the same seat before losing to Allen.\nOn November 15, 2006, Senate majority-leader-in-waiting Harry Reid assigned Webb to three committees: the committees on Foreign Relations, Veterans' Affairs, and Armed Services.\nOn January 23, 2007, Webb delivered the Democratic response to the President's State of the Union address, focusing on the economy and Iraq. Webb's speech drew positive reviews, and was regarded as one of the stronger State of the Union responses in recent memory. Webb, a decorated war veteran, spoke of his family\u2019s military past, his own passionate attachment to the military, and the way in which previous presidents had always attempted to ensure that all precautions had been taken when sending young Americans into harm's way.\nOn August 14, 2009 Webb visited Myanmar (Burma), seeing its junta's leader, Gen.
