{"id":470531,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badger","text":"Badgers are short-legged mammals found across Europe, Africa, North America and Asia.\nPhysical description.\nBadgers have wide bodies, with short legs for digging. They have long weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species. They have black faces with white markings and grey bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail. They have dark legs with light coloured underbellies. They grow to around in length including the tail. The European badger is one of the largest badgers. The American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are a little smaller and lighter. They weigh around 9.1\u201311 kg (20\u201324 lb) on average, with some badgers in Europe and Asia weighing about 18 kg (40 lb)\nA male badger is called a boar. A female is called a sow. A young badger is called a cub.\nDistribution.\nBadgers are found in North America, Ireland, Britain and most of Europe. The Javan ferret-badger lives in Indonesia. The Bornean ferret-badger lives in Malaysia. The honey badger is found in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Desert, southern Levant, Turkmenistan, and India.\nBehavior.\nBadgers all live underground. They live in burrows called setts, which may be very large. Some live on their own, moving from home to home. Others are known to form family groups called \"cetes\". Between two and fifteen badgers can live in a cete at one time. Badgers can run or gallop at speeds of up to 25\u201330 km/h (16\u201319 mph) for short periods of time. Badgers are only active at night. They can dig a hole fast enough to escape most predators. They fill in the hole behind them as they dig.\nFood.\nThe badger\u2019s diet is mainly small mammals; mice, gophers and squirrels. They eat amphibians, reptiles and birds. Badgers also eat earthworms, insects, grubs, and bird eggs. They will sometimes eat roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the main predator of hedgehogs. Badgers have been known to become drunk from the alcohol found in rotting fruit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammals","offset":25},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":46},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":54},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":62},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":80},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"bodies","offset":126},{"uri":"Leg","surface_form":"leg","offset":145},{"uri":"Dig","surface_form":"dig","offset":154},{"uri":"Weasel","surface_form":"weasel-like","offset":178},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":190},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"ear","offset":207},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":219},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":253},{"uri":"Face","surface_form":"face","offset":278},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":289},{"uri":"Marking","surface_form":"marking","offset":295},{"uri":"Stripe","surface_form":"stripe","offset":342},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"underbellies","offset":408},{"uri":"European_badger","surface_form":"European badger","offset":476},{"uri":"American_badger","surface_form":"American badger","offset":527},{"uri":"Hog_badger","surface_form":"hog badger","offset":548},{"uri":"Honey_badger","surface_form":"honey badger","offset":567},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":856},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":871},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":880},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":941},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":987},{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"sub-Saharan Africa","offset":1026},{"uri":"Arabian_Desert","surface_form":"Arabian Desert","offset":1050},{"uri":"Levant","surface_form":"Levant","offset":1075},{"uri":"Turkmenistan","surface_form":"Turkmenistan","offset":1083},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1101},{"uri":"Underground","surface_form":"underground","offset":1135},{"uri":"Burrow","surface_form":"burrow","offset":1161},{"uri":"Family","surface_form":"family","offset":1283},{"uri":"Nocturnal_animals","surface_form":"active at night","offset":1489},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":1553},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":1630},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":1660},{"uri":"Pocket_gopher","surface_form":"gophers","offset":1666},{"uri":"Squirrels","surface_form":"squirrels","offset":1678},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":1698},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":1710},{"uri":"Earthworm","surface_form":"earthworms","offset":1747},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insects","offset":1759},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1779},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":1784},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":1834},{"uri":"Hedgehog","surface_form":"hedgehogs","offset":1873},{"uri":"Drunk","surface_form":"drunk","offset":1918},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":1933},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1958}]}
