He wrote under the pseudonym S.U. Zanne. Vandekerkhove started a movement he called Cosmosofie (Cosmosophy). He said that Cosmosophy was the opposite of Theosophy. When he was young he wrote a novel and three plays. His literary work was inspired by ethics and psychology. Later he moved to Scotland, the USA and France.\nIn France he wrote works on kabala, esotericism and the occult. He was one of the first writers talking about subjects like feminism and the Age of Aquarius. Each year on Palm Sunday at 5 PM, at the cemetery of Flac\u00E9 in M\u00E2con in France, people come together to remember him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kanegem","surface_form":"Kanegem","offset":38},{"uri":"M%C3%A2con","surface_form":"M\u00E2con","offset":62},{"uri":"Belgians","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":75},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":83},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":91},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":103},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":109},{"uri":"Inventor","surface_form":"inventor","offset":121},{"uri":"Pseudonym","surface_form":"pseudonym","offset":150},{"uri":"Social_movement","surface_form":"movement","offset":196},{"uri":"Theosophy","surface_form":"Theosophy","offset":284},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":324},{"uri":"Play","surface_form":"play","offset":340},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethics","offset":381},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":392},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":422},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":436},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":444},{"uri":"Kabala","surface_form":"kabala","offset":480},{"uri":"Esotericism","surface_form":"esotericism","offset":488},{"uri":"Occult","surface_form":"occult","offset":508},{"uri":"Feminism","surface_form":"feminism","offset":576},{"uri":"Aquarius","surface_form":"Aquarius","offset":600},{"uri":"Palm_Sunday","surface_form":"Palm Sunday","offset":623},{"uri":"M%C3%A2con","surface_form":"M\u00E2con","offset":672}]}
