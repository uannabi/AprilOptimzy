{"id":470836,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n","text":"Gij\u00F3n is a city in the autonomous community of Asturias in Spain. It is located on the Bay of Biscay, about north of Oviedo. Gij\u00F3n has a population of 275,274 inhabitants, more than any other city in Asturias.\nHistory.\nFor most of its history Gij\u00F3n was just a small town and seaport. After the conquest of the Asturias in the 3rd century BC by the Romans they called the site \"Gigia\". in 714 a garrison was established by the Moors. From here they attacked the Asturias but failed in the attempt. After the Moors left, Gij\u00F3n was ruled by Asturian kings. In the 10th century the Asturias became part of the Kingdom of Le\u00F3n. In the 16th century the harbor was improved under Philip II of Spain. Some of the ships of the Spanish Armada took shelter at Gij\u00F3n's port in a violent storm. They were on their way to attack Britain in 1588. After the epic battle, a few of the remaining ships limped back to Gij\u00F3n. During the last half of the 19th century a railroad was built to Gij\u00F3n to ship Asturian coal to other parts of Spain. This was the start of Gij\u00F3n becoming a large industrial center. During the Spanish Civil War part of Gij\u00F3n was destroyed.\nModern Gij\u00F3n.\nGij\u00F3n is famous for its beaches. In the summer newer parts of town resemble a carnival much like Coney Island. Every November the Gij\u00F3n International Film Festival is held. The main stage is the Jovellanos Theatre, although other cinemas and cultural centres are also used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Autonomous_communities_of_Spain","surface_form":"autonomous community","offset":23},{"uri":"Asturias","surface_form":"Asturias","offset":47},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":59},{"uri":"Bay_of_Biscay","surface_form":"Bay of Biscay","offset":87},{"uri":"Oviedo","surface_form":"Oviedo","offset":117},{"uri":"Inhabitant","surface_form":"inhabitant","offset":159},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":235},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":266},{"uri":"Seaport","surface_form":"seaport","offset":275},{"uri":"Conquest","surface_form":"conquest","offset":294},{"uri":"3rd_century","surface_form":"3rd century","offset":326},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":338},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":348},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":371},{"uri":"Garrison","surface_form":"garrison","offset":394},{"uri":"Moors","surface_form":"Moors","offset":426},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":448},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":547},{"uri":"10th_century","surface_form":"10th century","offset":561},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Kingdom of Le\u00F3n","offset":606},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":630},{"uri":"Philip_II_of_Spain","surface_form":"Philip II of Spain","offset":673},{"uri":"Spanish_Armada","surface_form":"Spanish Armada","offset":718},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":815},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":934},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":949},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":994},{"uri":"Industrial","surface_form":"industrial","offset":1069},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":1099},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":1184},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":1200},{"uri":"Carnival","surface_form":"carnival","offset":1238},{"uri":"Coney_Island","surface_form":"Coney Island","offset":1257},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"International","offset":1296},{"uri":"Film_festival","surface_form":"Film Festival","offset":1310},{"uri":"Stage_(theatre)","surface_form":"stage","offset":1342},{"uri":"Cinema","surface_form":"cinema","offset":1390},{"uri":"Cultural_centre","surface_form":"cultural centre","offset":1402}]}
