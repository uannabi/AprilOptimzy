Many flatbreads are made without yeast: they are unleavened bread. Some have a very little yeast, such as pita bread and naans.\nThere are many other ingredients that flatbreads may have. Curry powder, diced jalape\u00F1os, chili powder, black pepper, olive oil and sesame oil may be added. Flatbreads can range from one millimeter to a few centimeters thick.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":17},{"uri":"Flour","surface_form":"flour","offset":33},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":40},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":51},{"uri":"Dough","surface_form":"dough","offset":101},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":141},{"uri":"Unleavened_bread","surface_form":"unleavened bread","offset":157},{"uri":"Pita_bread","surface_form":"pita bread","offset":214},{"uri":"Naan","surface_form":"naan","offset":229},{"uri":"Jalape%C3%B1o","surface_form":"jalape\u00F1o","offset":315},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"olive oil","offset":354},{"uri":"Sesame_oil","surface_form":"sesame oil","offset":368},{"uri":"Millimeter","surface_form":"millimeter","offset":423},{"uri":"Centimeter","surface_form":"centimeter","offset":443}]}
