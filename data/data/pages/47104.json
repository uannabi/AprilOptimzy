{"id":47104,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire","text":"Yorkshire is a historic county in Northern England. It covers a large area of the Pennines and its east coast borders the North Sea. The River Humber separates Yorkshire from Lincolnshire and the River Ouse flows into it.\nThe main towns and cities in Yorkshire are Leeds, York, Sheffield, Bradford, Middlesbrough, and Hull. It is the largest county in the United Kingdom. It covers just under with a population of around 5 million.\nYorkshire was historically split up into three parts known as the East, North, and West Ridings while the county town York was in the middle. In the local government reorganization of England in 1974 the counties of West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire were established instead. Humberside included the former East Riding and Cleveland included part of the former North Riding.\nThe people of Yorkshire are traditional rivals of the people of Lancashire; they sometimes call Yorkshire the \"County of Broad Acres\" (because its land area is so large) or \"God's Own County\".\nIt has a wide range of landscapes: the green hills and valleys of the Yorkshire dales, the rugged heather of the Yorkshire moors, the coast which includes the resorts of Whitby or Bridlington. It also has several large cities including York (county town), Leeds, Sheffield (the greenest city in Europe and built on seven hills), Hull, Bradford, Doncaster, Harrogate and Wakefield.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":24},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":43},{"uri":"Pennines","surface_form":"Pennines","offset":82},{"uri":"River_Humber","surface_form":"River Humber","offset":137},{"uri":"Lincolnshire","surface_form":"Lincolnshire","offset":175},{"uri":"River_Ouse%2C_Yorkshire","surface_form":"River Ouse","offset":196},{"uri":"Leeds","surface_form":"Leeds","offset":265},{"uri":"York","surface_form":"York","offset":272},{"uri":"Sheffield","surface_form":"Sheffield","offset":278},{"uri":"Bradford","surface_form":"Bradford","offset":289},{"uri":"Middlesbrough","surface_form":"Middlesbrough","offset":299},{"uri":"Kingston_upon_Hull","surface_form":"Hull","offset":318},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":356},{"uri":"Riding_(division)","surface_form":"Ridings","offset":520},{"uri":"York","surface_form":"York","offset":550},{"uri":"West_Yorkshire","surface_form":"West Yorkshire","offset":648},{"uri":"North_Yorkshire","surface_form":"North Yorkshire","offset":664},{"uri":"South_Yorkshire","surface_form":"South Yorkshire","offset":681},{"uri":"Humberside","surface_form":"Humberside","offset":723},{"uri":"Cleveland","surface_form":"Cleveland","offset":770},{"uri":"Lancashire","surface_form":"Lancashire","offset":886}]}
