{"id":47112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupua%C3%A7u","text":"Cupua\u00E7u (\"Theobroma grandiflorum\"), also spelled Cupuassu and Copoasu, is a tropical rainforest tree related to Cacao. Common throughout the Amazon basin, it is widely cultivated in the north of Brazil. The largest production occurs in Par\u00E1, followed by Amazonas, Rond\u00F4nia and Acre.\nCupua\u00E7u trees usually are between 5 and 15 meters (16 to 50 feet) tall. Some trees can reach 20 meters (65\u00A0feet). They have brown bark. Their leaves are 25\u201335\u00A0cm (10\u201314\u00A0in) long and 6\u201310\u00A0cm (2\u20134\u00A0in) across. These leaves have 9 or 10 pairs of veins. As they mature, their leaves change colour from pink-tinted to green. Eventually they begin bearing fruit. Cupua\u00E7u fruits are oblong, brown, and fuzzy, 20\u00A0cm (8\u00A0in) long, 1\u20132\u00A0kg (2\u20134\u00A0lb) in weight, and covered with a thick (4\u20137\u00A0mm), hard exocarp.\nThe white pulp of the cupua\u00E7u is uniquely fragrant. It contains theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid) instead of the xanthines (caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline) found in cacao. Cupua\u00E7u can replace cocoa in many day-to-day foods, especially for children, such as chocolate milk. It is frequently used in desserts, juices and sweets. Cupua\u00E7u seeds can be made into cupulate, which looks and tastes just like chocolate but is cheaper and more resistant to heat. Asahi Foods, a Japanese company, once tried to patent the production and use of Cupua\u00E7u seed fat, but they failed.\nThe wood is also commonly used for timber.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":96},{"uri":"Cacao","surface_form":"Cacao","offset":112},{"uri":"Amazon_basin","surface_form":"Amazon basin","offset":141},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":195},{"uri":"Par%C3%A1","surface_form":"Par\u00E1","offset":236},{"uri":"Amazonas_(Brazil)","surface_form":"Amazonas","offset":254},{"uri":"Rond%C3%B4nia","surface_form":"Rond\u00F4nia","offset":264},{"uri":"Acre_(state)","surface_form":"Acre","offset":277},{"uri":"Bark","surface_form":"bark","offset":413},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":425},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":632},{"uri":"Oblong","surface_form":"oblong","offset":658},{"uri":"Exocarp","surface_form":"exocarp","offset":770},{"uri":"Pulp_(fruit)","surface_form":"pulp","offset":789},{"uri":"Fragrance","surface_form":"fragrant","offset":821},{"uri":"Theacrine","surface_form":"theacrine","offset":843},{"uri":"Xanthine","surface_form":"xanthine","offset":899},{"uri":"Caffeine","surface_form":"caffeine","offset":910},{"uri":"Theobromine","surface_form":"theobromine","offset":920},{"uri":"Theophylline","surface_form":"theophylline","offset":937},{"uri":"Cupulate","surface_form":"cupulate","offset":1153},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":1196},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":1296},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":1368},{"uri":"Timber","surface_form":"timber","offset":1399}]}
