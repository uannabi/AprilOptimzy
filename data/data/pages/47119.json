{"id":47119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search","text":"e=\"preserve\">Linear search or sequential search is a method to find an item in a list. It is a search algorithm.\nAlgorithm.\nStart out with a list, codice_2 which may have the item that we want to look for.\nImplementation.\nIn the Java programming language, linear search looks like this. This method has two parameters: an array of integers and the item we are looking for (also an integer). It says the location in the array if it finds the item. If it does not find it, it says -1.\npublic int linearSearch(int[] list, int item)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List","surface_form":"list","offset":81},{"uri":"Search_algorithm","surface_form":"search algorithm","offset":95},{"uri":"Java_programming_language","surface_form":"Java","offset":229},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":234},{"uri":"Method_(computer_science)","surface_form":"method","offset":292},{"uri":"Parameter","surface_form":"parameter","offset":307},{"uri":"Array","surface_form":"array","offset":322},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":331}]}
