{"id":4712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwear","text":"Footwear is an item of clothing made by humans that covers and protects the foot, including the soles of the feet. Footwear allows people to walk on rough surfaces such as gravel roads without hurting their feet. Some types of footwear such as boots help to keep people's feet dry, or help to keep people's feet warm in cold weather.\nBy hand.\nPeople in many countries make their own footwear by hand, using simple tools. A simple pair of sandals can be made by hand cutting a foot-shaped sole out of a thick, flexible material such as rubber. Next, straps of fabric, rope or leather can be added with a needle and thread. A simple pair of boots can be made by hand by using animal hide with fur, and sewing it with strong thread.\nIn a factory.\nMany people wear footwear that is made in a factory. The machines in shoe factories and boot factories can make footwear much more quickly than people who are making footwear by hand with a needle and thread.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":23},{"uri":"Foot","surface_form":"foot","offset":76},{"uri":"Sole","surface_form":"sole","offset":96},{"uri":"Gravel","surface_form":"gravel","offset":172},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":179},{"uri":"Boot","surface_form":"boot","offset":244},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"cold","offset":320},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":414},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"cutting","offset":466},{"uri":"Needle","surface_form":"needle","offset":603},{"uri":"Thread","surface_form":"thread","offset":614},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":788}]}
