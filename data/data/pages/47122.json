{"id":47122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure","text":"e=\"preserve\">In programming languages, an array is a way of storing several items (such as integers).\nThese items must have the same type (only integers, only strings,\u00A0\u2026) because an array can not store different kinds of items.\nEvery item in an array has a number so the programmer can get the item by using that number.\nThis number is called the \"index\".\nIn some programming languages, the first item has index\u00A00, the second item has index\u00A01 and so on.\nBut in other languages, the first item has index 1 (and then 2, 3,\u00A0\u2026).\nWhen the programmer creates an array, they must give the size of the array.\nThis is the number of items that can be stored in the array.\nIf the programmer wants to store more items, then they must create a new array.\nThis is because the size of an array can not be changed.\nTypes of arrays in C is [https://studypointbihar.blogspot.com/2020/02/array.html?m=1 here]\nArrays in C.\nThis creates an array of integers and it can store 5 integers.\nint k = 3 + array[3]; // k is now 3 + 33 = 36\nArrays in Java.\nThis creates an array of integers and it can store 5 integers.\nint k = 3 + array[3]; // k is now 3 + 33 = 36","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":16},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":91},{"uri":"String","surface_form":"string","offset":159},{"uri":"Programmer","surface_form":"programmer","offset":271},{"uri":"Size","surface_form":"size","offset":582}]}
