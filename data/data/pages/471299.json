Using a variety of methods, botanists study how plants reproduce, grow, get nutrients, photosynthesise, get water, and so on.\nThe main topics of plant physiology are photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, plant hormones, tropisms, nastic movements, photoperiodism, photomorphogenesis, circadian rhythms, environmental stress physiology, seed germination, dormancy, stomata function and transpiration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":32},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiology","offset":82},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":96},{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproduce","offset":159},{"uri":"Grow","surface_form":"grow","offset":170},{"uri":"Nutrients","surface_form":"nutrients","offset":180},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesise","offset":191},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":270},{"uri":"Cellular_respiration","surface_form":"respiration","offset":286},{"uri":"Plant_nutrition","surface_form":"plant nutrition","offset":299},{"uri":"Plant_hormone","surface_form":"plant hormone","offset":316},{"uri":"Tropism","surface_form":"tropism","offset":332},{"uri":"Nastic_movement","surface_form":"nastic movement","offset":342},{"uri":"Photoperiodism","surface_form":"photoperiodism","offset":360},{"uri":"Photomorphogenesis","surface_form":"photomorphogenesis","offset":376},{"uri":"Circadian_rhythm","surface_form":"circadian rhythm","offset":396},{"uri":"Germination","surface_form":"germination","offset":453},{"uri":"Dormancy","surface_form":"dormancy","offset":466},{"uri":"Stoma","surface_form":"stoma","offset":476},{"uri":"Transpiration","surface_form":"transpiration","offset":497}]}
