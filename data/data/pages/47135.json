It was in Bath, England. They made one game: \"Warzone 2100\". It was a real-time strategy game for PC and PlayStation. It used a few new ideas such as machines that use radio waves to find other objects (radar technology) and machines that shoot objects (artillery). The game also used movies to tell the story to the player. These movies are called full motion videos.\nThe company was closed on 13 March 2000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":35},{"uri":"Computer_game","surface_form":"computer","offset":53},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":66},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":97},{"uri":"Bath%2C_England","surface_form":"Bath, England","offset":113},{"uri":"Warzone_2100","surface_form":"Warzone 2100","offset":149},{"uri":"Real-time_strategy","surface_form":"real-time strategy","offset":173},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"PC","offset":201},{"uri":"PlayStation","surface_form":"PlayStation","offset":208},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":253},{"uri":"Radio_wave","surface_form":"radio wave","offset":271},{"uri":"Radar","surface_form":"radar","offset":306},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":312},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":357},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":388},{"uri":"Full_motion_video","surface_form":"full motion videos","offset":452},{"uri":"13_March","surface_form":"13 March","offset":498},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":507}]}
