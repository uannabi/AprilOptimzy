This breed is adapted to a very cold climate. It has a double coat. The top coat is glossy, long, water-shedding hairs. It also has a woolly undercoat for insulation. The breed's ancestors may have been brought to Norway by the Vikings.\nHistory.\nDuring World War II, the breed became nearly extinct. A Norwegian cat club helped the breed. They created an official breeding program. It was registered as a breed with the European F\u00E9d\u00E9ration Internationale F\u00E9line in the 1970s. This was when a local cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed. He made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cat_breeds","surface_form":"breed","offset":37},{"uri":"Domestic","surface_form":"domestic","offset":46},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":55},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"North","offset":68},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":77},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":90},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":122},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":219},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"undercoat","offset":226},{"uri":"Thermal_insulation","surface_form":"insulation","offset":240},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":264},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":299},{"uri":"Viking","surface_form":"Viking","offset":313},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":338},{"uri":"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_F%C3%A9line","surface_form":"F\u00E9d\u00E9ration Internationale F\u00E9line","offset":514},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":741},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":749},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":761}]}
