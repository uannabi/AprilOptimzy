{"id":471446,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojihwayangdong_buralsongseonsaeng","text":"\"Bojihwayangdong buralsongseonsaeng\" () is a bilingual pun in Classical Chinese and Korean. It is part of the literature of the Joseon period of Korea. It has historically been used as a source of humour in Korean.\nWhen Heo Mok was ordered to attend the academy of the more senior scholar Song Siyeol at Hwayang-dong, he made the journey. Once he got there, he was forced to wait for a long time. Then he found out the appointment had been cancelled. Heo Mok angrily stated \"bojihwayangdong buralsongseonsaeng\". In Classical Chinese, the statement means \"Walked to Hwayang-dong; did not see teacher Song\", but in native Korean, \"boji\" () refers to \"female genitals\", while \"bural\" () means \"testicles\", making the expression additionally mean \"cunt Hwayang-dong; testicles teacher Song\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Korean name"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classical_Chinese","surface_form":"Classical Chinese","offset":62},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":84},{"uri":"Joseon","surface_form":"Joseon period","offset":128},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":145},{"uri":"Heo_Mok","surface_form":"Heo Mok","offset":220},{"uri":"Song_Siyeol","surface_form":"Song Siyeol","offset":289},{"uri":"Hwayang-dong","surface_form":"Hwayang-dong","offset":304}]}
