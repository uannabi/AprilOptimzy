{"id":47145,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_chip","text":"Chocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate. They are used to make desserts, usually in baking. Chocolate chips are most common in cookies. Chocolate chips are also used in some cakes and other desserts.\nOrigin.\nChocolate chips were invented in 1937 when Ruth Graves Wakefield of the Toll House Inn added cut-up chunks of a semi-sweet Nestl\u00E9 chocolate bar to a cookie recipe. Lots of people liked the new cookies, and Wakefield made an agreement in 1939 with Nestl\u00E9 to put her recipe on the chocolate bar's packaging. In return, Nestl\u00E9 gave Wakefield a lifetime supply of chocolate.\nAt first, Nestl\u00E9 put a small chopping tool in the chocolate bar package. In 1941 Nestl\u00E9 and one or more other chocolate bar companies started selling the chocolate in chip (or \"morsel\") form. The Nestl\u00E9 brand Toll House cookies is named after Toll House Inn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":36},{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":69},{"uri":"Baking","surface_form":"baking","offset":90},{"uri":"Cookie","surface_form":"cookie","offset":133},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":180},{"uri":"Nestl%C3%A9","surface_form":"Nestl\u00E9","offset":595}]}
