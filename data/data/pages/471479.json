{"id":471479,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bridge_Federation","text":"e=\"preserve\">The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the international body for contract bridge. The WBF is responsible for world championship competition, most of which is on a four-year cycle. The top championships are those for national teams in Open, Women, and Seniors categories. There is a World Team Olympiad every four years.\nThe World Bridge Federation was founded August 1958 by delegates from Europe, North America, and South America (now Zones 1 to 3). Each national organisation is in one of the eight geographic zones.\nIt is incorporated under the laws of Switzerland as a 'non-profit' organization. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt was made the first honorary member of the WBF for his work developing the game.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Contract_bridge","surface_form":"contract bridge","offset":77},{"uri":"Olympiad","surface_form":"Olympiad","offset":305},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":568},{"uri":"Non-profit","surface_form":"non-profit","offset":586},{"uri":"Harold_Stirling_Vanderbilt","surface_form":"Harold Stirling Vanderbilt","offset":612}]}
