{"id":471530,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_teal","text":"The Eurasian teal, common teal, or Eurasian green-winged teal (\"Anas crecca\") is a duck that lives in Europe and Asia. It is the only kind of teal in most places. Teal is also the name of a color between blue and green. The bird has this color round its eyes.\nThe teal mates where the weather is temperate, but in winter it flies south to avoid the cold. When it is not starting a family, the teal likes to be with other teals. It often lives in places where the ground is very wet and the wind is usually not strong. It does not go under the water to find its food. Instead, it stays on top of the water and eats seeds and bugs that live in the water.\nSome scientists think that another kind of teal, the North American green-winged teal (\"A. carolinensis\"), is a kind of common teal","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":83},{"uri":"Teal_(color)","surface_form":"Teal","offset":163},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":296}]}
