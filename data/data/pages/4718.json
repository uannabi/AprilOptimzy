{"id":4718,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_salt","text":"Table salt is a mineral composed mainly of sodium chloride (NaCl). This is a chemical compound, one of many salts. Salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite.\nWhen salt (sodium chloride) is mixed with water, the salt dissolves into the water, creating a saline solution. Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about of solids per litre, a salinity of 3.5%.\nSalt can be made by either evaporation or can be mined. To get sea salt, man-made holes are built then filled with sea water. The water evaporates and leaves salt behind.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":16},{"uri":"Sodium_chloride","surface_form":"sodium chloride","offset":43},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":77},{"uri":"Salt_(chemistry)","surface_form":"salts","offset":108},{"uri":"Crystallinity","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":145},{"uri":"Halite","surface_form":"halite","offset":190},{"uri":"Seawater","surface_form":"seawater","offset":348},{"uri":"Salinity","surface_form":"salinity","offset":448},{"uri":"Evaporation","surface_form":"evaporation","offset":493},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mined","offset":515},{"uri":"Sea_water","surface_form":"sea water","offset":581}]}
