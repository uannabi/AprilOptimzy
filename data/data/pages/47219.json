Dasmann in 1968, where he advocated conservation. It was widely adopted only in the 1980s.\nThe term biodiversity first appeared in a publication in 1988 when entomologist E. O. Wilson used it as a title. Since then, the term has often been used by biologists, environmentalists, political leaders, and citizens. A similar term in the United States is \"natural heritage.\" It predates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conservation","surface_form":"conservation","offset":144},{"uri":"E._O._Wilson","surface_form":"E.
