{"id":472225,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Molossia","text":"Molossia, also known as the self-proclaimed Republic of Molossia, is a micronation, founded by Kevin Baugh and headquartered in his home near Dayton, Nevada. Baugh has also been the president since 3 September 1999.\nBefore holding this office Baugh was prime minister of Vuldstein, Edelstein, and Zaria from 1977 to 1999. He changed Molossia from a monarchy to a republic.\nMolossia is made up of Baugh's house (known as the Government House), about in size, as well as of surrounding property, enclaved by Nevada. It formerly claimed a property in Pennsylvania as well. According to author John Ryan, Molossia is \"a hobby that has been pushed to the nth degree.\" Originally established as a childhood project in 1977, Molossia subsequently evolved into a territorial entity in the late 1990s.\nThe name \"Molossia\" is derived from the Spanish word \"morro\" which means \"small rocky hill\". Baugh has stated that the ancient Greek tribe of Molossians is unrelated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Micronation","surface_form":"micronation","offset":71},{"uri":"Dayton%2C_Nevada","surface_form":"Dayton, Nevada","offset":142},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":506},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":548},{"uri":"Territorial_entity","surface_form":"territorial entity","offset":755},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":833},{"uri":"Molossians","surface_form":"Molossians","offset":935}]}
