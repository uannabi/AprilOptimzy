Declared in 2004 in response to the Australian government's refusal to recognise same-sex marriages. It is near the islets on the Great Barrier Reef. It is an expression of queer nationalism.\nAs of 17 November 2017, the Kingdom was dissolved, per the decision made by the Australian people to legalize gay marriage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Micronation","surface_form":"micronation","offset":59},{"uri":"Gay_rights","surface_form":"gay rights","offset":125},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":165},{"uri":"Same-sex_marriage","surface_form":"same-sex marriage","offset":269},{"uri":"Great_Barrier_Reef","surface_form":"Great Barrier Reef","offset":318},{"uri":"Queer_nationalism","surface_form":"queer nationalism","offset":361}]}
