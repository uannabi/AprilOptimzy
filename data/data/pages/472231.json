On 19 February 1913, General Victoriano Huerta overthrew President Madero.

He claimed that his life was in danger if he refused.\nUnder the Constitution of Mexico, the vice-president, the attorney general, the foreign minister and then the interior minister stood next in line to the presidency.

Lascur\u00E1in was president for less than an hour; sources quote figures ranging from 15 to 56 minutes.
