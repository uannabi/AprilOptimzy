{"id":472246,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework","text":"e=\"preserve\">.NET Framework (pronounced dot net) is a product of Microsoft. It is a programming framework used by Software applications in order to run. It has two major parts: the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the.Net Framework Class Library. The CLR is an execution engine used to handle running programs. The class library provides a library of reusable code that applications can use. These are designed to greatly simplify the development of larger applications..Net Framework supports Object-oriented programming (OOP). Everything in.Net is contained in an object. It also greatly simplifies Windows programming.\nOften, a program will ask for a particular version of.Net Framework to be installed (see below). It is usually recommended to install the latest version your operating system (OS) will support. This is because of backward compatibility; the newer version will also support older versions.\nVisual Studio is the major development tool for.net Framework. Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition is the first full-featured edition for personal development. It also has compilers for computer programming languages such as C++ and others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":65},{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"programming","offset":84},{"uri":"Framework","surface_form":"framework","offset":96},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"Software applications","offset":114},{"uri":"Execution_(computing)","surface_form":"run","offset":148},{"uri":"Common_Language_Runtime","surface_form":"Common Language Runtime","offset":181},{"uri":"Class_Library","surface_form":"Class Library","offset":233},{"uri":"Software_engine","surface_form":"execution engine","offset":262},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"programs","offset":302},{"uri":"Source_code","surface_form":"code","offset":361},{"uri":"Object-oriented_programming","surface_form":"Object-oriented programming","offset":495},{"uri":"Object_(computer_science)","surface_form":"object","offset":567},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":602},{"uri":"Software_versioning","surface_form":"version","offset":666},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":781},{"uri":"Backward_compatibility","surface_form":"backward compatibility","offset":836},{"uri":"Visual_Studio_Tools_for_Applications","surface_form":"Visual Studio","offset":912},{"uri":"Software_Development_Kit","surface_form":"development tool","offset":939},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":1099},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":1108},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":1138}]}
