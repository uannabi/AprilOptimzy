He was recruited out of an Iron Maiden cover band. In late 1985, Crover formed the band Fecal Matter with Kurt Cobain and Greg Hokanson. Hokanson would later leave the band. After he left, Cobain and Crover decided to record \"Illiteracy Will Prevail\" on a 4-track in December 1985 at Cobain's aunt's home in Seattle, Washington. The band would break up in 1986.\nCrover would end up drumming on Nirvana's ten-song demo that was recorded on January 23, 1988 at Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle. He played a 14-song show with Nirvana in Tacoma, Washington, the night of the demo session. Three of the cuts from the show \"Downer\", \"Floyd the Barber\" and \"Raunchola/Moby Dick\" would appear on the 2004 box set, \"With the Lights Out\".
