The word comes from the Latin \"jus, juris\" meaning \"law\" and \"dicere\" meaning \"to speak\": and literally means: telling the law. Jurisdiction may be legally restricted to a certain period of time called a statute of limitations.\nIt also includes the authority a of formally constituted legal body or a political leader to deal with legal matters and, by implication, to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility. Jurisdiction relies on public International Law, conflict of laws, constitutional law and the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government to give resources to best serve the needs of its society.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":16},{"uri":"Authority","surface_form":"authority","offset":41},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":62},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":141},{"uri":"Statute_of_limitations","surface_form":"statute of limitations","offset":321},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":402},{"uri":"Political_leader","surface_form":"political leader","offset":418},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":497},{"uri":"Responsibility","surface_form":"responsibility","offset":530},{"uri":"Public_international_law","surface_form":"public International Law","offset":569},{"uri":"Conflict_of_Laws","surface_form":"conflict of laws","offset":595},{"uri":"Constitutional_law","surface_form":"constitutional law","offset":613},{"uri":"Executive_(government)","surface_form":"executive","offset":654},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislative","offset":668},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":692},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":752}]}
