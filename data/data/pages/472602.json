{"id":472602,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincial_city","text":"e=\"preserve\">Provincial cities (), sometimes translated provincial municipalities, are cities lesser in rank than special municipalities of the Republic of China (Taiwan). They are directly governed by provinces and are one level above the most basic county-controlled cities. In the early 20th century a provincial municipality was described as one having a population of over 200,000. However, if the city was important in politics, economics or culture it had to be over 100,000.\nAfter relocating the government to Taiwan the Republic of China government raised the limit to 500,000 in 1981. It was later raised again to 600,000. Currently, the \"Local Government Act\" of the Ministry of the Interior applies for the creation of a provincial city. In this case a city needs to have a population between 500,000 and 1,250,000. It must also have major political, economical and cultural roles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Special_municipality_(Taiwan)","surface_form":"special municipalities","offset":114},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Republic of China (Taiwan)","offset":144},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":202},{"uri":"County-controlled_cities","surface_form":"county-controlled cities","offset":251},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":290},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":425},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":435},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":448},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":504},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":518},{"uri":"Ministry_of_the_Interior_(Republic_of_China)","surface_form":"Ministry of the Interior","offset":678}]}
