{"id":4738,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay","text":"eBay is a website. It is a place for online auctions. Anybody can sell almost anything they want there. People can buy many things there as well.\nPeople have to send what they sell themselves, usually using mail. Some items may be collected by the buyer such as items to large or heavy to post. Buyers can transfer the money in any way they want as long as the sellers accept payments made that way. A lot of people use PayPal to transfer the money. PayPal is owned by the same people as eBay. Margaret Whitman was the CEO of eBay from 1998 to 2008.\nHistory.\neBay was started in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar. It was first called \"Auctionweb\". The name 'eBay' came later when he tried to register a domain name for his planned name \"EchoBay\". It was already taken so he shortened the name to 'eBay'.\nStatistics.\nMillions of items are bought on eBay every day. It is often very cheap to list an item on eBay. Total costs are usually below ordinary auction house costs. Many people look at others' items because they are interested in them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":10},{"uri":"Online","surface_form":"online","offset":37},{"uri":"Auction","surface_form":"auction","offset":44},{"uri":"Sales","surface_form":"sell","offset":66},{"uri":"Buy","surface_form":"buy","offset":115},{"uri":"Mail","surface_form":"mail","offset":207},{"uri":"Transfer","surface_form":"transfer","offset":306},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":319},{"uri":"PayPal","surface_form":"PayPal","offset":420},{"uri":"Own","surface_form":"owned","offset":460},{"uri":"Margaret_Whitman","surface_form":"Margaret Whitman","offset":494},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":579},{"uri":"Pierre_Omidyar","surface_form":"Pierre Omidyar","offset":587},{"uri":"Domain_name","surface_form":"domain name","offset":692}]}
