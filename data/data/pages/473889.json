{"id":473889,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Blood_Rising","text":"New Blood Rising was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). It was held on August 13, 2000 at Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, British Columbia. New Blood Rising replaced Road Wild as WCW's August pay-per-view. The pay-per-view's name is a reference to the New Blood stable in WCW.\nMatches.\n1\"Canadian Rules\" is that, instead of the traditional three-count, the referee has to use a five-count. After the five-count, the wrestler has to stay down for ten seconds. If both of the wrestlers are still down for a ten-count for any reason, the first man who gets to his feet wins the match. Also, there are no submissions and no count-outs.\n2After he was not at the pay-per-view because of a (kayfabe) mysterious motorcycle accident, Goldberg did not show up until the middle of the match. Then, in a worked shoot, Goldberg would walk out on the match, because he apparently refused to take Kevin Nash's Jacknife Powerbomb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":23},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":46},{"uri":"World_Championship_Wrestling","surface_form":"World Championship Wrestling","offset":72},{"uri":"Pacific_Coliseum","surface_form":"Pacific Coliseum","offset":142},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":162},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":173},{"uri":"Road_Wild","surface_form":"Road Wild","offset":217},{"uri":"The_New_Blood","surface_form":"New Blood","offset":303},{"uri":"Kayfabe","surface_form":"kayfabe","offset":735},{"uri":"Worked_shoot","surface_form":"worked shoot","offset":843}]}
