The speech was the third State of the Union address of President Reagan's second term.\nReagan said, \"The Soviet Union says it wants a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan, yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. We are ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal of all Soviet troops and genuine self-determination for the Afghan people.\" He ended with, \"But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun.\" Well, you can bet it's rising because, my fellow citizens, America isn't finished. Her best days have just begun.\"\nThe speech lasted 34 minutes and 39 seconds and had 3847 words. The address was broadcast live on radio and television.\nThe Democratic Party response was delivered by Senator Robert Byrd (WV), and House Speaker Jim Wright (TX)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"State_of_the_Union_address","surface_form":"State of the Union address","offset":9},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":49},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":59},{"uri":"Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress","surface_form":"joint session","offset":78},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"United States Congress","offset":105},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":254},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":306},{"uri":"Regime","surface_form":"regime","offset":364},{"uri":"Afghan_people","surface_form":"Afghan people","offset":546},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":908},{"uri":"Democratic_response_to_the_State_of_the_Union_address","surface_form":"response","offset":925},{"uri":"Robert_Byrd","surface_form":"Robert Byrd","offset":959},{"uri":"Jim_Wright","surface_form":"Jim Wright","offset":995}]}
