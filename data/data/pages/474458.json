{"id":474458,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_G6","text":"\"Like a G6\" is the first single off Asian-American hip hop group Far East Movement's third studio album \"Free Wired\". The song was released in April 13, 2010. The song features The Cataracs and American rapper Dev. The song chorus features a sample from Dev's song \"Booty Bounce\".\n\"Like a G6\" was able to stay as #1 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for two weeks which ended on November 6, 2010. The song was able to reach #1 again for the week of November 27 in the same year.\nThe \"G6\" in the song \"Booty Bounce\", which was sampled in \"Like a G6\", was put into the lyrics after the producers of the song were trying to look for a rhyme for the line \"Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6\", which is a reference to the 2000 song \"Sippin' on Some Syrup\" by American rap group Three 6 Mafia. The producers decided to choose \"G6\", which is meant to be a reference to the private airplane model Gulfstream IV, which is referred to as a \"G4\". According to Far East Movement member Kev Nish, they decided that a G6 was \"flyer than a G4\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Far_East_Movement","surface_form":"Far East Movement","offset":65},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":91},{"uri":"Free_Wired","surface_form":"Free Wired","offset":105},{"uri":"The_Cataracs","surface_form":"The Cataracs","offset":177},{"uri":"Dev_(singer)","surface_form":"Dev","offset":210},{"uri":"Booty_Bounce","surface_form":"Booty Bounce","offset":266},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":328},{"uri":"Sippin%27_on_Some_Syrup","surface_form":"Sippin' on Some Syrup","offset":732},{"uri":"Three_6_Mafia","surface_form":"Three 6 Mafia","offset":777},{"uri":"Gulfstream_IV","surface_form":"Gulfstream IV","offset":893}]}
