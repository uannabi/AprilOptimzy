{"id":474460,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woburn%2C_Bedfordshire","text":"Woburn is a village and civil parish in Bedfordshire, England. It is about five miles from Milton Keynes. At the 2011 census, 930 people lived in Woburn.\nThe first record of Woburn was in 969 AD as a hamlet. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086. The name Woburn comes from the Old English words 'wo', which means crooked, and 'burn' which means village. In 1145 Woburn Abbey was founded by Cistercian monks. In 1538, at the dissolution of the monasteries, the monastery was granted to the first Earl of Bedford. Woburn has been burned down and rebuilt three times in its history. The first time was due to a chimney fire that spread to the other houses. The second time was during the English Civil War. The third time was in 1724 when another fire destroyed most of the village. It was rebuilt the last time in the Georgian style. New inns and a Market-house were added.\nWoburn Abbey.\nRight in the centre of Woburn is a short road leading to Woburn Park, the large estate of the Duke of Bedford. The present Woburn Abbey is the family seat (country house) of the Russells, whose senior title is the Dukedom of Bedford. The estate includes the Woburn Safari Park, a sizeable herd of deer and ornamental gardens. The house is usually open to visitors, and includes one of the finest private collections of historical portraits and a superb library.\nThe house, estate and family were the subject of a reality series on BBC 2 running to 29 episodes. The house has been used a number of times as a film set.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":12},{"uri":"Civil_parish","surface_form":"civil parish","offset":24},{"uri":"Bedfordshire","surface_form":"Bedfordshire","offset":40},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":54},{"uri":"Milton_Keynes","surface_form":"Milton Keynes","offset":91},{"uri":"Hamlet","surface_form":"hamlet","offset":200},{"uri":"Domesday_Book","surface_form":"Domesday Book","offset":232},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":286},{"uri":"Woburn_Abbey","surface_form":"Woburn Abbey","offset":371},{"uri":"Cistercian","surface_form":"Cistercian monks","offset":399},{"uri":"Dissolution_of_the_monasteries","surface_form":"dissolution of the monasteries","offset":433},{"uri":"Earl_of_Bedford","surface_form":"Earl of Bedford","offset":504},{"uri":"Chimney","surface_form":"chimney","offset":617},{"uri":"English_Civil_War","surface_form":"English Civil War","offset":694},{"uri":"Georgian_architecture","surface_form":"Georgian style","offset":825},{"uri":"Inn","surface_form":"inn","offset":845},{"uri":"Market_hall","surface_form":"Market-house","offset":856},{"uri":"Duke_of_Bedford","surface_form":"Duke of Bedford","offset":989},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":1192},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portrait","offset":1325},{"uri":"Library","surface_form":"library","offset":1348},{"uri":"BBC_2","surface_form":"BBC 2","offset":1426}]}
