{"id":47451,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Harefoot","text":"Harold Harefoot, also Harold I'\", (\"c\". 1015 \u2013 17 March 1040) was King of England from 1035 to 1040. He was said to be the son of Canute the Great, King of England, Denmark, Norway, and some of Sweden, by his wife Aelgifu of Northampton. There was skepticism about his being Canute's son.\nUpon Canute's death (12 November 1035), Harold's younger half-brother Harthacanute, the son of Canute and his queen, Emma of Normandy, was legitimate heir to the thrones of both the Danes and the English. He was unable to travel to his coronation, because his Danish kingdom was under threat of invasion by King Magnus I of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden. Therefore, he was installed temporarily as regent though Godwin the Earl of Wessex and the Queen were against it.\nHarold died at Oxford on 17 March 17 1040, just as Harthacanute was preparing an invasion force of Danes, and was buried at the abbey of Westminster.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":74},{"uri":"Canute_the_Great","surface_form":"Canute the Great","offset":130},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":165},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":174},{"uri":"Aelgifu_of_Northampton","surface_form":"Aelgifu of Northampton","offset":214},{"uri":"Harthacanute","surface_form":"Harthacanute","offset":359},{"uri":"Emma_of_Normandy","surface_form":"Emma of Normandy","offset":406},{"uri":"Coronation","surface_form":"coronation","offset":525},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":584},{"uri":"King_of_Norway","surface_form":"King","offset":596},{"uri":"Magnus_I_of_Norway","surface_form":"Magnus I","offset":601},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":613},{"uri":"King_of_Sweden","surface_form":"King","offset":624},{"uri":"Anund_Jacob_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Anund Jacob of Sweden","offset":629},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":695},{"uri":"Godwin_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Godwin","offset":709},{"uri":"Earl_of_Wessex","surface_form":"Earl of Wessex","offset":720},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":781},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"abbey of Westminster","offset":894}]}
