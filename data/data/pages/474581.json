They are usually located in rural Sweden. They were often built during the late 18th century and the early 19th century. They were built when Esaias Tegn\u00E9r was bishop of the Diocese of V\u00E4xj\u00F6 in the Church of Sweden.\nThese buildings are usually white. They are built in Neoclassicist style. They have a tall tower connected to the main building. Many of the buildings were built to replace demolished Medieval churches. The new churches were larger and could hold more people inside. This was needed because the population of Sweden was increasing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church building","offset":78},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":129},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":175},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":202},{"uri":"Esaias_Tegn%C3%A9r","surface_form":"Esaias Tegn\u00E9r","offset":237},{"uri":"Diocese_of_V%C3%A4xj%C3%B6","surface_form":"Diocese of V\u00E4xj\u00F6","offset":269},{"uri":"Church_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Church of Sweden","offset":293},{"uri":"Neoclassicism","surface_form":"Neoclassicist","offset":364},{"uri":"Tower","surface_form":"tower","offset":402}]}
