Romney is now a mile from the sea, separated from it by Dungeness, which is a large pebble beach.\nThe Federation of Cinque Ports includes various other towns on the coast. These are called \"limbs\" of the Cinque Ports.\nThe Federation is supported by two towns, one of which is Rye, and the other (a few miles back from the coast) is Winchelsea. These towns once supported militias which could be used for defence of the area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rye%2C_East_Sussex","surface_form":"Rye","offset":9},{"uri":"Silt","surface_form":"silt","offset":139},{"uri":"Dungeness","surface_form":"Dungeness","offset":206},{"uri":"Pebble","surface_form":"pebble","offset":234},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":241},{"uri":"Winchelsea","surface_form":"Winchelsea","offset":482}]}
