{"id":474590,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wheat","text":"Common wheat (\"Triticum aestivum\"), also known as bread wheat'\", is a cultivated wheat species. About 95% of the wheat produced is common wheat.\nCommon wheat has been got by many generations of artificial selection by farmers choosing the most productive plants which occurred in their crops.\nEvolution.\nBread wheat is an allohexaploid, instead of the original two sets (diploid). There are six sets of chromosomes, two sets from each of three different species. Free-threshing wheat is closely related to spelt wheat. As with spelt, genes from goatgrass (\"Aegilops tauschii\") give bread wheat greater cold hardiness than most wheats. It is cultivated throughout the world's temperate zones.\nOf the six sets of chromosomes, two come from einkorn wheat and two from \"Aegilops speltoides\". This hybridisation created the species \"Triticum turgidum\", 580820 thousand years ago. The last two sets of chromosomes came from \"Aegilops tauschii\", 230\u2013430 thousand years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":81},{"uri":"Artificial_selection","surface_form":"artificial selection","offset":194},{"uri":"Crops","surface_form":"crops","offset":286},{"uri":"Polyploidy","surface_form":"allohexaploid","offset":322},{"uri":"Diploid","surface_form":"diploid","offset":371},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":478},{"uri":"Spelt","surface_form":"spelt","offset":506},{"uri":"Temperate_zone","surface_form":"temperate zone","offset":675},{"uri":"Einkorn_wheat","surface_form":"einkorn wheat","offset":738}]}
