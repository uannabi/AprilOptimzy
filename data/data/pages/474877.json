It was known as Threshold when it was being developed and announced at a press event on 30 September 2014. It came out for PCs on 29 July 2015. Beginning on that day, Windows 10 was available as a free upgrade for users running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 for one year.\nWindows 10 is designed to provide a common, \"universal\" user interface for various systems. These include desktop, laptop, and all-in-one PCs, tablet computers, smartphones, and embedded systems such as the Xbox game console. This allows Microsoft to integrate each type of platform with greater ease.\nUnlike earlier versions of Windows, Windows 10 is regularly updated with new features based on user feedback, including before it was first released. Microsoft releases updates every half a year, an example of the software as a service principle. Each release has four-digit build number (a type of version number), the first two digits referring to the year of release, and the other two digits referring to the month of release (e.g. \"1903\" refers to a build released in March 2019).\nVersions.\nWindows 10 has many versions for different uses, that have different features.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":25},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":45},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":70},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"PCs","offset":240},{"uri":"Windows_7","surface_form":"Windows 7","offset":345},{"uri":"Windows_8.1","surface_form":"Windows 8.1","offset":359},{"uri":"User_interface","surface_form":"user interface","offset":441},{"uri":"Desktop","surface_form":"desktop","offset":491},{"uri":"Laptop","surface_form":"laptop","offset":500},{"uri":"All-in-one_PC","surface_form":"all-in-one","offset":512},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"PCs","offset":523},{"uri":"Tablet_computer","surface_form":"tablet computer","offset":528},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":546},{"uri":"Embedded_system","surface_form":"embedded system","offset":563},{"uri":"Xbox","surface_form":"Xbox","offset":592},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"game console","offset":597},{"uri":"Feedback","surface_form":"feedback","offset":787},{"uri":"Software_as_a_service","surface_form":"software as a service","offset":901}]}
