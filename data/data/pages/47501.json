{"id":47501,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protectorate","text":"e=\"preserve\">In British history, the Protectorate was the period 1653\u201359 during which the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland was governed by a Lord Protector.\nBefore the Protectorate, England (and then Scotland and Ireland) had been ruled directly by Parliament since it had declared England to be a Commonwealth in 1649. The Rump Parliament had been sent away in April 1653 by soldiers led by Oliver Cromwell. Although the replacement, the Barebones Parliament (July\u2013December 1653), was nominated by Cromwell and the leaders of the army, it was just as difficult to control.\nThe post of Lord Protector was created by a constitution passed in December 1653. Cromwell got this position for life. Although the constitution divided power between the Lord Protector, the Council of State and Parliament, in practice there was again the strong executive power that had been absent since the end of the monarchy. Cromwellian government has been called \u2018one of the first experiments in (\"de facto\") military dictatorship\u2019 (Abbott).\nDuring the Protectorate there was Puritan legislation. Religious toleration was extended to Jews and most Protestants, but not to Anglicans or Roman Catholics.\nAfter Cromwell's death in September 1658, the new Lord Protector, Richard Cromwell, was unable to control the army and resigned in May 1659. After a chaotic \u2018interregnum\u2019, the monarchy was restored in May 1660, through the initiative of General George Monck.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_England","surface_form":"Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland","offset":90},{"uri":"Lord_Protector","surface_form":"Lord Protector","offset":154},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":195},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":213},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":226},{"uri":"An_Act_declaring_England_to_be_a_Commonwealth","surface_form":"declared England to be a Commonwealth","offset":286},{"uri":"Rump_Parliament","surface_form":"Rump Parliament","offset":337},{"uri":"Oliver_Cromwell","surface_form":"Oliver Cromwell","offset":405},{"uri":"Barebones_Parliament","surface_form":"Barebones Parliament","offset":452},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":631},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"monarchy","offset":908},{"uri":"Dictatorship","surface_form":"dictatorship","offset":1012},{"uri":"Puritan","surface_form":"Puritan","offset":1070},{"uri":"Freedom_of_religion","surface_form":"Religious toleration","offset":1091},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":1128},{"uri":"Protestants","surface_form":"Protestants","offset":1142},{"uri":"Anglican","surface_form":"Anglican","offset":1166},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholics","offset":1179},{"uri":"English_Interregnum","surface_form":"interregnum","offset":1354},{"uri":"English_Restoration","surface_form":"restored","offset":1385},{"uri":"George_Monck","surface_form":"George Monck","offset":1441}]}
