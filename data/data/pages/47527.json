{"id":47527,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum","text":"A checksum is a number. It is a kind of redundancy check. There are different ways to calculate it. It serves as a check, that no errors have been made when writing down the number. In its simplest form, the digits are simply added up. This can however not detect errors of swapping digits around. Better ways (algorithms) of calculating a checksum are to use a Hamming code, a cyclic redundancy check or modular arithmetic. One of the uses of checksums is to check that account numbers have been entered correctly.\nIf 000201231234567890154 (the bank account number without the dots) is divided by 97, the answer is 207458809978249 remainder 1. Since the remainder is \"1\", the bank account identifier is probably correct. If the person writing down the number missed a digit, swapped two digits around or wrote a digit down incorrectly the remainder would not have been \"1\". If this is the case then the computer should detect an error and give an error message.\nAnother place where checksums are used are serial numbers for computer software.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":16},{"uri":"Redundancy_check","surface_form":"redundancy check","offset":40},{"uri":"Numerical_digit","surface_form":"digits","offset":208},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":311},{"uri":"Hamming_code","surface_form":"Hamming code","offset":362},{"uri":"Cyclic_redundancy_check","surface_form":"cyclic redundancy check","offset":378},{"uri":"Modular_arithmetic","surface_form":"modular arithmetic","offset":405},{"uri":"Account","surface_form":"account","offset":471},{"uri":"Divide","surface_form":"divide","offset":587},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":632},{"uri":"Error","surface_form":"error message","offset":948},{"uri":"Serial_number","surface_form":"serial number","offset":1006}]}
