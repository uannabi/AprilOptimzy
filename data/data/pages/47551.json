{"id":47551,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit","text":"=\"preserve\">Numerical digits are the number text characters used to show numerals. For example, the numeral \"56\" has two digits: 5 and 6. In the decimal system (which is base 10), each digit is how many of a certain power of 10 are needed to get the value. The rightmost, or units digit, is for 10^0, the next digit is for 10^1, etc.\nThe numeral \"56\" means:\u00A0 6*10^0 + 5*10^1 = 6*1 + 5*10 = 6 + 50.\nThe ten digits of the decimal system are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Some numeral systems need more than ten digits. For example, the hexadecimal numeral system uses 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":44},{"uri":"Numeral","surface_form":"numeral","offset":73},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal system","offset":145},{"uri":"Numeral_system","surface_form":"numeral system","offset":479},{"uri":"Hexadecimal_numeral_system","surface_form":"hexadecimal numeral system","offset":539}]}
