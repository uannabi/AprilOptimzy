{"id":475673,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Church","text":"The Oscar Church () a church building in the town of Stockholm in Sweden. It's is a three-aisled hall church. It holds 1,250 people. In the southwestern part of the church building is a tower. The church was inaugurated in September 1903. It was build following a design competition nine years earlier. Gustaf Hermansson won the competition. He also designed the Sofia Church. The church is located in the southeastern part of \u00D6stermalm. It is placed where Storgatan and Narvav\u00E4gen meet near the Swedish History Museum. Together with nearby Strandv\u00E4gen Narvav\u00E4gen is one of the Stockholm's main boulevards. The road is lined with several residential palaces. The church is also visible from Narvav\u00E4gen.\nThe church was named after king Oscar II of Sweden. Oscar II himself laid the foundation stone 1897. Construction work was delayed several times because of problems with the foundation and non-deliveries as well as labour strikes. This led to the church not being consecrated until 1903. The church was originally meant to be partly clad in brick. This was changed to a uniformly white fa\u00E7ade, clad in limestone and marble. Construction was criticised from the start for its Gothic Revival.\nThe church underwent several renovations during the 20th century. Between 1921\u20131923 major changes were done to the interior. During those years new stained glass windows designed by Emanuel Vigeland were added. The work was led under the direction of architect Lars Israel Wahlman. He had previously designed the Engelbrekt Church. Between 1954\u20131956 additional changes were made to the church interior. During those years the altarpiece was changed and some ornamental ceiling decorations were removed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church building","offset":22},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":53},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":66},{"uri":"Hall_church","surface_form":"hall church","offset":97},{"uri":"Gustaf_Hermansson","surface_form":"Gustaf Hermansson","offset":303},{"uri":"Sofia_Church","surface_form":"Sofia Church","offset":363},{"uri":"%C3%96stermalm","surface_form":"\u00D6stermalm","offset":427},{"uri":"Storgatan%2C_Stockholm","surface_form":"Storgatan","offset":457},{"uri":"Narvav%C3%A4gen","surface_form":"Narvav\u00E4gen","offset":471},{"uri":"Swedish_History_Museum","surface_form":"Swedish History Museum","offset":496},{"uri":"Strandv%C3%A4gen","surface_form":"Strandv\u00E4gen","offset":541},{"uri":"Boulevard","surface_form":"boulevard","offset":595},{"uri":"Oscar_II_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Oscar II of Sweden","offset":735},{"uri":"Foundation_stone","surface_form":"foundation stone","offset":781},{"uri":"Strike_action","surface_form":"labour strikes","offset":918},{"uri":"Fa%C3%A7ade","surface_form":"fa\u00E7ade","offset":1089},{"uri":"Gothic_Revival","surface_form":"Gothic Revival","offset":1178},{"uri":"Renovation","surface_form":"renovation","offset":1223},{"uri":"Stained_glass","surface_form":"stained glass","offset":1342},{"uri":"Emanuel_Vigeland","surface_form":"Emanuel Vigeland","offset":1376},{"uri":"Lars_Israel_Wahlman","surface_form":"Lars Israel Wahlman","offset":1455},{"uri":"Engelbrekt_Church","surface_form":"Engelbrekt Church","offset":1507},{"uri":"Altarpiece","surface_form":"altarpiece","offset":1620}]}
