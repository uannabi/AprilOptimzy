He was a member of both the Landtag of Saxony and the Reichstag during the Weimar Republic.\nSome time after Hitler's rise to power Ulbricht fled to France and later to the Soviet Union. As leader of the communist Ulbricht Group he returned to Berlin on April 30, 1945. He was the first secretary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED), and leading East Germany from 1950 to 1971. From President Wilhelm Pieck's death in 1960, he was also the East German head of state until his own death in 1973.\nBesides being a sports fanatic, Ulbricht considered himself an expert on architecture and urban planning, and was therefore responsible for the destruction of several ancient buildings in East Germany.\nHe was also involved in intellectual activities by writing a series of books about the history of the German labor movement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":61},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":68},{"uri":"Weimar_Republic","surface_form":"Weimar","offset":144},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"Communist Party of Germany","offset":155},{"uri":"Landtag","surface_form":"Landtag","offset":217},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Saxony","offset":228},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"Reichstag","offset":243},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":337},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":361},{"uri":"Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"Socialist Unity Party","offset":492},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Pieck","surface_form":"Wilhelm Pieck","offset":580},{"uri":"Fanatic","surface_form":"fanatic","offset":705},{"uri":"Urban_planning","surface_form":"urban planning","offset":772},{"uri":"Labor_movement","surface_form":"labor movement","offset":993}]}
