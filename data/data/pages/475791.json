{"id":475791,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_Symphony","text":"\"Silly Symphony\" was a series of animated short films produced by Walt Disney Productions from 1929 to 1939.\nDisney studios.\nAfter the films changed to sound, Walt Disney began making Mickey Mouse and musical \"Silly Symphony\" shorts. To keep costs down Disney produced his own music. Disney's first music director and composer was Carl Stalling. The Mickey Mouse shorts used pop music while the Silly Symphony cartoons used Classical music. In 1932 the studio produced its first cartoon in Technicolor, \"Flowers and Trees\". The success of the song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?, from the Silly Symphony short \"Three Little Pigs\" (1933), convinced Disney to keep producing original music. It was at this time Disney introduced the characters of Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto and Minnie Mouse. Over its ten year run, \"Silly Symphonies\" had won Walt Disney the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film seven times. This record was matched only by \"Tom and Jerry\". The series spawned numerous imitators and competitors.
