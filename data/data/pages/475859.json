The old wooden church was originally in B\u00E4ckaby outside Vetlanda. The church was later purchased by a private person and moved to the town park in J\u00F6nk\u00F6ping. In J\u00F6nk\u00F6ping, it was reopened on 31 August 1902. Back in B\u00E4ckaby, B\u00E4ckaby Old Church had been replaced by the newer B\u00E4ckaby Church in 1899.\nOn late Friday evening, 28 April 2000 a fire totally destroyed the church. Soon, it was learnt that the fire was caused by arson. Local press brought major attention to the fire when it appeared to be connected to satanism. and modern paganism. Many people missed the church because it had been popular a place for weddings and baptism.\nIn 2003 a memorial site was opened.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church building","offset":36},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":55},{"uri":"B%C3%A4ckaby","surface_form":"B\u00E4ckaby","offset":151},{"uri":"Vetlanda","surface_form":"Vetlanda","offset":167},{"uri":"J%C3%B6nk%C3%B6ping_town_park","surface_form":"town park","offset":245},{"uri":"J%C3%B6nk%C3%B6ping","surface_form":"J\u00F6nk\u00F6ping","offset":258},{"uri":"B%C3%A4ckaby_Church","surface_form":"B\u00E4ckaby Church","offset":385},{"uri":"Satanism","surface_form":"satanism","offset":623},{"uri":"Modern_paganism","surface_form":"modern paganism","offset":637},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":724},{"uri":"Infant_baptism","surface_form":"baptism","offset":737}]}
