{"id":475923,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo","text":"\"Charlie Hebdo\" (French pronunciation: \u200B[]; French for \"Weekly Charlie\") is a French satirical weekly newspaper, featuring cartoons, reports, and jokes. It was founded by Georges Bernier and Fran\u00E7ois Cavanna in 1970.\nThe stories and cartoons they publish are very left-wing and anarchist, with primarily political satire. Following a long tradition in France, called anti-clericalism, the magazine strongly criticized all religions; it has often published caricatures of Jews, Muslims or Christians (especially Catholics). Some Islamic fundamentalists were offended at some cartoons, and repeatedly sent death threats to the journalists of \"Charlie Hebdo\".\nOn 7 January 2015, there was a massacre at their office, in which six journalists and cartoonists were killed. This massacre was a shock to millions of people in the world. It was felt to many people like an attack on the freedom of speech, which is an essential part of a democracy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":78},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":123},{"uri":"Georges_Bernier","surface_form":"Georges Bernier","offset":171},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Cavanna","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois Cavanna","offset":191},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":264},{"uri":"Anarchist","surface_form":"anarchist","offset":278},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":314},{"uri":"Anti-clericalism","surface_form":"anti-clericalism","offset":367},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":422},{"uri":"Caricature","surface_form":"caricature","offset":456},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":471},{"uri":"Muslims","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":477},{"uri":"Christians","surface_form":"Christians","offset":488},{"uri":"Catholics","surface_form":"Catholics","offset":511},{"uri":"Islamic_fundamentalism","surface_form":"Islamic fundamentalists","offset":528},{"uri":"Charlie_Hebdo_shooting","surface_form":"massacre at their office","offset":688},{"uri":"Freedom_of_speech","surface_form":"freedom of speech","offset":879},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":930}]}
