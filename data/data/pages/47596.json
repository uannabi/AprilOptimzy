{"id":47596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellyjackie","text":"Jackie Chan Hiu-ki (\u9673\u66C9\u742A), also known as Kellyjackie (born 23 August, 1986), is a Hong Kong citizen who enjoys singing as a hobby. She is also a member of a band called the Royals. She likes the pop singer Kelly Chen, so she puts \"Kelly\" in her nickname.\nShe was a secondary school student before 2005. She started to put her songs on the Internet from the age of 13, although she mostly sang other singers' songs. After about one year, she started writing her own songs. Her own first song was \"Lucky Voice\" which, like her other songs, was put on the Internet for others to listen.\nIn January 2005, she wrote the song \"He invites me to Disneyland\" (\u4ED6\u7D04\u6211\u53BB\u8FEA\u58EB\u5C3C) to ease her exam stress. She got the ideas of the song from the story Sleeping Beauty.\nShe uploaded her song \"He invites me to Disneyland\" to her band's forum, her Xanga site, i010.com and also cmidi.com for free downloading by Internet users. The song became very famous with the help of the Internet within a few weeks. The song was also number 1 of Yahoo! Hong Kong's Top Searches (\u641C\u5C0B\u4EBA\u6C23\u699C) for some time. Some DJs also played the song on the radio. Many people were happy about her, although some also thought she did not have good singing skills.\nWhen the Hong Kong Disneyland opened, the \"Hong Kong Disneyland -The Grand Opening Celebration Album\" (\u9999\u6E2F\u8FEA\u58EB\u5C3C\u6A02\u5712\u958B\u5E55\u7D00\u5FF5\u5927\u789F) was sold in public. Kellyjackie and Kelly Chen sang \"He invites me to Disneyland\" together in the album.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"23_August","surface_form":"23 August","offset":58},{"uri":"1986","surface_form":"1986","offset":69},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":81},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":91},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"singing","offset":110},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":156},{"uri":"Royals","surface_form":"Royals","offset":172},{"uri":"Pop_singer","surface_form":"pop singer","offset":194},{"uri":"Kelly_Chen","surface_form":"Kelly Chen","offset":205},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":244},{"uri":"Secondary_school","surface_form":"secondary school","offset":264},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":281},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":338},{"uri":"January_2005","surface_form":"January 2005","offset":586},{"uri":"Sleeping_Beauty","surface_form":"Sleeping Beauty","offset":729},{"uri":"Xanga","surface_form":"Xanga","offset":823},{"uri":"Downloading","surface_form":"downloading","offset":872},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":952},{"uri":"Yahoo%21","surface_form":"Yahoo!","offset":1011},{"uri":"DJs","surface_form":"DJs","offset":1071},{"uri":"Hong_Kong_Disneyland","surface_form":"Hong Kong Disneyland","offset":1218}]}
