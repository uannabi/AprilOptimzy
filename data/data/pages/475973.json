{"id":475973,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_i5","text":"Intel Core i5 is a name that Intel uses for the computer processors it makes for desktop and laptop computers.\nThe first Core i5 is a version of the earlier Core i7, the Lynnfield core. Lynnfield Core i5 processors have an 8 MB L3 cache. They have a DMI (Direct Media Interface) bus running at 2.5 GT/s. Core i5 also has support for dual-channel DDR SDRAM memory and have Hyper-threading disabled. A new feature called Turbo Boost Technology was introduced which maximizes speed for demanding computer programs. This increases performance to match the amount of work the computer must do.\nThe Core i5-5xx mobile processors are named Arrandale. They are based on the 32nm Westmere shrink of the Nehalem microarchitecture. Arrandale processors have integrated graphics capability but only two processor cores. They were released in January 2010. Clarkdale, is the desktop version of Arrandale. These are the first processors to have integrated video. It has Hyper-Threading enabled and the full 4\u00A0MB L3 cache.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Intel","surface_form":"Intel","offset":29},{"uri":"Processor","surface_form":"processor","offset":57},{"uri":"Version","surface_form":"version","offset":134},{"uri":"Intel_Core_i7","surface_form":"Core i7","offset":157},{"uri":"Cache","surface_form":"cache","offset":231},{"uri":"Direct_Media_Interface","surface_form":"Direct Media Interface","offset":255},{"uri":"DDR_SDRAM","surface_form":"DDR SDRAM","offset":346},{"uri":"Turbo_Boost_Technology","surface_form":"Turbo Boost Technology","offset":419},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":493},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"performance","offset":527},{"uri":"Mobile_processor","surface_form":"mobile processor","offset":605},{"uri":"Arrandale","surface_form":"Arrandale","offset":633},{"uri":"Microarchitecture","surface_form":"microarchitecture","offset":702},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated","offset":747},{"uri":"Graphics_Processing_Unit","surface_form":"graphics","offset":758},{"uri":"Multi-core_processor","surface_form":"processor cores","offset":791},{"uri":"Clarkdale","surface_form":"Clarkdale","offset":844},{"uri":"Video_card","surface_form":"video","offset":942}]}
