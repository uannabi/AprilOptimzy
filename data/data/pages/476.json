{"id":476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadamia_nut","text":"The macadamia nut is the fruit of a tree that first came from the east coast of Australia. There is\nmore than one kind of Macadamia tree. Only one kind is grown for food.\nThe tree is an evergreen (stays green all year long). It grows up to high. It has groups of small white flowers. It grows best in subtropical (wet and always warm) climates. It needs well-drained soil (water can flow away easily) and of rain a year.\nThe nutmeat (the soft part inside the shell that can be eaten) is mostly a creamy white color. Sometimes it looks a bit yellow. It has a flavor that many people like. Macadamias are eaten roasted (cooked) by themselves. They are used in cookies, cakes, pastries, and candies. People use them like almonds and cashews as part of cooked meals. This is an Oriental style of cooking.\nThe first commercial orchard was started in Australia in the late 1880s. Commercial production started in Hawaii during the 1920s. Production later spread to California, Mexico, and other places with warm climate.\nMacadamias are poisonous to dogs. A dog usually needs 24 to 48 hours to recover fully after eating macadamias.The plant is in the Proteaceae family of flowering plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":36},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":71},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":80},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":165},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":186},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":275},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":301},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":367},{"uri":"Flavor","surface_form":"flavor","offset":558},{"uri":"Roast","surface_form":"roast","offset":609},{"uri":"Cookie","surface_form":"cookie","offset":658},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":667},{"uri":"Pastry","surface_form":"pastries","offset":674},{"uri":"Candy","surface_form":"candies","offset":688},{"uri":"Almond","surface_form":"almond","offset":718},{"uri":"Cashew","surface_form":"cashew","offset":730},{"uri":"Far_East","surface_form":"Oriental","offset":774},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commercial","offset":811},{"uri":"Orchard","surface_form":"orchard","offset":822},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":907},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":959},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":971},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":1006},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":1030},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":1043},{"uri":"Proteaceae","surface_form":"Proteaceae","offset":1145}]}
