To start the game, a player bakes cookies by clicking on a giant cookie. One cookie is gained each time it is clicked. With sufficient cookies to use as currency, a player can buy items and upgrades that will bake more cookies. They will also increase the number of cookies per click. There is no true end to the game.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"JavaScript","surface_form":"JavaScript","offset":33},{"uri":"Browser_video_game","surface_form":"browser video game","offset":50},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":80},{"uri":"Cookies","surface_form":"cookies","offset":148},{"uri":"Click","surface_form":"click","offset":222},{"uri":"Giant","surface_form":"giant","offset":236},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":330}]}
