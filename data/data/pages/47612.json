On November 21, 2005, the court ruled that he did not committed the crime, because what the victim said seemed not to match his own words.\nDeep also acted in movies like \"New Police Story\". He is also famous for his number 1 hit song, \"Select the Breakup Day\" (\u64C7\u65E5\u5931\u6200). A new album, \"Nowhere\" (pronounced as Now-here), was sold in public in September 2005. This album was seen as a comeback for Deep after a number of bad news. He also had another new album, \"Documentary\", in 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":45},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":55},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":66},{"uri":"Emperor_Entertainment_Group","surface_form":"Emperor Entertainment Group","offset":79},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"USD","offset":127},{"uri":"Cocaine","surface_form":"cocaine","offset":150},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":162},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":170},{"uri":"Tsim_Sha_Tsui","surface_form":"Tsim Sha Tsui","offset":239},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":338},{"uri":"Victim","surface_form":"victim","offset":362},{"uri":"New_Police_Story","surface_form":"New Police Story","offset":441},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":544}]}
