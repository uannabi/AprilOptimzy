Their stadium is Lambeau Field. Their quarterback is Aaron Rodgers. The Packer's uniforms are a green or white jersey with yellow pants.\nThe Packers hold the record for the most NFL league championships. They have won 13 championships, including four Super Bowls, out of the 5 they've been too. The team is called the Packers because their original owner was a meat-packing company. Today, it is the only fan-owned team in the country's four major professional leagues. It is owned by a community-based group with more than 100,000 shareholders. Each shareholder is limited to holding 200 shares (out of about 5 million issued). The Packers are also the only team in the major professional leagues to release their balance sheet every year. This year, their current head coach is Matt LaFleur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":29},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":38},{"uri":"Green_Bay%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Green Bay, Wisconsin","offset":55},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":94},{"uri":"Lambeau_Field","surface_form":"Lambeau Field","offset":137},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":158},{"uri":"Aaron_Rodgers","surface_form":"Aaron Rodgers","offset":173},{"uri":"Super_Bowl","surface_form":"Super Bowl","offset":371}]}
