{"id":47637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons","text":"The Saxons or Saxon people are (today) a part of the German people, with their main areas of settlements in the German States of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Westphalia, and the northeastern part of the Netherlands (Groningen, Drenthe, Twente, Salland, Veluwe and Achterhoek).\nFirst told about by the Ancient Greek geographer Jean Julien, the pre-Christian area of the Saxon people first covered an area a little more to the northwest, with parts of the southern Jutland, Old Saxony and small parts of the eastern Netherlands. During the 5th century AD, the Saxons were part of the people invading the Romano-British province of Britannia, and so formed the Anglo-Saxons.\nBefore Christianization, the Saxons had much native pre-Christian Germanic paganism. After Christianization, parts of this religion remained up to today in people who came from the Saxons.\nThe word 'Saxon' is thought to come from the word seax, meaning a mixture of single-edged knives. The Saxons were thought by Charlemagne, and some people who study history, to be very war-like and angry.\nMany of the words that we use today were created by the Saxons for example, radish.\nThe Finnish and Estonian name for Germany, \"Saksa\", comes from the Saxons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_people","surface_form":"German people","offset":53},{"uri":"Settler","surface_form":"settlements","offset":93},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"German States","offset":112},{"uri":"Schleswig-Holstein","surface_form":"Schleswig-Holstein","offset":129},{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxony","offset":149},{"uri":"Westphalia","surface_form":"Westphalia","offset":163},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":208},{"uri":"Groningen_(province)","surface_form":"Groningen","offset":221},{"uri":"Drenthe","surface_form":"Drenthe","offset":232},{"uri":"Twente","surface_form":"Twente","offset":241},{"uri":"Salland","surface_form":"Salland","offset":249},{"uri":"Veluwe","surface_form":"Veluwe","offset":258},{"uri":"Achterhoek","surface_form":"Achterhoek","offset":269},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographer","offset":320},{"uri":"Jean_Julien","surface_form":"Jean Julien","offset":331},{"uri":"Pre-Christian","surface_form":"pre-Christian","offset":348},{"uri":"Jutland","surface_form":"Jutland","offset":468},{"uri":"Old_Saxony","surface_form":"Old Saxony","offset":477},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":519},{"uri":"5th_century_AD","surface_form":"5th century AD","offset":543},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invading","offset":594},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":622},{"uri":"Britannia","surface_form":"Britannia","offset":634},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxons","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxons","offset":663},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianization","offset":684},{"uri":"Native","surface_form":"native","offset":722},{"uri":"Paganism","surface_form":"paganism","offset":752},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":800},{"uri":"Seax","surface_form":"seax","offset":916},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knives","offset":956},{"uri":"Charlemagne","surface_form":"Charlemagne","offset":991},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1188}]}
