{"id":476463,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfried_von_Tschirnhaus","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (or Tschirnhausen) (10 April 1651 \u2013 11 October 1708) was a German mathematician, physicist, doctor, and philosopher.\nLate in the seventeenth century, he was charged with making a survey of the minerals of Saxony. He had a government position there. He and his assistant, Johann Friedrich B\u00F6ttger, discovered how to make porcelain.\nBefore that, it had only been made in Asia.\nTschirnhaus's work in mathematics is remembered in the Tschirnhaus transformation. It removed some intermediate terms from a given algebraic equation. He is also remembered in the Tschirnhausen cubic.\nHis work in physics included work in optics. Working with Martin Knorr, he developed an improved polishing technique. This was used in the lenses and mirrors he made. He made burning glasses of high quality. He used these in experiments.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":114},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":129},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":152},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":241},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Saxony","offset":253},{"uri":"Johann_Friedrich_B%C3%B6ttger","surface_form":"Johann Friedrich B\u00F6ttger","offset":319},{"uri":"Tschirnhaus_transformation","surface_form":"Tschirnhaus transformation","offset":478},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":554},{"uri":"Tschirnhausen_cubic","surface_form":"Tschirnhausen cubic","offset":603},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":636},{"uri":"Optics","surface_form":"optics","offset":661},{"uri":"Mirror","surface_form":"mirror","offset":774},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":849}]}
