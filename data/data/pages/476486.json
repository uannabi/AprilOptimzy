Some of their best known hits were \"There Goes Another Love Song\" (1975), \"Green Grass and High Tides\" (1975) and \"Ghost Riders In The Sky\".\nLike other southern rock bands, the Outlaws used two lead guitars. However, the Outlaws\u2019 used three and four part vocal harmonies which made them different to other southern rock bands who usually had a single lead singer.\nOver the years there has been many changes in the band's members. The current line up includes Henry Paul and Monte Yoho who were original band members. The other three original members, Hughie Thomasson, Billy Jones and Frank O'Keefe have all died.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country_rock","surface_form":"country rock","offset":27},{"uri":"Southern_rock","surface_form":"Southern rock","offset":72},{"uri":"Country_rock","surface_form":"country rock","offset":86}]}
