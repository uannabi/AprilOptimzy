{"id":476510,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier","text":"Brigadier is an army rank, the seniority of which depends on the country. In the British tradition, this officer commands a brigade, which is one-third of a division. As well as the British Army and the Royal Marines, this also applies to the Australian Army, the Indian Army, the New Zealand Army and the Pakistan Army. The rank is above Colonel and below Major-General. The badge on the uniform is three pips with a national symbol on top.\nIn other countries it is a non-commissioned rank (e.g. Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands). Instead, these countries use Brigadier general as equivalent. All NATO forces use OF-6 as the equivalent rank.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":16},{"uri":"Brigade","surface_form":"brigade","offset":124},{"uri":"Division_(military)","surface_form":"division","offset":157},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":182},{"uri":"Royal_Marines","surface_form":"Royal Marines","offset":203},{"uri":"Australian_Army","surface_form":"Australian Army","offset":243},{"uri":"Indian_Army","surface_form":"Indian Army","offset":264},{"uri":"New_Zealand_Army","surface_form":"New Zealand Army","offset":281},{"uri":"Pakistan_Army","surface_form":"Pakistan Army","offset":306},{"uri":"Colonel","surface_form":"Colonel","offset":339},{"uri":"Major-General","surface_form":"Major-General","offset":357},{"uri":"Brigadier_general","surface_form":"Brigadier general","offset":566},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":603}]}
