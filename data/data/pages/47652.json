{"id":47652,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph","text":"A heterotroph (Greek \"heteros\" = another and \"trophe\" = nutrition) is an organism that requires organic substrates to get its carbon for growth and development.\nIn food chains.\nA heterotroph is known as a consumer in the food chain. Consumers are organisms that cannot make their own food supply. They use the food that producers make, or they eat other organisms. Animals are consumers. To stay alive, consumers must get food from other organisms. There are three types of consumers:Herbivores, Carnivores, and Omnivores.\nHerbivores.\nConsumers that only eat plants are called herbivores. The word herbivore comes from the Latin words \"herba\", which means \"grass or herb,\" and \"vorare\", which means \"to eat.\" A giraffe is an example of a herbivorous consumer.\nCarnivores.\nConsumers that only eat animals are called carnivores. The word comes from the Latin \"carnis\", which means \"flesh\", and \"vorare\", which means \"to eat.\" A tiger is an example of a carnivorous consumer.\nOmnivores.\nConsumers that eat both plants and animals are called omnivores. The word comes from the Latin \"omnis\", which means \"all\" and \"vorare\". Humans are a good example of an omnivorous consumer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":15},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":73},{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic","offset":96},{"uri":"Substrate","surface_form":"substrate","offset":104},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":126},{"uri":"Food_chain","surface_form":"food chain","offset":221},{"uri":"Giraffe","surface_form":"giraffe","offset":711},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":926}]}
