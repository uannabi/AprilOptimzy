{"id":476531,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_%27Em_Up","text":"\"Hit 'Em Up\" is a diss song by American rapper 2Pac. The song also features his group the Outlawz. It was released on June 4, 1996. The song is the B-side for the song \"How Do U Want It\", released on June 4, 1996, from 2Pac's fifth studio album \"All Eyez on Me\".\nThe song attacks many East Coast rappers and mainly attacks 2Pac's former friend and rival The Notorious B.I.G. The song was a big part in causing the East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry to worsen. \"Hit 'Em Up\" is considered to be one of the greatest \"diss songs\" ever recorded because of the explicit lyrics and the seriousness of violent intent by 2Pac and his friends towards their rivals.\nProducer Johnny \"J\" said that Shakur was first fueled by his anger against Biggie and Bad Boy Records because he thought that they had a part in the November 30, 1994 ambush and attack on Shakur. Shakur was also angry at Biggie's release of \"Who Shot Ya?\" only months after the shooting happened, and even though it did not mention his name, Shakur believed that it was directed towards him, but it was not. Shakur admitted that he had released \"Hit 'Em Up\" as a response to \"Who Shot Ya?\", almost two months after the 1994 ambush.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diss_song","surface_form":"diss song","offset":18},{"uri":"Tupac_Shakur","surface_form":"2Pac","offset":47},{"uri":"Outlawz","surface_form":"Outlawz","offset":90},{"uri":"A-side_and_B-side","surface_form":"B-side","offset":148},{"uri":"How_Do_U_Want_It","surface_form":"How Do U Want It","offset":169},{"uri":"All_Eyez_on_Me","surface_form":"All Eyez on Me","offset":246},{"uri":"East_Coast_hip_hop","surface_form":"East Coast rappers","offset":285},{"uri":"The_Notorious_B.I.G.","surface_form":"The Notorious B.I.G.","offset":354},{"uri":"East_Coast%E2%80%93West_Coast_hip_hop_rivalry","surface_form":"East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry","offset":414},{"uri":"Bad_Boy_Records","surface_form":"Bad Boy Records","offset":744},{"uri":"Who_Shot_Ya%3F","surface_form":"Who Shot Ya?","offset":900}]}
