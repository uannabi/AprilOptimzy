{"id":476540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauveine","text":"Mauveine was also known as aniline purple and Perkin's mauve. It was the first synthetic organic chemical dye, discovered by accident in 1856.\nHistory.\nIn 1856, William Henry Perkin, then 18, was given a challenge by his professor to synthesize quinine. His professor, August Wilhelm von Hofmann, was the first director of the Royal College of Chemistry in London.\nIn one attempt, Perkin oxidized aniline using potassium dichromate. This failed, but cleaning the flask with alcohol, Perkin noticed the alcohol had turned purple.\nThe dye turned out to be suitable for silk and other textiles. It was patented by Perkin, who the next year opened a dyeworks mass-producing it at Greenford on the banks of the Grand Union Canal in London.\nIt was originally called \"aniline purple\" or \"Tyrian purple\", the name of an ancient natural dye got from a mollusc. In 1859, the colour got the name \"mauve\" in England from the French name for the mallow flower, and chemists later called it \"mauveine\". By 1870, the huge demand dropped when other colours were launched in the synthetic dye industry. Mauvine was the first of many.\nThe structure of mauveine was not fully identified until 1994.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemical","offset":89},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":106},{"uri":"William_Henry_Perkin","surface_form":"William Henry Perkin","offset":161},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesize","offset":234},{"uri":"Quinine","surface_form":"quinine","offset":245},{"uri":"Royal_College_of_Chemistry","surface_form":"Royal College of Chemistry","offset":327},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":357},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidized","offset":388},{"uri":"Aniline","surface_form":"aniline","offset":397},{"uri":"Potassium_dichromate","surface_form":"potassium dichromate","offset":411},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":567},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":582},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":599},{"uri":"Greenford","surface_form":"Greenford","offset":676},{"uri":"Grand_Union_Canal","surface_form":"Grand Union Canal","offset":706},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":727},{"uri":"Tyrian_purple","surface_form":"Tyrian purple","offset":781},{"uri":"Natural_dye","surface_form":"natural dye","offset":820},{"uri":"Mollusc","surface_form":"mollusc","offset":843},{"uri":"Mauve","surface_form":"mauve","offset":886},{"uri":"Malva","surface_form":"mallow","offset":933},{"uri":"Synthetic_dye","surface_form":"synthetic dye","offset":1062}]}
