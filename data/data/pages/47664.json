{"id":47664,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram","text":"A diagram is usually a two-dimensional display which communicates using visual relationships. It is a simplified and structured visual representation of concepts, ideas, constructions, relations, statistical data, anatomy etc. It may be used for all aspects of human activities to explain or illustrate a topic.\nDiscussion.\nIn science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more generally: \"diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and maps, line graphs, bar charts, engineering blueprints, and architects' sketches are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not\". On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically \"abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent\".\nVisual thinking.\nDiagrams affect the mind so that the viewer comes to understand them, but not in the way one understands words. Visual thinking or problem-solving is very ancient, and largely automatic. One only has to remember that the brain puts together an image of the world around us based on sensory input, mostly sight. We do not make any conscious decisions: it is done without conscious thought. Diagrams most likely \"tap in\" to some of these ancient \u2013 but largely unknown \u2013 routines.\nIn fact these normally hidden brain processes do sometimes become apparent. When brain damage affects the visual cortex, or when visual illusions are created, are two classic examples.\nThe way some diagrams affect thinking is quite important. Mendeleev's periodic table summarised previous research on the elements. Far more important, though, was the way it suggested the properties of elements which were \"not yet discovered\". This diagram stimulated creative thought, and other examples from the history of science could be given: see Feynman diagram.\nSome main diagram types.\nSchematics and other types of diagrams, e.g.,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Graphic_design","surface_form":"visual","offset":72},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":153},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":163},{"uri":"Relation","surface_form":"relation","offset":185},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":214},{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":493},{"uri":"Line_graph","surface_form":"line graph","offset":499},{"uri":"Bar_chart","surface_form":"bar chart","offset":512},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":524},{"uri":"Blueprint","surface_form":"blueprint","offset":536},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":552},{"uri":"Sketch_(drawing)","surface_form":"sketch","offset":564},{"uri":"Mendeleev","surface_form":"Mendeleev","offset":1513},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":1525},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"elements","offset":1576},{"uri":"Feynman_diagram","surface_form":"Feynman diagram","offset":1808},{"uri":"Schematic","surface_form":"Schematic","offset":1850}]}
