{"id":476941,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_era","text":"=\"preserve\">The Regency era was nine years from 1811 to 1820 in Great Britain. It was the time when the future George IV of the United Kingdom was Prince Regent during the long illness of his father, George III. George IV was crowned after George III's death in 1820. The Regency era was notable for its excesses, its political uncertainty, and its style. Beau Brummell, Lord Byron and the architect John Nash were important people.\nThe final defeat of Napoleon happened during this era. A rapid growth in population led to the growth of criminal slums in cities like London. It was a great time for architecture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":64},{"uri":"George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George IV of the United Kingdom","offset":111},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"Regent","offset":154},{"uri":"George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George III","offset":200},{"uri":"Excess","surface_form":"excesses","offset":304},{"uri":"Uncertain","surface_form":"uncertainty","offset":328},{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":349},{"uri":"Beau_Brummell","surface_form":"Beau Brummell","offset":356},{"uri":"Lord_Byron","surface_form":"Lord Byron","offset":371},{"uri":"John_Nash_(architect)","surface_form":"John Nash","offset":400},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":453},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":506},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"criminal","offset":538},{"uri":"Slum","surface_form":"slum","offset":547},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":600}]}
