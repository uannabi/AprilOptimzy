{"id":477067,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire","text":"A spire is a tapering conical or pyramidal structure on the top of a building, particularly a church tower. Etymologically, the word comes from the Old English word \"spir\", meaning a sprout, shoot, or stalk of grass.\nSymbolically, spires have two effects. One is to show strength and power. A spire, with its spear point, gives the impression of strength. The other is to reach up toward the skies as a religious gesture. This is one reason for its association with religious buildings, and a similar reason has been given for the large pyramids in Egypt and early American civilisations. However, the tallest spires today are secular places of business or hotels, such as The Shard.\nAs an architectural ornament, spires are most often found on Christian churches.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cone","surface_form":"conical","offset":22},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":33},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":94},{"uri":"Tower","surface_form":"tower","offset":101},{"uri":"Etymology","surface_form":"Etymologically","offset":108},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":148},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":210},{"uri":"Gesture","surface_form":"gesture","offset":413},{"uri":"Secular","surface_form":"secular","offset":627},{"uri":"The_Shard","surface_form":"The Shard","offset":673},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architectural","offset":690},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":745}]}
