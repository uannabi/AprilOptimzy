The stories were created by Max Lundgren\nPlot.\nThe series consists of four novels. It depicts a soccer club which is promoted across a promotion and relegation-based Swedish league system. Finally, they lose the Allsvenskan qualifying game. In 1985, a TV series based on the book series was made.\nSometimes, sports journalists talk of the \"real \u00C5sh\u00F6jdens BK\". That occurs when a club, often in rural districts, quickly is promoted from the lower to higher divisions within some seasons. An example is Ljungskile SK. That club was promotion higher and higher during the early-mid 1990s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer club","offset":61},{"uri":"Scania","surface_form":"Scania","offset":89},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":99},{"uri":"Max_Lundgren","surface_form":"Max Lundgren","offset":135},{"uri":"Promotion_and_relegation","surface_form":"promotion and relegation","offset":242},{"uri":"Swedish_football_league_system","surface_form":"Swedish league system","offset":273},{"uri":"Allsvenskan","surface_form":"Allsvenskan","offset":319},{"uri":"%C3%85sh%C3%B6jdens_BK_(TV_series)","surface_form":"TV series based on the book series","offset":359},{"uri":"Ljungskile_SK","surface_form":"Ljungskile SK","offset":608}]}
