He was the son of Cantonese-speaking Chinese immigrants. He was convicted in Indonesia for drug trafficking as a member of the Bali Nine. In 2005, he was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were believed to have arranged the heroin smuggling operation. After a criminal trial on 14 February 2006, Chan was sentenced to execution by firing squad. While in prison, Chan converted to Christianity.\nOn 16 January 2015, Chan and Sukumaran were ordered to be executed after nine years in jail.

On 24 April 2015, the government ordered the final preparations for the execution of Chan and Sukumaran, as well as eight others on death row. The pair, along with seven other death row inmates, were given a 72-hour notice of their executions on 25 April (ANZAC Day).\nOn 27 April 2015, Chan married his Indonesian fiancee Febyanti Herewila.\nHe was executed by firing squad on 29 April 2015.
