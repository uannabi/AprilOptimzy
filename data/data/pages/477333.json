He was born in London, England. His parents were Sri Lankan immigrants. He moved to Australia at a young age.\nIn 2005, Sukumaran was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were the apparent co-ringleaders of the heroin smuggling operation. After a criminal trial on 14 February 2006, Sukumaran was sentenced to execution by firing squad.\nOn 30 December 2014, Sukumaran's request for clemency was rejected by the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo. Sukumaran and Chan were in prison at Nusakambangan Island in isolation cells. On 16 January 2015, Sukumaran and Chan were ordered to be executed after nine years in jail. On 6 February 2015, it was stated that Chan and Sukumaran would be executed by the end of the month. On 11 February 2015, Indonesian authorities approved the move of Chan and Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Nusakambangan Island in preparation for execution. On 24 February 2015, a final appeal to save Chan and Sukumaran from execution, with their lawyers appeal bid to challenge President Widodo's refusal to grant clemency, failed.
