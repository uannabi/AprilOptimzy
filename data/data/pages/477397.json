{"id":477397,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_sentence","text":"e=\"preserve\">A simple sentence (sometimes called an independent clause) is a sentence that contains a subject and a predicate (a verb). It also must express a complete thought. This follows the rules of syntax in English grammar.\nSimple or dependent?\nA simple sentence or independent clause is one that has a meaning to a reader or listener. If the sentence does not complete the thought, it may be a dependent clause. A dependent clause is one that does not express a complete thought. By itself it is a sentence fragment. It may look like a simple sentence, but it will not make sense on its own.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":77},{"uri":"Subject_(grammar)","surface_form":"subject","offset":102},{"uri":"Predicate","surface_form":"predicate","offset":116},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":129},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntax","offset":203},{"uri":"English_grammar","surface_form":"English grammar","offset":213},{"uri":"Clause","surface_form":"clause","offset":284},{"uri":"Dependent_clause","surface_form":"dependent clause","offset":401},{"uri":"Fragment","surface_form":"fragment","offset":514}]}
