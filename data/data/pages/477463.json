{"id":477463,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space","text":"e=\"preserve\">Euclidean space is the space Euclidean geometry uses. In essence, it is described in Euclid's \"Elements\". The Euclidean plane (formula_1) and three-dimensional space (formula_1) are part of Euclidean space, which can be generalized to any dimension \"n\" (in which case one writes formula_1).\nEuclidian space is sometimes called Cartesian space. A few other spaces and mathematical objects that are similar were added later. Euclid based his work \"Elements\" on certain axioms. Euclidean space can be described using such axioms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Euclidean_geometry","surface_form":"Euclidean geometry","offset":42},{"uri":"Euclid_of_Alexandria","surface_form":"Euclid's","offset":98},{"uri":"Euclid%27s_Elements","surface_form":"Elements","offset":108},{"uri":"Plane_(geometry)","surface_form":"Euclidean plane","offset":123},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"three-dimensional space","offset":155},{"uri":"Axiom","surface_form":"axiom","offset":480}]}
