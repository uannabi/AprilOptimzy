{"id":477743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turpentine","text":"e=\"preserve\">Turpentine (spirit of turpentine, oil of turpentine, wood turpentine) or turps is a solvent and a source of materials for organic synthesis.\nTurpentine is a solvent fluid got by distilling resin from live trees, mainly pines. It is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. As a solvent, turpentine is used for thinning oil-based paints, for producing varnishes, and as a raw material for the chemical industry.\nThe word \"turpentine\" comes from the Greek word \u03C4\u03B5\u03C1\u03B5\u03B2\u03B9\u03BD\u03B8\u03AF\u03BD\u03B7 \"terebinthine\", the name of a species of tree, the terebinth tree.\nIt is hazardous. It is dangerous to inhale, and can cause fires. Because of this, white spirit (mineral turps) or other substitutes are often used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":97},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesis","offset":143},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distilling","offset":191},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":202},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"pine","offset":232},{"uri":"Hydrocarbons","surface_form":"hydrocarbons","offset":266},{"uri":"Oil_paint","surface_form":"oil-based paints","offset":326},{"uri":"Varnish","surface_form":"varnish","offset":358},{"uri":"Pistacia_terebinthus","surface_form":"terebinth","offset":529},{"uri":"White_spirit","surface_form":"white spirit","offset":627}]}
