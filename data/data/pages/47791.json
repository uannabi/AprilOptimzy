{"id":47791,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_bat","text":"Vampire bats is a subfamily of bats. Unlike other bats, vampire bats feed on blood. Currently, there are three species of bats known to do this. All of them live in the Americas, in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina. Of the three known species, one feeds on the blood of mammals, the other two on the blood of birds.\nThe common vampire bat lives in large groups, of up to 100 animals. They have developed complex social behaviour.\nVampire bats commonly spread diseases, most notably rabies. The saliva of the vampire bats contain chemicals that prevent the clotting of the blood of the victim; this has been used to develop drugs to help the patients of strokes and heart attacks.\nThe false vampire bats are not vampire bats; they do not feed on blood, some eat fruits, others devour small animals.\nVampires may be modelled on bats.\nScientific studies.\nVampire bats were some of the first animals studied using the broadly applicable tracking system, or BATS. Scientists glued very small backpacks with sensors onto vampire bats and used GPS to tell when they looked for food, rested, or met each other. The study, which was printed for people to read on October 31, 2019 (Halloween), said that vampire bats formed social bonds when being held by humans that they remembered after being released back into the wild.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":31},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":77},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":165},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":182},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":190},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":198},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":208},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":273},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":312},{"uri":"Common_vampire_bat","surface_form":"common vampire bat","offset":323},{"uri":"Rabies","surface_form":"rabies","offset":485},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":656},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":668},{"uri":"False_vampire_bat","surface_form":"false vampire bat","offset":687},{"uri":"Vampire","surface_form":"Vampire","offset":801},{"uri":"Broadly_applicable_tracking_system","surface_form":"broadly applicable tracking system","offset":917},{"uri":"GPS","surface_form":"GPS","offset":1040},{"uri":"Halloween","surface_form":"Halloween","offset":1175}]}
