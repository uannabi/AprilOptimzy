{"id":47800,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LD50","text":"e=\"preserve\">The name LD50 is an abbreviation for \"Lethal Dose, 50%\" or median lethal dose. It is the amount of the substance required (usually per body weight) to kill 50% of the test population.\nThe test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927 but has been phased out. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve non-animal alternatives to LD50, in response to research cruelty concerns and the lack of validity/sensitivity of animal tests as they relate to humans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
