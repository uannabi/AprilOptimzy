{"id":47804,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Guinness%2C_1st_Baron_Moyne","text":"e=\"preserve\">Walter Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne DSO & Bar PC (29 March 1880-6 November 1944) was a British politician. Guinness was born in Dublin, Ireland.\nFrom 1907 to 1931 he was Conservative MP for Bury St Edmunds, and saw service in World War I at Passchendaele, earning a medal and bar (second award).\nHe was killed in 1944 in Cairo, Egypt by the Jewish terrorist group Lehi. His assassination was said to be a message to the British government against British imperialism. Guinness was selected because he was believed to be anti Jewish and made statements supporting sending all Jews in Europe to the African island of Madagascar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Distinguished_Service_Order","surface_form":"DSO","offset":53},{"uri":"Medal_bar","surface_form":"& Bar","offset":57},{"uri":"Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council","surface_form":"PC","offset":63},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":104},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":145},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":153},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative","offset":187},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"MP","offset":200},{"uri":"Bury_St_Edmunds","surface_form":"Bury St Edmunds","offset":207},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":243},{"uri":"Passchendaele","surface_form":"Passchendaele","offset":258},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":338},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":345},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":358},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":365},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"assassination","offset":391},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":437},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":445},{"uri":"Imperialism","surface_form":"imperialism","offset":472},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":600},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":614},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":622},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":632}]}
