As a result, popular listings of influential African-Americans have repeatedly included him. On March 19, 1968, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said: \"We're going to let our children know that the only philosophers that lived were not Plato and Aristotle, but W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke came through the universe.\"\nEarly career.\nLocke was born on September 13, 1886 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were both schoolteachers.
