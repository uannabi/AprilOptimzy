{"id":47810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Talking","text":"Modern Talking was a German dance pop duo consisting of Thomas Anders and Dieter Bohlen. Their music was often classified as Europop. Modern Talking is, by sales, the most successful and popular group in Germany, and they a number of hit singles reaching the top-5 in many countries. Some of their most popular and widely known singles are \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", \"You Can Win If You Want\", \"Cheri Cheri Lady\", \"Brother Louie\", \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\" and \"Geronimo's Cadillac\".\nModern Talking's first period of activity was from 1984 to 1987. The duo reunified in 1998 and made a successful comeback, releasing more music from 1998 to 2003. Modern Talking's sound, however, was rather different from its original 1980s sound after its reunion. The duo came back in 1998 recording their materials based on what the demand was in central European music markets at the time in the late 1990s, which required their original 1980s mellow Europop sound to switch into 1990s up-tempo Eurodance. The duo released singles which again entered the top-10 not only in their home country but also abroad. Some of those singles were \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98\", \"Brother Louie '98\", and \"You Are Not Alone\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dance_pop","surface_form":"dance pop","offset":28},{"uri":"Thomas_Anders","surface_form":"Thomas Anders","offset":56},{"uri":"Dieter_Bohlen","surface_form":"Dieter Bohlen","offset":74},{"uri":"Europop","surface_form":"Europop","offset":125},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":204},{"uri":"You%27re_My_Heart%2C_You%27re_My_Soul","surface_form":"You're My Heart, You're My Soul","offset":341},{"uri":"You_Can_Win_If_You_Want","surface_form":"You Can Win If You Want","offset":376},{"uri":"Cheri_Cheri_Lady","surface_form":"Cheri Cheri Lady","offset":403},{"uri":"Brother_Louie_(Modern_Talking_song)","surface_form":"Brother Louie","offset":423},{"uri":"Atlantis_Is_Calling_(S.O.S._for_Love)","surface_form":"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)","offset":440},{"uri":"Geronimo%27s_Cadillac_(Modern_Talking_song)","surface_form":"Geronimo's Cadillac","offset":484},{"uri":"Europop","surface_form":"Europop","offset":961},{"uri":"Eurodance","surface_form":"Eurodance","offset":1005},{"uri":"You%27re_My_Heart%2C_You%27re_My_Soul_%2798","surface_form":"You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98","offset":1148},{"uri":"Brother_Louie_%2798","surface_form":"Brother Louie '98","offset":1187},{"uri":"You_Are_Not_Alone_(Modern_Talking_song)","surface_form":"You Are Not Alone","offset":1212}]}
