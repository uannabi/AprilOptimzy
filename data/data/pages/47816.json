{"id":47816,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami","text":"The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, also called the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (known by the scientific community), was a great underwater earthquake. It happened at 00:58:53 UTC (07:58:53 local time) December 26, 2004.\nThe epicenter of the earthquake was off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. At first, the earthquake was measured as a 9.0 on the Richter scale. It was the longest ever recorded ocean earthquake. It lasted between 500 (8.3 minutes) and 600 (10 minutes) seconds. It was so powerful that it caused the entire Earth to vibrate. It started other earthquakes as far away as Iceland.\nThe Asian tsunami.\nThe large movement of earth under the water caused a very large and powerful tsunami. The tsunami was called the \"Asian tsunami\", or the \"Boxing Day tsunami\" in Australia, Canada, England, and South Africa because it happened on the 26th of December 2004 (Boxing Day). It spread all over the Indian Ocean. The tsunami caused heavy damage to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. It also devastated the eastern coast of India, such as the states of Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.\nWaves as high as 30m (100ft) killed many people and damaged or destroyed a lot of buildings and other property. Over 225,000 people died or were not found after the tsunami. The wave did damage in East Africa as far away as South Africa (8000km/ 5000mi) where as many as 8 people died because of high water caused by the wave. Because of how much damage was caused and the number of people the earthquake affected, over $7 billion (USD) was donated to help rebuild the areas damaged.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":149},{"uri":"UTC","surface_form":"UTC","offset":185},{"uri":"Epicenter","surface_form":"epicenter","offset":234},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":279},{"uri":"Sumatra","surface_form":"Sumatra","offset":288},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":297},{"uri":"Richter_scale","surface_form":"Richter scale","offset":362},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":539},{"uri":"Vibration","surface_form":"vibrate","offset":548},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":601},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":706},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":790},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":801},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":809},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":822},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":921},{"uri":"Damage","surface_form":"damage","offset":960},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":970},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":988},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":998},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":1008},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":1022},{"uri":"Tamil_Nadu","surface_form":"Tamil Nadu","offset":1102},{"uri":"Orissa","surface_form":"Orissa","offset":1114},{"uri":"Andhra_Pradesh","surface_form":"Andhra Pradesh","offset":1125},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"Wave","offset":1141},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":1160},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"ft","offset":1166},{"uri":"Kill","surface_form":"kill","offset":1170},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":1223},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":1338},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1365},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"km","offset":1383},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mi","offset":1391},{"uri":"US_dollar","surface_form":"USD","offset":1573},{"uri":"Donation","surface_form":"donated","offset":1582}]}
