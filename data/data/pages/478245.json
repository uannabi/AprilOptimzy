{"id":478245,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(1997)","text":"SummerSlam (1997) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was held on August 3, 1997 at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It was the tenth SummerSlam event held by the WWF.\nThe main event saw Bret Hart defeat The Undertaker and win the WWF Championship with Shawn Michaels acting as the special guest referee. Hart won the match by pinfall after he spit in Michaels face and Michaels swung a chair, which Hart was able to avoid, and hit The Undertaker.\nDuring the Intercontinental title match between Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin, Owen botched a piledriver which had briefly paralyzed Austin and had left him with many years of neck issues which ultimately forced him to retire at age 37 in 2003. Austin has since said that his neck is in good shape and he is in zero pain after he had a successful neck surgery performed in 2000.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":24},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":47},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"World Wrestling Federation","offset":73},{"uri":"Izod_Center","surface_form":"Continental Airlines Arena","offset":140},{"uri":"East_Rutherford%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"East Rutherford","offset":170},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":187},{"uri":"SummerSlam","surface_form":"SummerSlam","offset":216},{"uri":"Bret_Hart","surface_form":"Bret Hart","offset":269},{"uri":"The_Undertaker","surface_form":"The Undertaker","offset":286},{"uri":"WWE_Championship","surface_form":"WWF Championship","offset":313},{"uri":"Shawn_Michaels","surface_form":"Shawn Michaels","offset":335},{"uri":"Owen_Hart","surface_form":"Owen Hart","offset":578},{"uri":"Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin","surface_form":"Stone Cold Steve Austin","offset":592},{"uri":"Piledriver_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"piledriver","offset":632}]}
