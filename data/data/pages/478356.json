{"id":478356,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_81","text":"Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy. It is in the constellation Ursa Major. It is large. It is about 12 million light-years from Earth. It has an active galactic nucleus (which has a supermassive black hole). For these reasons Messier 81 has been well studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is large and very bright. This makes it a popular object for amateur astronomers to look at.\nMessier 81 was discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1774. The galaxy is sometimes called \"Bode's Galaxy\". In 1779, Pierre M\u00E9chain and Charles Messier reidentified Bode's object. They listed it as Messier 81 in the Messier Catalogue.\nM81 is dusty. Interstellar dust is found in the galaxy's spiral arms. It is connected with star formation areas. The hot blue stars in star formation areas heat the dust and the hot dust emits infrared energy from these areas.\nSupernova.\nOnly one supernova has been seen in Messier 81. The supernova is named SN 1993J. It was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garcia in Spain. At the time, it was the second brightest supernova seen in the 20th century.\nM81 Group.\nMessier 81 is the largest galaxy in the M81 Group. The M81 Group is a group of 34 galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major. This Group and the Local Group, containing the Milky Way, are close together in the Virgo Supercluster.\nAmateur astronomy.\nMessier 81 is about 10\u00B0 northwest of Alpha Ursae Majoris. Messier 81 and Messier 82 can both be easily seen using binoculars and small telescopes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spiral_galaxy","surface_form":"spiral galaxy","offset":58},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":86},{"uri":"Ursa_Major","surface_form":"Ursa Major","offset":100},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":148},{"uri":"Active_galactic_nucleus","surface_form":"active galactic nucleus","offset":182},{"uri":"Supermassive_black_hole","surface_form":"supermassive black hole","offset":219},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":312},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":397},{"uri":"Johann_Elert_Bode","surface_form":"Johann Elert Bode","offset":458},{"uri":"Pierre_M%C3%A9chain","surface_form":"Pierre M\u00E9chain","offset":542},{"uri":"Charles_Messier","surface_form":"Charles Messier","offset":561},{"uri":"Messier_object","surface_form":"Messier Catalogue","offset":641},{"uri":"Interstellar_medium","surface_form":"Interstellar dust","offset":674},{"uri":"Spiral_arm","surface_form":"spiral arm","offset":717},{"uri":"Star_formation","surface_form":"star formation","offset":751},{"uri":"Stellar_classification","surface_form":"blue stars","offset":781},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":853},{"uri":"Supernova","surface_form":"supernova","offset":907},{"uri":"SN_1993J","surface_form":"SN 1993J","offset":969},{"uri":"M81_Group","surface_form":"M81 Group","offset":1165},{"uri":"Galaxy_group","surface_form":"group","offset":1195},{"uri":"Local_Group","surface_form":"Local Group","offset":1268},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":1296},{"uri":"Virgo_Supercluster","surface_form":"Virgo Supercluster","offset":1333},{"uri":"Alpha_Ursae_Majoris","surface_form":"Alpha Ursae Majoris","offset":1409},{"uri":"Binoculars","surface_form":"binoculars","offset":1486},{"uri":"Telescope","surface_form":"telescope","offset":1507}]}
