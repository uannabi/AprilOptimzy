{"id":478383,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housemaid_debate","text":"The housemaid debate or maid debate is a political discussion in Sweden. It begun on 18 July 1993 when Swedish economist Anne-Marie P\u00E5lsson proposed tax deductions for household services.\nMany right-wing politicians supported the proposal. They thought it would reduce unreported employment. Many left-wing politicians expressed negative thoughts. They said it would increase social class gaps. The left-wing politicians pointed to the time before the 1970s, when many girls were employed to live-in and work for wealthier families. The discussion has later reappeared. Often, it has reappeared during elections in Sweden.\nTax deductions, so called RUT deductions for household services, were introducd in Sweden on 1 July 2007. That was during the centre-right Reinfeldt cabinet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":65},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economist","offset":111},{"uri":"Anne-Marie_P%C3%A5lsson","surface_form":"Anne-Marie P\u00E5lsson","offset":121},{"uri":"Tax_deduction","surface_form":"tax deduction","offset":149},{"uri":"Household_service","surface_form":"household service","offset":168},{"uri":"Right-wing_politics","surface_form":"right-wing politicians","offset":193},{"uri":"Unreported_employment","surface_form":"unreported employment","offset":269},{"uri":"Left-wing_politics","surface_form":"left-wing politicians","offset":297},{"uri":"Elections_in_Sweden","surface_form":"elections in Sweden","offset":602},{"uri":"RUT_deductions","surface_form":"RUT deductions","offset":649},{"uri":"Centre-right_politics","surface_form":"centre-right","offset":749},{"uri":"Reinfeldt_cabinet","surface_form":"Reinfeldt cabinet","offset":762}]}
