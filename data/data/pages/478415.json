{"id":478415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planthopper","text":"Planthoppers are insects in the infraorder Fulgoromorpha. They are true bugs (Hemiptera), with over 12,500 described species.\nThey are cryptic mimics: their body shape and colours look like leaves and other plant parts in their environment. They either walk very slowly or hop like grasshoppers.\nMembers of this group are plant-feeders, and live world-wide. Few are pests, but some are vectors for plant diseases. Phytoplasmas which live in the phloem of plants can be transmitted by planthoppers when feeding.\nTheir nymphs have a biological gear mechanism at the base of the hind legs, which keeps the legs in synchrony when the insects jump.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":17},{"uri":"Infraorder","surface_form":"infraorder","offset":32},{"uri":"Hemiptera","surface_form":"Hemiptera","offset":78},{"uri":"Cryptic","surface_form":"cryptic","offset":135},{"uri":"Mimicry","surface_form":"mimics","offset":143},{"uri":"Grasshopper","surface_form":"grasshopper","offset":282},{"uri":"Vector_(biology)","surface_form":"vectors","offset":386},{"uri":"Phytoplasma","surface_form":"Phytoplasma","offset":414},{"uri":"Phloem","surface_form":"phloem","offset":445}]}
