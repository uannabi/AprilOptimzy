{"id":47842,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fret","text":"A fret is a thin metal strip found on string instruments. Guitars, mandolins, and banjos have frets.\nFrets are mounted on the long necks of the instrument. The frets help the musician playing the instrument to know where to place their fingers on the instrument.\nOn historical instruments and some non-European instruments, pieces of string tied around the neck are frets.\nFrets divide the neck into sections related to a musical framework. On instruments such as guitars, each fret marks one semitone in the standard western system where one octave is divided into twelve semitones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"String_instrument","surface_form":"string instrument","offset":38},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"Guitar","offset":58},{"uri":"Mandolin","surface_form":"mandolin","offset":67},{"uri":"Banjo","surface_form":"banjo","offset":82}]}
