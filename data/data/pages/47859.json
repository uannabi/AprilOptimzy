{"id":47859,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Callaghan","text":"Leonard James \"Jim\" Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, (; 27 March 1912\u00A0\u2013 26 March 2005) was a British Labour politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK) from 1976 to 1979.\nBorn in the 1910s, Callaghan was an old-style socialist, lacking any higher education, and served as Member of Parliament (MP) for a Cardiff constituency. He is the only person to have held all three leading UK Cabinet positions (Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary), prior to their premiership. He was never expected to reach the premiership, having taken a back seat to the younger and more charismatic Harold Wilson for many years. However, when Wilson unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1976, Callaghan was the most experienced candidate to replace him. His time as prime minister was one of more open government but the electorate was dissatisfied with his relaxed response to high inflation and more industrial unrest, and replaced Labour with a Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher.\nCallaghan resigned as Leader of the Labour Party shortly afterwards, but remained an MP for some years before being sent to the House of Lords as Baron Callaghan of Cardiff.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour","offset":107},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister of the United Kingdom","offset":139},{"uri":"1910s","surface_form":"1910s","offset":212},{"uri":"Socialist","surface_form":"socialist","offset":246},{"uri":"Higher_education","surface_form":"higher education","offset":269},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":301},{"uri":"Cardiff","surface_form":"Cardiff","offset":333},{"uri":"Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK Cabinet","offset":408},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","surface_form":"Chancellor","offset":430},{"uri":"Home_Secretary","surface_form":"Home Secretary","offset":442},{"uri":"Foreign_Secretary","surface_form":"Foreign Secretary","offset":461},{"uri":"Harold_Wilson","surface_form":"Harold Wilson","offset":618},{"uri":"Open_government","surface_form":"open government","offset":820},{"uri":"Electorate","surface_form":"electorate","offset":844},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":906},{"uri":"Labor_unrest","surface_form":"industrial unrest","offset":925},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative","offset":971},{"uri":"Margaret_Thatcher","surface_form":"Margaret Thatcher","offset":1001},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Leader of the Labour Party","offset":1042},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":1148},{"uri":"Baron","surface_form":"Baron","offset":1166}]}
