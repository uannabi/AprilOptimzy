{"id":478659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitriformes","text":"Accipitriformes is an order which includes most of the diurnal birds of prey: hawks, eagles, vultures, and many others, about 225 species in all.\nFor a long time, the majority view was to include them with the falcons in the Falconiformes. However, a recent DNA study has shown that falcons are not closely related to the Accipitriformes. Instead, they are related to parrots and passerines.\nSince then putting the falcons next to the parrots in taxonomic order has been adopted by most ornithologists. The DNA-based proposal includes the New World vultures in the Accipitriformes, but the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) classifies the New World vultures as a separate order, the Cathartiformes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":22},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":55},{"uri":"Birds_of_prey","surface_form":"birds of prey","offset":63},{"uri":"Hawk","surface_form":"hawk","offset":78},{"uri":"Eagle","surface_form":"eagle","offset":85},{"uri":"Vulture","surface_form":"vulture","offset":93},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":130},{"uri":"Falcon","surface_form":"falcon","offset":210},{"uri":"Falconiformes","surface_form":"Falconiformes","offset":225},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":258},{"uri":"Parrot","surface_form":"parrot","offset":368},{"uri":"Passerine","surface_form":"passerine","offset":380},{"uri":"Parrots","surface_form":"parrots","offset":435},{"uri":"Taxonomic","surface_form":"taxonomic","offset":446},{"uri":"Ornithologist","surface_form":"ornithologist","offset":487},{"uri":"New_World_vulture","surface_form":"New World vulture","offset":539},{"uri":"Cathartiformes","surface_form":"Cathartiformes","offset":686}]}
