{"id":478771,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ice_Baby","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Ice Ice Baby\" is a hip hop single performed by Vanilla Ice. It samples the 1981 song \"Under Pressure\" by Queen and David Bowie. It appeared on his 1989 studio album \"Hooked\". It later appeared on his other album \"To the Extreme\".\n\"Ice Ice Baby\" was first released as the B-side to a cover version of \"Play That Funky Music\". The original version of \"Play That Funky Music\" was a well-liked and popular song with the listening audiences. The cover version was not liked much, so the single was not selling well. But a disc jockey decided to play \"Ice Ice Baby\" instead of the single's A-side. Once the public heard this song, it became more successful than \"Play That Funky Music\".\nThe song hit #1 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hip_hop","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":33},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":41},{"uri":"Vanilla_Ice","surface_form":"Vanilla Ice","offset":61},{"uri":"Sampling_(music)","surface_form":"samples","offset":77},{"uri":"Queen_(band)","surface_form":"Queen","offset":119},{"uri":"David_Bowie","surface_form":"David Bowie","offset":129},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":166},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":220},{"uri":"A-side_and_B-side","surface_form":"B-side","offset":285},{"uri":"Cover_version","surface_form":"cover version","offset":297},{"uri":"Play_That_Funky_Music","surface_form":"Play That Funky Music","offset":315},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":440},{"uri":"Disc_jockey","surface_form":"disc jockey","offset":531},{"uri":"A-side_and_B-side","surface_form":"A-side","offset":598},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":714}]}
