{"id":478828,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control_in_Singapore","text":"e=\"preserve\">Population control in Singapore had two distinct phases. First, to slow and reverse the boom in births that started after World War II. Second, from the 1980s, to encourage parents to have more children because numbers had fallen below replacement levels.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, The Family Planning and Population Board (FPPB) was set up. At first it favoured small families, and later ran the Stop at Two programme. This pushed for small two-children families and promoted sterilisation.\nAs birthrates fell, so the government introduced a policy that encouraged having three or more children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"Population","offset":13},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":35},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":135},{"uri":"Sterilisation","surface_form":"sterilisation","offset":488}]}
