In March 1848 Pope Pius IX offered to him the post of minister in the first constitutional government of the Papal States. However, on 29 April 1848, after the speech with which Pius IX announced the withdrawal of the papal army from the front of the first italian war of independence, Minghetti resigned.\nMember of the \"Historical Right\", he was Minister of the Interior in the governments led by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and Bettino Ricasoli. He was also Minister of the Treasury in the government led by Luigi Carlo Farini. He was twice Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy: from 24 March 1863 to 28 September 1864 and from 10 July 1873 to 25 March 1876.\nIn 1864 Minghetti signed the \"Convention of September\" with France: with this document, Italy renounced in Rome and moved the capital from Turin to Florence. There were many protests against this agreement and consequently Minghetti was forced to resign. During his second experience as President, Minghetti raised taxes to achieve a balanced budget. He was able to accomplish this, but there were protests against his tax policy and was forced to resign for the second time.\nMinghetti was the last president of the \"Historic Right\": after him began the period of the \"Historical Left\", that remained in power until Francesco Crispi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":63},{"uri":"Bologna","surface_form":"Bologna","offset":129},{"uri":"Pope_Pius_IX","surface_form":"Pope Pius IX","offset":185},{"uri":"Papal_States","surface_form":"Papal States","offset":280},{"uri":"Camillo_Benso%2C_Count_of_Cavour","surface_form":"Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour","offset":569},{"uri":"Bettino_Ricasoli","surface_form":"Bettino Ricasoli","offset":604},{"uri":"Luigi_Carlo_Farini","surface_form":"Luigi Carlo Farini","offset":684},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Italy","surface_form":"Kingdom of Italy","offset":739},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":897},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":944},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":976},{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":985},{"uri":"Francesco_Crispi","surface_form":"Francesco Crispi","offset":1453}]}
