{"id":478944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UY_Scuti","text":"e=\"preserve\">UY Scuti is a red supergiant (RSG) or red Hypergiant (RHG) star. It is a pulsating variable star in the constellation Scutum and possibly the largest known star in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is also one of the most luminous and well-known of its kind.\nThe star has an estimated average median radius of 1,708 times that of the Sun, or a diameter of 2.4 trillion m (1.5 billion mi; 15.9 AU); thus a volume 5 billion times that of the Sun.\nIt is about 2.9 kiloparsecs (9,500 light years) from Earth, so it is one of the nearest known hypergiants. If placed at the center of the Solar system, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Jupiter. The radius is not known for certain, and may be larger than the orbit of Saturn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supergiant","surface_form":"supergiant","offset":31},{"uri":"Hypergiant","surface_form":"Hypergiant","offset":55},{"uri":"Variable_star","surface_form":"variable star","offset":96},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":117},{"uri":"Scutum","surface_form":"Scutum","offset":131},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way Galaxy","offset":181},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"luminous","offset":226},{"uri":"Median","surface_form":"median","offset":297},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":304},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":338},{"uri":"Trillion","surface_form":"trillion","offset":364},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":373},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mi","offset":388},{"uri":"Astronomical_unit","surface_form":"AU","offset":397},{"uri":"Parsec","surface_form":"parsec","offset":469},{"uri":"Light_years","surface_form":"light years","offset":484},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":502},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"Solar system","offset":587},{"uri":"Photosphere","surface_form":"photosphere","offset":605},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":634},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":643},{"uri":"Saturn","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":725}]}
