He was one of France's most popular and long lasting singers, and also one of the most well-known French singers in other countries.\nCareer.\nHe appeared in more than 60 movies and written more than 1000 songs (including 150 in English, 100 in Italian, 70 in Spanish, and 50 in German).\nHe has sold over 100 million albums. Aznavour started his final tour in late 2006. Aznavour was born as Shahnour Vaghinag Aznavouryan in Paris, the son of Armenian immigrants Michael Aznavouryan & Knar Baghdasaryan. His parents introduced him to the world of theatre at an early age. He dropped out of school at the age of nine, already aspiring to the life of an artist. He began to perform at this time, and soon took the stage name \"Aznavour\".\nHis big break came when the singer Edith Piaf heard him sing and arranged to take him with her on tour in France and to the USA. Aznavours voice is shaded towards the tenor range, but possesses the low range and coloration more typical of a baritone, contributing to his unique sound.\nDeath.\nOn 1 October 2018 it was announced that Aznavour had died at his home in the village of Mouri\u00E8s in the south of France at the age of 94. An autopsy report said Aznavour died of cardiopulmonary arrest caused by pulmonary edema.\nFilm.\nmovie director Levon Mkrtchyan","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":55},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":64},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":71},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":79},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":94},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":115},{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popular","offset":129},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":223},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":270},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":304},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":328},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":344},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":359},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":378},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":416},{"uri":"Edith_Piaf","surface_form":"Edith Piaf","offset":869},{"uri":"Mouri%C3%A8s","surface_form":"Mouri\u00E8s","offset":1214},{"uri":"Autopsy","surface_form":"autopsy","offset":1266},{"uri":"Cardiopulmonary_arrest","surface_form":"cardiopulmonary arrest","offset":1303},{"uri":"Pulmonary_edema","surface_form":"pulmonary edema","offset":1336},{"uri":"Levon_Mkrtchyan","surface_form":"Levon Mkrtchyan","offset":1374}]}
