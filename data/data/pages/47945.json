{"id":47945,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc","text":"Blu-ray Disc is a high-density optical disc format similar to DVD. Blu-ray is the type of disc used for PlayStation 3 games and for playing high-definition (HD) movies. In the past, there were other standards for such movies, such as the HD DVD format. Blu-ray won what is called the \"format war\".\nA dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50GB (gigabytes) of data. This is over five times the capacity of a DVD, and over 70 times more than a CD or VCD.\nThe disc was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), a group of consumer electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers, and released in 2006. The format was developed for recording, rewriting and playback of high-definition video (HD), as well as storing large amounts of data.\nOlder optical disc technologies such as DVD, DVD\u00B1R, DVD\u00B1RW, and DVD-RAM used a red laser to read and write data. The new format used a blue-violet laser instead. This is where the name is from.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Optical_disc","surface_form":"optical disc","offset":31},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":62},{"uri":"Playstation_3","surface_form":"PlayStation 3","offset":104},{"uri":"High-definition","surface_form":"high-definition","offset":140},{"uri":"HD_DVD","surface_form":"HD DVD","offset":238},{"uri":"Format_war","surface_form":"format war","offset":285},{"uri":"Gigabyte","surface_form":"gigabyte","offset":346},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":408},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CD","offset":443},{"uri":"VCD","surface_form":"VCD","offset":449},{"uri":"Blu-ray_Disc_Association","surface_form":"Blu-ray Disc Association","offset":484},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"personal computer","offset":549},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":833}]}
