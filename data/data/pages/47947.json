{"id":47947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_Cats","text":"The Stray Cats were a Rockabilly band from the United States. They had several hit songs in the 1980s. The Stray Cats played a style of pop music called Rockabilly, which mixes 1950s-style rock and roll, blues music, and country music together. The Stray Cats' music is like the 1950s Rockabilly songs by Elvis Presley and Carl Perkins. Three of the bands' hit songs were \"Runaway Boys,\" \"Rock This Town,\" and \"Stray Cat Strut.\"\nThe Stray Cats band was formed in 1979 by Brian Setzer, with two of his school friends Leon Drucker (who used the stage name \"Lee Rocker\") and James McDonnell (who used the stage name \"Slim Jim Phantom\"). These young men lived in Massapequa, New York.\nThe Stray Cats wore blue jeans and leather jackets, and had their hair slicked back. The Stray Cats had a singer who played electric guitar, a double bass player, and a drummer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rockabilly","surface_form":"Rockabilly","offset":22},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":33},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":47},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":96},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop music","offset":136},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock and roll","offset":189},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":204},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":221},{"uri":"Elvis_Presley","surface_form":"Elvis Presley","offset":305},{"uri":"Carl_Perkins","surface_form":"Carl Perkins","offset":323},{"uri":"Jeans","surface_form":"jeans","offset":706},{"uri":"Electric_guitar","surface_form":"electric guitar","offset":805},{"uri":"Double_bass","surface_form":"double bass","offset":824},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drummer","offset":850}]}
