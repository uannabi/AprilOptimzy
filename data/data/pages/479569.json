{"id":479569,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraplegia","text":"Tetraplegia (or quadriplegia) is a condition in which a human loses use of all limbs and the torso. It usually affects both the ability to move and the use of the senses.\n\"Quadriplegia\" is the common term in North America. \"Tetraplegia\" is the term in Europe.\nTetraplegia is caused by damage either to the brain or to the spinal cord at the level of the cervical vertebrae. People with an injury at the C1 vertebra may lose functions from the neck down. They may need a machine to breathe for them. People with injuries at the C7 vertebra may still be able to use their arms and hands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Limb","surface_form":"limb","offset":79},{"uri":"Torso","surface_form":"torso","offset":93},{"uri":"Sensory_system","surface_form":"senses","offset":163},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":208},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":252},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":306},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":322},{"uri":"Cervical_vertebrae","surface_form":"cervical vertebrae","offset":354},{"uri":"Atlas_(anatomy)","surface_form":"C1 vertebra","offset":403},{"uri":"Arm","surface_form":"arm","offset":570},{"uri":"Hand","surface_form":"hand","offset":579}]}
