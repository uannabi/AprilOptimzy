{"id":47966,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophilia","text":"Coprophilia is a sexual fetish people feel when they come into contact with feces. Coprophilia can be said to be liking the smell, taste, or feel of feces in a sexual way. The feeling can be either through touching the skin or through rubbing the penis head against feces. Enjoyment can also be made from the feeling of feces passing through the anus.\nEating feces is also known as coprophagia. This is bad for one's body. A person who eats feces is at risk of getting sick through hepatitis, infection, and AIDS. Those with a weak immune system should not eat feces. There are also social problems with eating feces. It causes bad breath and is a taboo.\nActually, no one should be eating feces even if they have a strong immune system. The bad breath that comes from eating feces isn't the only taboo, simply putting feces in your mouth is also a taboo.\nThere are people who make movies involving coprophilia. This is called scatology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fetish","surface_form":"fetish","offset":24},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":76},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":149},{"uri":"Glans","surface_form":"penis head","offset":247},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":266},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":320},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":346},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":359},{"uri":"Coprophagia","surface_form":"coprophagia","offset":382},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":441},{"uri":"Hepatitis","surface_form":"hepatitis","offset":482},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":493},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":508},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":561},{"uri":"Bad_breath","surface_form":"bad breath","offset":628},{"uri":"Taboo","surface_form":"taboo","offset":648},{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":881},{"uri":"Scatology","surface_form":"scatology","offset":926}]}
