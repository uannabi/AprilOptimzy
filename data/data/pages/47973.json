{"id":47973,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty","text":"The Kalabhra dynasty ruled over entire Tamil country in South Indian between the 3rd and the 6th century C.E..\nThey won over the ancient Chola, Pandya and Chera dynasties and replaced them. There is little information about their origin and details about their reign. They did not leave any monuments. The only source of information on them are to be found in Buddhist and Jain literature. They were displaced around the 7th century by the revival of Pallava and Pandya power.\nHindu scholars and authors who wrote in the 7th and 8th century C.E. when Pandya and Pallava had taken over again have written very little about the Kalabhra in their texts. Perhaps therefore the period of their rule is known as a \u2018Dark Age\u2019 \u2013 an interregnum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tamil_people","surface_form":"Tamil","offset":39},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":62},{"uri":"Chola_dynasty","surface_form":"Chola","offset":137},{"uri":"Pandya","surface_form":"Pandya","offset":144},{"uri":"Chera_dynasty","surface_form":"Chera","offset":155},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":291},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":360},{"uri":"Jaina","surface_form":"Jain","offset":373},{"uri":"Pallava","surface_form":"Pallava","offset":451},{"uri":"Pandya","surface_form":"Pandya","offset":463},{"uri":"Interregnum","surface_form":"interregnum","offset":724}]}
