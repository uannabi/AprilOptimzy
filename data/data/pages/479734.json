{"id":479734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Swan","text":"The Division of Swan is an Australian electoral division located in Western Australia. The division is named after the Swan River.\nIt was one of the 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. Historically, the electorate was a country seat extending north to Dongara, east to Merredin and south to the coast. New boundaries created a smaller area east of the Darling Range.
