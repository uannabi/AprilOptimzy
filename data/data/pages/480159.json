{"id":480159,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_32","text":"WrestleMania 32 was the thirty-second yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event made by WWE. It happened on April 3, 2016 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. It was the third WrestleMania to take place in Texas. WWE also hoped that WrestleMania 32 would break the record for people to show up at a wrestling event, aiming for 100,000 people at AT&T Stadium. At the event they said 101,763 people showed up at WrestleMania 32, breaking 1987's WrestleMania III's record of 93,173. However, wrestling expert Dave Meltzer said only 93,730 people showed up. But this still would break WrestleMania III's record. But Meltzer adds that he believes the record was actually held by SummerSlam's (1992) 79,127 while only 78,000 actually showed up for WrestleMania III. Meltzer has also written that WWE would have said the attendance was higher than it actually was because they didn't want to let their fans down.\nTwelve matches took place at this event and at least two made history. Charlotte went into her match as the WWE Divas Champion, but became WWE Women's Champion at the end of the match and the Divas title has not existed since. After The Rock defeated Erick Rowan, ring announcer Lilian Garcia said that the match ended in six seconds, a WrestleMania record. The previous record wasKane versus Chavo Guerrero, Jr. from WrestleMania XXIV which lasted eleven seconds.\nMatches.\nFandango, Damien Sandow, Shaquille O'Neil, Big Show, Viktor, Diamond Dallas Page, Konnor, Tatanka, Jack Swagger, R-Truth, Goldust, Curtis Axel, Adam Rose, Heath Slater, Tyler Breeze, Mark Henry, Bo Dallas and Darren Young were also in the Andre the Giant memorial battle royal and they were eliminated in that order.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"WrestleMania","surface_form":"WrestleMania","offset":45},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":58},{"uri":"Pay-per-view","surface_form":"pay-per-view","offset":81},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":114},{"uri":"AT%26amp%3BT_Stadium","surface_form":"AT&T Stadium","offset":151},{"uri":"Arlington%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Arlington, Texas","offset":167},{"uri":"WrestleMania_III","surface_form":"WrestleMania III","offset":469},{"uri":"Dave_Meltzer","surface_form":"Dave Meltzer","offset":532},{"uri":"SummerSlam","surface_form":"SummerSlam","offset":700},{"uri":"WWE_Divas_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Divas Champion","offset":1040},{"uri":"WWE_Women%27s_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Women's Champion","offset":1071},{"uri":"Lilian_Garcia","surface_form":"Lilian Garcia","offset":1211},{"uri":"WrestleMania","surface_form":"WrestleMania","offset":1269},{"uri":"Kane_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Kane","offset":1313},{"uri":"Chavo_Guerrero%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Chavo Guerrero, Jr.","offset":1325},{"uri":"WrestleMania_XXIV","surface_form":"WrestleMania XXIV","offset":1350},{"uri":"Fandango_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Fandango","offset":1406},{"uri":"Damien_Sandow","surface_form":"Damien Sandow","offset":1416},{"uri":"Shaquille_O%27Neil","surface_form":"Shaquille O'Neil","offset":1431},{"uri":"Big_Show","surface_form":"Big Show","offset":1449},{"uri":"Rick_Victor","surface_form":"Viktor","offset":1459},{"uri":"Diamond_Dallas_Page","surface_form":"Diamond Dallas Page","offset":1467},{"uri":"Conor_O%27Brian","surface_form":"Konnor","offset":1488},{"uri":"Jack_Swagger","surface_form":"Jack Swagger","offset":1505},{"uri":"Ron_Killings","surface_form":"R-Truth","offset":1519},{"uri":"Goldust","surface_form":"Goldust","offset":1528},{"uri":"Curtis_Axel","surface_form":"Curtis Axel","offset":1537},{"uri":"Adam_Rose","surface_form":"Adam Rose","offset":1550},{"uri":"Heath_Slater","surface_form":"Heath Slater","offset":1561},{"uri":"Tyler_Breeze","surface_form":"Tyler Breeze","offset":1575},{"uri":"Mark_Henry","surface_form":"Mark Henry","offset":1589},{"uri":"Bo_Dallas","surface_form":"Bo Dallas","offset":1601},{"uri":"Darren_Young","surface_form":"Darren Young","offset":1615}]}
