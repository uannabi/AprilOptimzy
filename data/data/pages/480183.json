She was a reviewer for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). She refused to authorize thalidomide for market because she had concerns about the drug's safety.\nHer concerns proved to be justified when it was proven that thalidomide caused serious birth defects. As a result of her blocking American approval of thalidomide, Kelsey was awarded the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by President John F. Kennedy, Kelsey retired from the FDA in 2005, at age 90, after 45 years of service.\nKelsey died at her daughter's home in London, Ontario at the age of 101.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":31},{"uri":"MD","surface_form":"MD","offset":35},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":76},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":85},{"uri":"Pharmacologist","surface_form":"pharmacologist","offset":94},{"uri":"Food_and_Drug_Administration","surface_form":"Food and Drug Administration","offset":142},{"uri":"Thalidomide","surface_form":"thalidomide","offset":203},{"uri":"Birth_defect","surface_form":"birth defect","offset":363},{"uri":"President%27s_Award_for_Distinguished_Federal_Civilian_Service","surface_form":"President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service","offset":463},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
