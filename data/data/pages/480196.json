She has been convicted in the November 9, 2005 Amman bombings in Jordan but survived when her explosive belt failed to detonate. Al-Qaida in Iraq claimed responsibility for the triple bombings that hit three hotels.\nShe was sentenced to death as a result of her involvement in the hotel suicide bombings. Jordan executed her on February 4, 2015 in response for the execution of Jordanian pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh by the ISIS terrorist organization. Jordan had expressed willingness to swap al-Rishawi in exchange for the pilot's safe return, however the pilot had already been killed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":83},{"uri":"Suicide_bomber","surface_form":"suicide bomber","offset":96},{"uri":"2005_Amman_bombings","surface_form":"2005 Amman bombings","offset":154},{"uri":"Explosive_belt","surface_form":"explosive belt","offset":206},{"uri":"Muath_Al-Kasasbeh","surface_form":"Muath Al-Kasasbeh","offset":506},{"uri":"ISIS","surface_form":"ISIS","offset":531}]}
