{"id":480559,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracara","text":"Caracara are birds of prey in the family Falconidae. They live in South and Central America, and the southern USA. Mostly they are not fast fliers, and are scavengers. One species, the red-throated caracara, eats insects and the larvae of bees and wasps.\nTheir classification is somewhat unclear, but some sources say there are five living genera and 11 species. They were all originally put within the genus \"Polyborus\". Extinct species have been found in the La Brea tar pits.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Birds_of_prey","surface_form":"birds of prey","offset":13},{"uri":"Falconidae","surface_form":"Falconidae","offset":41},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South","offset":66},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":76},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":110},{"uri":"Scavenger","surface_form":"scavenger","offset":156},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":172},{"uri":"Larvae","surface_form":"larvae","offset":229},{"uri":"Bees","surface_form":"bees","offset":239},{"uri":"Wasps","surface_form":"wasps","offset":248},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":340},{"uri":"La_Brea_tar_pits","surface_form":"La Brea tar pits","offset":461}]}
