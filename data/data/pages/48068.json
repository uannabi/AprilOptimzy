It is the main part of the Borough of Greenwich, about 8.9\u00A0km east south-east of Charing Cross.\nThe Royal Greenwich Observatory is in Greenwich. It was originally built for the Astronomer Royal. The Oservatory created the Greenwich Meridian (0\u00B0 longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\nGreenwich is a town with a long history. It became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia, from the 15th century. This was the birthplace of many members of the Tudor dynasty, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace became ruined during the English Civil War. It was rebuilt as a hospital by Sir Christopher Wren. These buildings became the a military college in 1873, which lasted until 1998. The town became a popular resort in the 17th century. Many rich houses were built there, such as Vanbrugh Castle (1717). Estates were built above the town centre.\nGreenwich was part of Kent until 1889 when the County of London was created.\nWorld heritage site.\nMaritime Greenwich is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is on the River Thames. The site includes buildings along the riverfront, and surrounding the 17th century Queen's House. The group include the complex of the Royal Hospital for Seamen, the Royal Observatory and the Royal Park.\nThe Royal Hospital was laid out to a master plan created by Christopher Wren. The hospital complex was built over many decades. Other architects who added to this long-term project included Nicholas Hawksmoor.\nThe core of this group of buildings is the Queen's House which was designed by Inigo Jones. This was the first Palladian building in Britain.\nThe Royal Observatory is now the baseline for the world's time zone system and for the measurement of longitude around the globe.\nThe Royal Park is a symmetrical design in an irregular landscape around the buildings of the World Heritage Site. The park was created by Andr\u00E9 Le N\u00F4tre.\nThe park and grounds behind the buildings on the river held the competitions for the horse-related events of the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nPublic transport.\nNational Rail and Docklands Light Railway services call at Greenwich station.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UNESCO World Heritage Site"],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":27},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Greenwich","surface_form":"Borough of Greenwich","offset":62},{"uri":"Charing_Cross","surface_form":"Charing Cross","offset":116},{"uri":"Royal_Greenwich_Observatory","surface_form":"Royal Greenwich Observatory","offset":135},{"uri":"Astronomer_Royal","surface_form":"Astronomer Royal","offset":212},{"uri":"Greenwich_Meridian","surface_form":"Greenwich Meridian","offset":257},{"uri":"Greenwich_Mean_Time","surface_form":"Greenwich Mean Time","offset":295},{"uri":"Palace_of_Placentia","surface_form":"Palace of Placentia","offset":405},{"uri":"House_of_Tudor","surface_form":"Tudor dynasty","offset":496},{"uri":"Henry_VIII_of_England","surface_form":"Henry VIII","offset":521},{"uri":"Elizabeth_I","surface_form":"Elizabeth I","offset":536},{"uri":"English_Civil_War","surface_form":"English Civil War","offset":585},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":624},{"uri":"Christopher_Wren","surface_form":"Christopher Wren","offset":640},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":687},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":696},{"uri":"Resort_town","surface_form":"resort","offset":764},{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":923},{"uri":"County_of_London","surface_form":"County of London","offset":948},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":1023},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":1030},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":1064},{"uri":"Queen%27s_House","surface_form":"Queen's House","offset":1161},{"uri":"Royal_Hospital_for_Seamen","surface_form":"Royal Hospital for Seamen","offset":1213},{"uri":"Royal_Observatory","surface_form":"Royal Observatory","offset":1244},{"uri":"Royal_Park","surface_form":"Royal Park","offset":1270},{"uri":"Christopher_Wren","surface_form":"Christopher Wren","offset":1342},{"uri":"Nicholas_Hawksmoor","surface_form":"Nicholas Hawksmoor","offset":1472},{"uri":"Inigo_Jones","surface_form":"Inigo Jones","offset":1571},{"uri":"Palladian_architecture","surface_form":"Palladian","offset":1603},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Le_N%C3%B4tre","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Le N\u00F4tre","offset":1902},{"uri":"2012_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2012 Summer Olympics","offset":2031},{"uri":"National_Rail","surface_form":"National Rail","offset":2071},{"uri":"Docklands_Light_Railway","surface_form":"Docklands Light Railway","offset":2089},{"uri":"Greenwich_station","surface_form":"Greenwich station","offset":2130}]}
