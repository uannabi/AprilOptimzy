{"id":480734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophil","text":"Basophils, or basophil granulocytes, are rare granulocytes. If you had 10,000 white blood cells, only 1\u201330 of them would be basophils.\nBasophils contain large cytoplasmic granules. When stained, the granules hide the cell nucleus from sight. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has two lobes.\nThe mast cell, another granulocyte, is similar in appearance and function. Both cell types store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they come from different cell lines. Mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead stay in connective tissue. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils go from the blood into a tissue when needed.\nThe name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are stained by basic dyes, as shown in the illustrations.\nHow they work is not well understood. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell membrane which binds IgE, an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defence and allergy. They are found in unusually high numbers at sites of ectoparasite infection, for example, by ticks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Granulocyte","surface_form":"granulocyte","offset":46},{"uri":"Cytoplasm","surface_form":"cytoplasm","offset":159},{"uri":"Cell_nucleus","surface_form":"cell nucleus","offset":217},{"uri":"Lobe","surface_form":"lobe","offset":313},{"uri":"Mast_cell","surface_form":"mast cell","offset":324},{"uri":"Histamine","surface_form":"histamine","offset":417},{"uri":"Connective_tissue","surface_form":"connective tissue","offset":609},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":685},{"uri":"Staining","surface_form":"stained","offset":800},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"basic","offset":811},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":817},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"cell membrane","offset":934},{"uri":"Immunoglobulin","surface_form":"immunoglobulin","offset":968},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":1000},{"uri":"Allergy","surface_form":"allergy","offset":1021},{"uri":"Ectoparasite","surface_form":"ectoparasite","offset":1083},{"uri":"Ticks","surface_form":"ticks","offset":1123}]}
