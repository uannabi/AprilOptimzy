Movie critic Roger Ebert said, \"There are so many good things in \"Random Hearts\", but they're side by side instead of one after the other. They exist in the same film, but they don't add up to the result of the film. Actually, the film has no result\u2014just an ending, leaving us with all of those fine pieces, still waiting to come together. If this were a screenplay and not the final product, you could see how with one more rewrite, it might all fall into place.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":26},{"uri":"Romance_movie","surface_form":"romantic drama","offset":35},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":64},{"uri":"Sydney_Pollack","surface_form":"Sydney Pollack","offset":76},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"produced","offset":99},{"uri":"Random_Hearts_(novel)","surface_form":"novel of the same name","offset":219},{"uri":"Warren_Adler","surface_form":"Warren Adler","offset":245},{"uri":"Rotten_Tomatoes","surface_form":"Rotten Tomatoes","offset":329},{"uri":"Roger_Ebert","surface_form":"Roger Ebert","offset":359}]}
