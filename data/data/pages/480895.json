It was directed by Wes Craven and was produced by Susan Kaplan, Marianne Maddalena, Allan Miller, and Walter Scheuer. \"Music of the Heart\" was released on October 29, 1999. The movie is based on the true story of Roberta Guaspari, who was the co-founder the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music. It is director Wes Craven's movie outside of the horror/thriller genre to date. It was also his first movie to receive an Academy Award nomination.\nThe movie gained mixed reviews from critics and holds a 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars and said, \"Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood.\"\nThe movie was nominated for two Academy Awards; Meryl Streep was nominated for Best Actress and scored songwriter Diane Warren was nominated for Best Original Song for the song \"Music of My Heart\". Streep was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":31},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":40},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed","offset":60},{"uri":"Wes_Craven","surface_form":"Wes Craven","offset":72},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"produced","offset":91},{"uri":"Marianne_Maddalena","surface_form":"Marianne Maddalena","offset":117},{"uri":"Allan_Miller","surface_form":"Allan Miller","offset":137},{"uri":"Roberta_Guaspari","surface_form":"Roberta Guaspari","offset":266},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":466},{"uri":"Rotten_Tomatoes","surface_form":"Rotten Tomatoes","offset":562},{"uri":"Roger_Ebert","surface_form":"Roger Ebert","offset":592},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":1145},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress","surface_form":"Best Actress","offset":1192},{"uri":"Diane_Warren","surface_form":"Diane Warren","offset":1227},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song","surface_form":"Best Original Song","offset":1258},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award","surface_form":"Golden Globe Award","offset":1343},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Motion_Picture_%E2%80%93_Drama","surface_form":"Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama","offset":1381}]}
