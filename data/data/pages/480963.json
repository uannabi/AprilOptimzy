{"id":480963,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority","text":"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a government-chartered corporation that operates public transportation in the U.S. state of New York. The MTA runs buses and trains in 12 counties in southeastern New York. It also runs in two counties in southwestern Connecticut. On weekdays, about 11 million passengers use MTA buses and trains. Over 800,000 vehicles use its seven tolled bridges and two tunnels daily.\nHistory.\nThe MTA was chartered by the New York state government in 1965. In 1965, it was called the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (MCTA). The MTCA was made by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to buy and run the Long Island Rail Road, which run out of money. The MCTA became the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in 1968. In 1968, it combined the operations of the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), which are now MTA New York City Transit (NYCT) and MTA Bridges and Tunnels (B&T).\nThe MTA also took the lease of the Penn Central Transportation's Hudson, Harlem and New Haven commuter rail lines until 1976. In 1976, Conrail took over Penn Central. The MTA did not run these commuter rail lines by itself until 1983. In 1983, it formed the Metro-North Commuter Railroad from the Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines.\nMTA Bridges and Tunnels.\nMTA Bridges and Tunnels is the largest bridge and tunnel toll agency in the United States. More than a million people use its bridges and tunnels each day. MTA Bridges and Tunnels collect $900 million from tolls each year.\nNew York City Transit Authority.\nThe New York City Transit Authority has 7 million riders per day, or over 2 billion a year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":53},{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"corporation","offset":74},{"uri":"Public_transportation","surface_form":"public transportation","offset":100},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":129},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":143},{"uri":"Bus","surface_form":"bus","offset":166},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":176},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"counties","offset":189},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":269},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":304},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":362},{"uri":"Toll_bridge","surface_form":"tolled bridges","offset":385},{"uri":"Toll_tunnel","surface_form":"two tunnels","offset":404},{"uri":"Charter","surface_form":"charter","offset":444},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"Governor","offset":599},{"uri":"Nelson_Rockefeller","surface_form":"Nelson Rockefeller","offset":608},{"uri":"Long_Island_Rail_Road","surface_form":"Long Island Rail Road","offset":646},{"uri":"Lease","surface_form":"lease","offset":1004},{"uri":"Penn_Central_Transportation","surface_form":"Penn Central Transportation","offset":1017},{"uri":"Commuter_rail","surface_form":"commuter rail","offset":1076},{"uri":"Conrail","surface_form":"Conrail","offset":1117},{"uri":"Commuter","surface_form":"commuter","offset":1175},{"uri":"Metro-North_Railroad","surface_form":"Metro-North Commuter Railroad","offset":1240},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1416}]}
