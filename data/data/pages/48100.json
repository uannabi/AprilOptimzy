{"id":48100,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck","text":"John Ernst Steinbeck (; February 27, 1902 - December 20, 1968) was an American writer. Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. Some of his most famous works are \"Of Mice and Men\" (1937) and \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1940), which won a Pulitzer Prize. In these two books, Steinbeck writes about migrant workers during the Great Depression.\nSteinbeck used naturalism in his books. His characters and stories came from real events from the early 20th century. His work shows his wide range of interests, such as politics, history, philosophy and mythology.\nSeventeen of his works were made into Hollywood movies. Steinbeck also tried screen writing, which is writing for movies. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing in Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 movie, \"Lifeboat\".\nEarly life.\nSteinbeck was born to John Ernst Steinbeck Sr., a first-generation German American. He attended Stanford University until 1925 when he left the university in order to become a writer. His first work, \"Cup of Gold\", came out four years later, but was not successful. He married Carol Henning the following year.\nSteinbeck first gained success with the novel \"Tortilla Flat\" in 1935. The story was about two men living in Monterey, California during the Great Depression. The book won the California Commonwealth Club's Gold Medal. It was made into a movie seven years later, starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr, and John Garfield.\nCritical success.\nSteinbeck continued to write on the subject of the Great Depression. Two years later, Steinbeck wrote \"Of Mice and Men\", considered as one of the best works of American literature in the twentieth century. His story dealt with the lives of two migrant laborers with big dreams in California. It was turned into a Hollywood movie in 1939, starring Lon Chaney Jr. as \"Lennie\" and Burgess Meredith as \"George\". That year, Steinbeck followed up with another book, \"The Grapes of Wrath\". The book is about the Joad family and their travels from Oklahoma to California during the Dust Bowl in search of work. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize and movie adaptation won two Academy Awards, and is ranked #7 on the American Film Institute's list, \"100 Years...100 Cheers: America's Most Inspiring Movies\". There was controversy with the book, though. Many people felt that Steinbeck's liberal opinions misrepresented the truth of Dust Bowl migrations. He had this student that his name was Oscar Perez and they would both do the job together.\nLater life.\nSteinbeck continued to write from 1940s to 1960s. He wrote such works as \"The Moon is Down\", \"The Pearl\", \"Cannery Row\", \"East of Eden\" and \"The Winter of Our Discontent\". In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize in Literature for \"his realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception.\"\nTwo years later, he was awarded the \"United States Medal of Freedom\" by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died on December 20, 1968 in New York at the age of 66, of a heart disease.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":70},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":79},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Literature","offset":105},{"uri":"Of_Mice_and_Men","surface_form":"Of Mice and Men","offset":175},{"uri":"The_Grapes_of_Wrath","surface_form":"The Grapes of Wrath","offset":204},{"uri":"Pulitzer_Prize","surface_form":"Pulitzer Prize","offset":245},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":331},{"uri":"Naturalism_(literature)","surface_form":"naturalism","offset":364},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":519},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":529},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":538},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythology","offset":553},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":602},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":701},{"uri":"Alfred_Hitchcock","surface_form":"Alfred Hitchcock","offset":746},{"uri":"German_American","surface_form":"German American","offset":868},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":897},{"uri":"Tortilla_Flat","surface_form":"Tortilla Flat","offset":1159},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":1253},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1729},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":1762},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":1989},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":2001},{"uri":"Dust_Bowl","surface_form":"Dust Bowl","offset":2023},{"uri":"Pulitzer_Prize","surface_form":"Pulitzer Prize","offset":2070},{"uri":"Dust_Bowl","surface_form":"Dust Bowl","offset":2369},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Literature","offset":2693},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President","offset":2903},{"uri":"Lyndon_B._Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon B.
