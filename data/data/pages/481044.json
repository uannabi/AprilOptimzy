{"id":481044,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor","text":"e=\"preserve\">Transcription factors help to regulate genes. Each transcription factor binds to a specific DNA sequence. That is how they control the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA.\nA transcription factor is sometimes called a 'sequence-specific DNA-binding factor'. Alone or with other proteins, they promote or block RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase is the enzyme that copies genetic information from DNA to RNA for specific genes.\nTranscription factors have one or more DNA-binding domains (DBDs). These attach to sequences of DNA next to the genes they regulate. Other proteins (such as coactivators, chromatin remodellers, histone acetylases or deacetylases, kinases, and methylases) also play crucial roles in gene regulation. Because they lack DNA-binding domains, they are not called transcription factors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gene_regulation","surface_form":"regulate genes","offset":43},{"uri":"DNA_sequence","surface_form":"DNA sequence","offset":105},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":156},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":205},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":284},{"uri":"Proteins","surface_form":"proteins","offset":325},{"uri":"RNA_polymerase","surface_form":"RNA polymerase","offset":357},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":395},{"uri":"DNA-binding_domain","surface_form":"DNA-binding domain","offset":509},{"uri":"Coactivator_(genetics)","surface_form":"coactivator","offset":627},{"uri":"Chromatin","surface_form":"chromatin","offset":641},{"uri":"Histone","surface_form":"histone","offset":664},{"uri":"Kinase","surface_form":"kinase","offset":700},{"uri":"Methylase","surface_form":"methylase","offset":713},{"uri":"Gene_regulation","surface_form":"gene regulation","offset":752}]}
