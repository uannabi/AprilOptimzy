{"id":48111,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English","text":"The Old English language, often called Anglo-Saxon, was spoken in England from 450 AD to 1100 AD. It was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons who came to England from what is now Germany and Denmark. Different kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England spoke different dialects but a western dialect became the main literary version.\nOld English is very different from Modern English; it has many more Germanic words. In early centuries it was rarely written down, and when written it was in runes. After the 9th century, the Latin alphabet was used more. Old English grammar is difficult, with complex inflection<nowiki/>s, and close to Old German. Latin was used by churchmen like the venerable Bede. Old English gradually turned into Middle English after the Norman Conquest of 1066.\n\"Beowulf\" is written in Old English in an alphabetic script.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":66},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":83},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxons","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxons","offset":119},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":169},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":181},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon_England","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon England","offset":212},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"Modern English","offset":348},{"uri":"Germanic_languages","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":381},{"uri":"Rune","surface_form":"rune","offset":471},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":505},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":547},{"uri":"Inflection","surface_form":"inflection","offset":582},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":621},{"uri":"Bede","surface_form":"Bede","offset":676},{"uri":"Middle_English","surface_form":"Middle English","offset":716},{"uri":"Norman_Conquest","surface_form":"Norman Conquest","offset":741},{"uri":"1066","surface_form":"1066","offset":760},{"uri":"Beowulf","surface_form":"Beowulf","offset":767},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":808}]}
