Three Muslim college students were shot dead. Their neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks was arrested for it. Families of the victims called it a hate crime. Police do not know why Hicks might have done it. Police in Chapel Hill say Hicks had argued with the victims over parking spaces before. Neighbors said Hicks was obsessed over people parking in his space. His Facebook page says he supports \u201CAtheists for Equality\u201D and blamed \u201Cradical Christians and radical Muslims\" for causing problems in the world.\nThe FBI was called in to help the local police.
