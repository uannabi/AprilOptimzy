{"id":481456,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eryops","text":"\"Eryops\" is a genus of extinct, semi-aquatic temnospondyl.\nThey are found mostly in the Lower Permian-aged (about 295\u00A0million years ago) red beds of Texas. Fossils are also found in New Mexico and parts of the eastern United States. \"Eryops\" also occurs in older Pennsylvanian strata of the Conemaugh Group in West Virginia\n\"Eryops\" averaged a little over 1.5-2.0\u00A0meters (5\u20136.5\u00A0ft) long, so it was one of the largest land animals of its time. It weighed about 90\u00A0kilograms (200\u00A0lb). It probably had few predators, although the apex predator of the time was the synapsid \"Dimetrodon\", which was even larger. Several complete skeletons of \"Eryops\" have been found in the Lower Permian, but skull bones and teeth are the most common fossils.\n\"Eryops\" was better adapted to a terrestrial environment than its ancestors. Sturdy limbs and a strong spine supported the body while out of water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":14},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":23},{"uri":"Temnospondyl","surface_form":"temnospondyl","offset":45},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":94},{"uri":"Red_beds","surface_form":"red beds","offset":137},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":149},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"Fossil","offset":156},{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":182},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":218},{"uri":"Pennsylvanian","surface_form":"Pennsylvanian","offset":263},{"uri":"Strata","surface_form":"strata","offset":277},{"uri":"Apex_predator","surface_form":"apex predator","offset":527},{"uri":"Synapsid","surface_form":"synapsid","offset":561},{"uri":"Dimetrodon","surface_form":"Dimetrodon","offset":571},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":624},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":688},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":704},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":730},{"uri":"Terrestrial","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":772}]}
