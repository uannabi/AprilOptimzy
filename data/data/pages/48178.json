{"id":48178,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate","text":"e=\"preserve\">In a modern democracy, a senate is a group of people who are part of a legislature. A legislature passes or changes laws for their country, state, or other area. Members of a senate are called senators. Some legislatures are bicameral, meaning they have two groups of people (working in separate places) called \"houses\". A senate can be called a \"House of Senators\".\nThe senate of some such legislatures is weaker than the other house. The other house is called a \"House of Representatives\", House of Commons, or Assembly. In bicameral legislatures, both houses must pass the same bill to make it a law. Modern democratic systems having legislatures with senates include the United States of America (U. S.), Canada, Australia and many states in the United States.\nThe first ever senate was the Roman Senate. The name comes from their word for \"elder\".\nSenate is also the name of the ruling body of some universities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":25},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":59},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislature","offset":84},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":129},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":144},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":153},{"uri":"Bicameral","surface_form":"bicameral","offset":238},{"uri":"House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":478},{"uri":"House_of_Commons","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":505},{"uri":"Bill","surface_form":"bill","offset":594},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":688},{"uri":"Senate_of_Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":722},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":730},{"uri":"Roman_Senate","surface_form":"Roman Senate","offset":808},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":917}]}
