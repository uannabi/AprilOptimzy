{"id":48186,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kano is a city in Nigeria. It is the center of the Kano State. Kano is the third largest city in Nigeria, after Ibadan and Lagos. About 3,626,204 people live in Kano.\nIt has long been the economic centre of northern Nigeria, and a centre for the sale of groundnuts. Kano is known for the Bayero University and a railway station with trains to Lagos, moving through Kaduna, while Kano International Airport can be found nearby. Kano has long been a centre for Nigeria's Islamic culture; one of the country's finest mosques lies in the city.\nIt is also the site where the Kano river project was developed. This is a large irrigation scheme.\nHistory.\nThe city of Kano was founded around A.D. 1000 as an Hausa city of its own. Kano remained a big emirate, or Muslim kingdom, until the making of the country, Nigeria, in 1903. Kano became known for its trade in gold, leather, ivory, salt and slaves within the area. This perhaps is the reason for the city's wealth and power in the 14th century, when Islam gained a growing following. By the 15th century, the first Central Mosque had been built in the city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":23},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":31},{"uri":"Kano_State","surface_form":"Kano State","offset":64},{"uri":"Ibadan","surface_form":"Ibadan","offset":125},{"uri":"Lagos","surface_form":"Lagos","offset":136},{"uri":"Groundnut","surface_form":"groundnut","offset":267},{"uri":"Kaduna","surface_form":"Kaduna","offset":378},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":482},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":490},{"uri":"A.D.","surface_form":"A.D.","offset":697},{"uri":"1000","surface_form":"1000","offset":702},{"uri":"Hausa","surface_form":"Hausa","offset":713},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":768},{"uri":"1903","surface_form":"1903","offset":829},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":870},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":876},{"uri":"Ivory","surface_form":"ivory","offset":885},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":892},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":901},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"wealth","offset":967},{"uri":"14th_century","surface_form":"14th century","offset":991},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th century","offset":1051}]}
