{"id":481871,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz%27s_Star","text":"e=\"preserve\">Scholz's Star is a nearby star which flew through the Solar System's Oort cloud about 70,000 years ago. It is also called WISE 0720-0846 (more fully: WISE J072003.20-084651.2.\nThis binary star system is now about from the Sun. It is in the southern constellation Monoceros near the Galactic plane. The primary is a red dwarf with times the mass of Jupiter. The secondary is probably a T5 brown dwarf. The system has 0.15 solar masses. The system has an apparent magnitude of 18.3, and is about 3\u201310 billion years old.\nStars probably pass through the Oort cloud every 100,000 years or so. Comets disturbed by the Oort cloud will take about two million years to get to the inner Solar System.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_nearest_stars","surface_form":"nearby star","offset":32},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":67},{"uri":"Oort_cloud","surface_form":"Oort cloud","offset":82},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":194},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":262},{"uri":"Monoceros","surface_form":"Monoceros","offset":276},{"uri":"Galactic_plane","surface_form":"Galactic plane","offset":295},{"uri":"Red_dwarf","surface_form":"red dwarf","offset":328},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":361},{"uri":"Solar_mass","surface_form":"solar mass","offset":434},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":466},{"uri":"Comets","surface_form":"Comets","offset":601}]}
