This large breed is often used as a guard dog and family protector. Despite their looks, they are a big gentle dog with family and friends. They can be trained as guard dogs to protect people or property. Neapolitan Mastiffs need a lot of daily exercise. They are indirectly descended from the Tibetan Mastiff, one of the oldest dog breeds.. The Neapolitan Mastiff descends from the traditional guard dogs of central Italy, that were direct descendants of the \"Canis Pugnax\" of the legions of ancient Rome. It was recognised as a breed by the \"Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana\" in 1949.\nThis breed is closely related to the Cane Corso.\nHistory.\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff derives from the traditional \"Catch dog\" and guard dogs of central Italy (but the distant origin is the \"canis pugnax\" of the Roman legions).Selection of the breed was begun in 1947 by Piero Scanziani, who had seen one at an exhibition in Naples in 1946. He drew up the first \"breed standard\" for the race, which in 1949 was officially recognised by the \"Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana\". It received full acceptance from the \"F\u00E9d\u00E9ration Cynologique Internationale\" in 1956.\nStandards.\nAccording to American Kennel Club (AKC) standards, male Neapolitan Mastiffs should measure 26\u201331\u00A0inches (66\u201379\u00A0cm) at the withers.
