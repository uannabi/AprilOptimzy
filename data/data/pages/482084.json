{"id":482084,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young","text":"=\"preserve\">Maturity onset diabetes of the young, or MODY is any of several hereditary forms of diabetes mellitus caused by gene mutations. The mutations interfere with the making of insulin. MODY is often called monogenic diabetes. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms of the disease.\nThe term \"MODY\" goes back to around 1964.\nIn MODY 2, oral medications or insulin may not be needed. In MODY 1 and MODY 3, insulin may be necessary.\nSome people with MODY may be obese or overweight.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genetic_disorder","surface_form":"hereditary","offset":76},{"uri":"Diabetes_mellitus","surface_form":"diabetes mellitus","offset":96},{"uri":"Gene_mutation","surface_form":"gene mutation","offset":124},{"uri":"Insulin","surface_form":"insulin","offset":183},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":284},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"medication","offset":351},{"uri":"Insulin","surface_form":"insulin","offset":366},{"uri":"Overweight","surface_form":"overweight","offset":479}]}
