{"id":48209,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin","text":"=\"preserve\">Angevin is the name of the residents of Anjou, a former province of the Kingdom of France, as well as to the residents of Angers. It is also used for three different medieval dynasties which go back to counts (from 1360, dukes) of the western French province of Anjou (of which \"angevin\" is the adjectival form), but later came to rule far greater areas including England, Ireland, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, \"Kingdom of Naples and Sicily\", and Kingdom of Jerusalem (\"see Angevin Empire\").\nThe first of these Angevin dynasties, the House of Plantagenet, ruled England in some form or another from the reign of Henry II, beginning in 1154, until the House of Tudor came to power when Richard III fell at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anjou","surface_form":"Anjou","offset":52},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":95},{"uri":"Angers","surface_form":"Angers","offset":134},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"medieval","offset":178},{"uri":"Count","surface_form":"count","offset":214},{"uri":"1360","surface_form":"1360","offset":227},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":255},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":262},{"uri":"Anjou","surface_form":"Anjou","offset":274},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"England","offset":376},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":385},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":394},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":403},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":412},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Jerusalem","surface_form":"Kingdom of Jerusalem","offset":456},{"uri":"Angevin_Empire","surface_form":"Angevin Empire","offset":483},{"uri":"House_of_Plantagenet","surface_form":"House of Plantagenet","offset":543},{"uri":"Henry_II_of_England","surface_form":"Henry II","offset":621},{"uri":"House_of_Tudor","surface_form":"House of Tudor","offset":660},{"uri":"Richard_III_of_England","surface_form":"Richard III","offset":694},{"uri":"Battle_of_Bosworth_Field","surface_form":"Battle of Bosworth Field","offset":718}]}
