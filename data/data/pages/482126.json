{"id":482126,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup","text":"A haplogroup is a group of single chromosomes, or single DNA strands, which share a common ancestor. They have the same mutation in all versions.\nHaplogroups show deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years.\nIn human genetics, the haplogroups usually studied are Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. Both can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed only from father to son, while mtDNA is passed only from mother to children. Neither recombines, and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutations with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chromosomes","surface_form":"chromosomes","offset":34},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":57},{"uri":"Common_ancestor","surface_form":"common ancestor","offset":84},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":120},{"uri":"Human_genetics","surface_form":"human genetics","offset":221},{"uri":"Y-chromosome","surface_form":"Y-chromosome","offset":273},{"uri":"Mitochondrial_DNA","surface_form":"mitochondrial DNA","offset":310},{"uri":"Recombination","surface_form":"recombines","offset":498}]}
