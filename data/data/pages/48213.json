{"id":48213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count","text":"e=\"preserve\">A count is a nobleman in most of European countries, equivalent in rank to a British earl, whose wife is also still a \"countess\" (for lack of an Anglo-Saxon term). The word \"count\" comes from French \"comte\" which in turn comes from the Latin \"comitas\", \"companion\" (of the emperor). In feudalism the territory ruled by a count was a county.\nA woman having this title or the wife of a count is called countess.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":26},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":46},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":90},{"uri":"Earl","surface_form":"earl","offset":98},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":205},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":286},{"uri":"Feudalism","surface_form":"feudalism","offset":299},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":346}]}
