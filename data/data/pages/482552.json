{"id":482552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The predicate in traditional grammar is the second part of a clause or sentence, the first being the subject. A predicate completes an idea about the subject, such as what it does or what it is like.\nThe predicate provides information about the subject.\nThe subject NP is shown in green, and the predicate VP in blue.\nThere is a quite different theory of sentence structure, called dependency structure grammar. This puts the finite verb (= conjugated verb) as the root of all sentence structure. It rejects the binary NP-VP division.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":42},{"uri":"Clause","surface_form":"clause","offset":74},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":84},{"uri":"Subject_(grammar)","surface_form":"subject","offset":114},{"uri":"Dependency_grammar","surface_form":"dependency structure","offset":395},{"uri":"Finite_verb","surface_form":"finite verb","offset":439}]}
