Yamagata was the founder of the Imperial Japanese Army.\nCareer.\nYamagata was born June 14, 1838 in Hagi. Hagi was the capital of the feudal domain of Ch\u014Dsh\u016B (present-day Yamaguchi prefecture). He was schooled by his father. Yamagata studied classical Japanese and Chinese literature. He learned the martial arts of \"Jujutsu\". Yamagata also learned the military use of the spear and how to fence.\nHe went to \"Shokasonjuku\", a private school run by Yoshida Sh\u014Din. There, he helped overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868. He was a commander in the \"Kiheitai\". This was a semi-military organization created along semi-western lines by the Ch\u014Dsh\u016B domain. He was a staff officer in the Boshin War (1867 to 1868).\nAfter the Tokugawa were overthrown, Yamagata and Saig\u014D Tsugumichi traveled abroad in 1869. They were sent to research the military systems of western countries. Yamagata was impressed with the Prussian military. After a year Yamagata returned and reported directly to Emperor Meiji in Tokyo. He was made \"Assistant Vice Minister of Military Affairs\". He used the military theories of Carl von Clausewitz and Prussian war games to change Japan's army. He became War Minister in 1873. He modernized the Imperial Japanese Army and made it like the Prussian army. He started military conscription in 1873.\nPersonal life.\nYamagata had no children. He adopted a nephew to be his heir. The nephew was Yamagata Isabur\u014D, the second son of his oldest sister. Then, Isabur\u014D became a career bureaucrat, cabinet minister, and head of the civilian administration of Korea. In his later life he enjoyed landscape architecture, poetry and the rituals of the tea ceremony. Yamagata died on February 1, 1922.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Field_Marshal","surface_form":"Field Marshal","offset":6},{"uri":"Imperial_Japanese_Army","surface_form":"Imperial Japanese Army","offset":27},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Japan","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Japan","offset":64},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"found","offset":106},{"uri":"Hagi%2C_Yamaguchi","surface_form":"Hagi","offset":188},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":207},{"uri":"Feudalism","surface_form":"feudal","offset":222},{"uri":"Domain","surface_form":"domain","offset":229},{"uri":"Nagato_Province","surface_form":"Ch\u014Dsh\u016B","offset":239},{"uri":"Yamaguchi_Prefecture","surface_form":"Yamaguchi prefecture","offset":259},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":289},{"uri":"Study","surface_form":"studied","offset":322},{"uri":"Classical","surface_form":"classical","offset":330},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":353},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":361},{"uri":"Martial_arts","surface_form":"martial arts","offset":388},{"uri":"Jujutsu","surface_form":"Jujutsu","offset":405},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":441},{"uri":"Spear","surface_form":"spear","offset":461},{"uri":"Fencing","surface_form":"fence","offset":478},{"uri":"Shokasonjuku","surface_form":"Shokasonjuku","offset":497},{"uri":"Yoshida_Sh%C5%8Din","surface_form":"Yoshida Sh\u014Din","offset":536},{"uri":"Overthrow","surface_form":"overthrow","offset":568},{"uri":"Tokugawa_shogunate","surface_form":"Tokugawa shogunate","offset":582},{"uri":"Commander","surface_form":"commander","offset":619},{"uri":"Kiheitai","surface_form":"Kiheitai","offset":637},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":673},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":756},{"uri":"Boshin_War","surface_form":"Boshin War","offset":771},{"uri":"Tokugawa_shogunate","surface_form":"Tokugawa","offset":808},{"uri":"Saig%C5%8D_Tsugumichi","surface_form":"Saig\u014D Tsugumichi","offset":847},{"uri":"Abroad","surface_form":"abroad","offset":873},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":907},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"western countries","offset":940},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussian military","offset":991},{"uri":"Report","surface_form":"report","offset":1045},{"uri":"Emperor_Meiji","surface_form":"Emperor Meiji","offset":1066},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":1083},{"uri":"Carl_von_Clausewitz","surface_form":"Carl von Clausewitz","offset":1182},{"uri":"Military_exercise","surface_form":"war games","offset":1215},{"uri":"Ministry_of_War_of_Japan","surface_form":"War Minister","offset":1259},{"uri":"Imperial_Japanese_Army","surface_form":"Imperial Japanese Army","offset":1299},{"uri":"Conscription","surface_form":"conscription","offset":1378},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":1431},{"uri":"Nephew","surface_form":"nephew","offset":1454},{"uri":"Heir","surface_form":"heir","offset":1471},{"uri":"Yamagata_Isabur%C5%8D","surface_form":"Yamagata Isabur\u014D","offset":1492},{"uri":"Sister","surface_form":"sister","offset":1539},{"uri":"Bureaucrat","surface_form":"bureaucrat","offset":1577},{"uri":"Cabinet_minister","surface_form":"cabinet minister","offset":1589},{"uri":"Korea_under_Japanese_rule","surface_form":"Korea","offset":1650},{"uri":"Landscape_architecture","surface_form":"landscape architecture","offset":1686},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":1710},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":1725},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":1740},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremony","offset":1744}]}
