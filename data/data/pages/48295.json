This is followed by Corby (53,174), Wellingborough (48,428), Kettering (47,000), Rushden (25,849) and Daventry (22,367). Most of the county's population is concentrated in a central north-south.\nCherwell Edge in Northamptonshire () is near the River Cherwell, north-west of Banbury, England. The once heavily wooded hill and valley was mostly cleared many years ago. The area now also covers the nearby Cherwell Edge Golf Club that was recently built by it too. The golf club is used by various local residents.\nPlaces.\nThese are the main settlements in Northamptonshire with a town charter, a population over 5,000, or otherwise notable.\nTwo major canals - the Oxford and the Grand Union \u2014 join in the county at Braunston.\nA branch of the Grand Union Canal connects to the River Nene in Northampton.\nTwo trunk railway routes, the West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line traverse the county.\nBefore nationalisation of the railways in 1948 and the creation of British Railways, Northamptonshire was home to three of the \"Big Four\" railway companies; the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, London and North Eastern Railway and Great Western Railway. Only the Southern Railway was not represented.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":61},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":79},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":117},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":122},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":138},{"uri":"Warwickshire","surface_form":"Warwickshire","offset":151},{"uri":"Leicestershire","surface_form":"Leicestershire","offset":165},{"uri":"Rutland","surface_form":"Rutland","offset":181},{"uri":"Cambridgeshire","surface_form":"Cambridgeshire","offset":190},{"uri":"County_of_Peterborough","surface_form":"Peterborough","offset":206},{"uri":"Bedfordshire","surface_form":"Bedfordshire","offset":220},{"uri":"Buckinghamshire","surface_form":"Buckinghamshire","offset":234},{"uri":"Milton_Keynes_(borough)","surface_form":"Borough of Milton Keynes","offset":265},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":292},{"uri":"Lincolnshire","surface_form":"Lincolnshire","offset":309},{"uri":"Northampton","surface_form":"Northampton","offset":390},{"uri":"Squire","surface_form":"squire","offset":457},{"uri":"Spire","surface_form":"spire","offset":469},{"uri":"Northampton","surface_form":"Northampton","offset":543},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":604},{"uri":"Corby","surface_form":"Corby","offset":647},{"uri":"Wellingborough","surface_form":"Wellingborough","offset":663},{"uri":"Kettering","surface_form":"Kettering","offset":688},{"uri":"Rushden","surface_form":"Rushden","offset":708},{"uri":"Daventry","surface_form":"Daventry","offset":729},{"uri":"River_Cherwell","surface_form":"River Cherwell","offset":871},{"uri":"Banbury","surface_form":"Banbury","offset":901},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":910},{"uri":"Cherwell_Edge_Golf_Club","surface_form":"Cherwell Edge Golf Club","offset":1030},{"uri":"Golf_club_(institution)","surface_form":"golf club","offset":1093},{"uri":"Oxford_Canal","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":1289},{"uri":"Grand_Union_Canal","surface_form":"Grand Union","offset":1304},{"uri":"Braunston%2C_Northamptonshire","surface_form":"Braunston","offset":1340},{"uri":"River_Nene","surface_form":"River Nene","offset":1401},{"uri":"West_Coast_Main_Line","surface_form":"West Coast Main Line","offset":1458},{"uri":"Midland_Main_Line","surface_form":"Midland Main Line","offset":1487},{"uri":"1948","surface_form":"1948","offset":1568},{"uri":"British_Railways","surface_form":"British Railways","offset":1593},{"uri":"London%2C_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway","surface_form":"London, Midland and Scottish Railway","offset":1687},{"uri":"London_and_North_Eastern_Railway","surface_form":"London and North Eastern Railway","offset":1725},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":1762},{"uri":"Southern_Railway_(England)","surface_form":"Southern Railway","offset":1794}]}
