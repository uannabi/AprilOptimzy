{"id":483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft","text":"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:[http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/msft MSFT]) is a company that makes computer software and video games for users around the world. Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975. Microsoft makes Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office (including Microsoft Word), Edge, MSN and Xbox, among others. Most Microsoft programs cannot be downloaded for free - people have to buy them in a shop or online. Some products (like the Windows operating system) are often already installed when people buy a new computer.\nHardware.\nMicrosoft has also made a wide variety of hardware over the years. Among them are computer accessories like mice, keyboards, and webcams.\nThe company also makes and promotes a video game console, Xbox. It lets people play video games on their televisions. The games were first stored on CDs, but many recent games are downloaded from the Internet. There have been three generations of Xbox. The first generation came out in 2001 and was just called Xbox, while the second, the Xbox 360, was released in 2005. The third and newest model is the Xbox One in May 2013. Beginning with the Xbox 360, Microsoft introduced Xbox Live, which lets people play games online against other people anywhere in the world. The Xbox has become very popular and more than 100 million units have been sold worldwide. Because of this, Microsoft is considered one of the three big companies that make video game consoles, along with Nintendo and Sony.\nMost recently, Microsoft has also started to make its own PCs, called the Surface. The first model was announced in 2012 and the Surface line now includes tablets that use either ARM or Intel processors, two models of laptops called the Surface Book and Surface Laptop, an all-in-one PC called the Surface Studio, and an interactive whiteboard, the Surface Hub.\nIn 2014, Microsoft bought the mobile phone division of Nokia, a Finnish company, which then became Microsoft Mobile. The sale included the Lumia family of smartphones, which use Microsoft's own Windows Phone platform. From 2014 to 2016, Microsoft Mobile also made feature phones with the Nokia brand. Then the feature phone business was sold to HMD global, which continues to produce both feature phones and Android smartphones under license from Nokia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"NASDAQ","surface_form":"NASDAQ","offset":23},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":77},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":105},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":118},{"uri":"Bill_Gates","surface_form":"Bill Gates","offset":158},{"uri":"Paul_Allen","surface_form":"Paul Allen","offset":173},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":229},{"uri":"Microsoft_Office","surface_form":"Microsoft Office","offset":248},{"uri":"Microsoft_Word","surface_form":"Microsoft Word","offset":276},{"uri":"Microsoft_Edge","surface_form":"Edge","offset":293},{"uri":"MSN","surface_form":"MSN","offset":299},{"uri":"Xbox","surface_form":"Xbox","offset":307},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"programs","offset":342},{"uri":"Download","surface_form":"download","offset":361},{"uri":"Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":452},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":460},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":528},{"uri":"Computer_hardware","surface_form":"hardware","offset":590},{"uri":"Computer_mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":656},{"uri":"Computer_keyboard","surface_form":"keyboards","offset":662},{"uri":"Webcam","surface_form":"webcam","offset":677},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game console","offset":724},{"uri":"Xbox","surface_form":"Xbox","offset":744},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":791},{"uri":"Compact_disc","surface_form":"CD","offset":835},{"uri":"Xbox_360","surface_form":"Xbox 360","offset":1025},{"uri":"Xbox_One","surface_form":"Xbox One","offset":1091},{"uri":"Xbox_Live","surface_form":"Xbox Live","offset":1163},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":1459},{"uri":"Sony","surface_form":"Sony","offset":1472},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"PC","offset":1536},{"uri":"Microsoft_Surface","surface_form":"Surface","offset":1552},{"uri":"Tablet_computer","surface_form":"tablets","offset":1633},{"uri":"ARM_architecture","surface_form":"ARM","offset":1657},{"uri":"Intel","surface_form":"Intel","offset":1664},{"uri":"Laptop","surface_form":"laptop","offset":1696},{"uri":"All-in-one_PC","surface_form":"all-in-one PC","offset":1751},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":1870},{"uri":"Nokia","surface_form":"Nokia","offset":1895},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":1904},{"uri":"Microsoft_Mobile","surface_form":"Microsoft Mobile","offset":1939},{"uri":"Microsoft_Lumia","surface_form":"Lumia","offset":1979},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":1995},{"uri":"Feature_phone","surface_form":"feature phone","offset":2104},{"uri":"HMD_global","surface_form":"HMD global","offset":2185},{"uri":"Android_(operating_system)","surface_form":"Android","offset":2248}]}
