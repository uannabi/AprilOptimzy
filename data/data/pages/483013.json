In 1951, as a rookie left fielder for the Chicago White Sox, he became the first black player in White Sox franchise history, and one of the first Latin Americans to be named to a major league All-Star team.\nMi\u00F1oso was found dead in the driver's seat of a car near a gas station in Chicago at 1 am on March 1, 2015, aged 92.
