{"id":483045,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery","text":"=\"preserve\">Gastric bypass surgery is a surgery in which the stomach is divided and the gastrointestinal tract is redirected. The surgery is performed on people who have morbid obesity or have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or other weight-related health problems.\nAs with all surgery, problems may occur. Some people could die after having the surgery.\nGastric bypass surgery can be done using methods that make only small incisions (cuts) into the abdomen. It is one of the most difficult surgeries to perform that way. Advantages of using those methods include that patients don't have to stay in the hospital as long, they have less pain, it doesn't take as long to recover, and the scars are smaller.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":40},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":61},{"uri":"Gastrointestinal_tract","surface_form":"gastrointestinal tract","offset":88},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":177},{"uri":"Type_2_diabetes","surface_form":"type 2 diabetes","offset":193},{"uri":"High_blood_pressure","surface_form":"high blood pressure","offset":210},{"uri":"Abdomen","surface_form":"abdomen","offset":456},{"uri":"Scar","surface_form":"scar","offset":693}]}
