{"id":48314,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl","text":"An Earl (or Jarl) was a title for nobility used by Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians. It originally meant \"chieftain\" and it referred especially to chieftains set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it stopped being used in the Middle Ages, whereas, in Britain, it became synonymous with the continental count.\nIn Anglo-Saxon times the title was similar to that of Ealdorman.\nToday, an earl is a member of the British peerage, and is below a Marquess, but above a Viscount. A British Earl is the same as a continental Count. Since there is no feminine form of Earl, the wife of an Earl has the rank of Countess (the continental equivalent).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"nobility","offset":34},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxons","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxons","offset":51},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":68},{"uri":"Chieftain","surface_form":"chieftain","offset":104},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":244},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":288},{"uri":"Count","surface_form":"count","offset":320},{"uri":"Ealdorman","surface_form":"Ealdorman","offset":381},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":426},{"uri":"Peerage","surface_form":"peerage","offset":434},{"uri":"Marquess","surface_form":"Marquess","offset":458},{"uri":"Viscount","surface_form":"Viscount","offset":480},{"uri":"Count","surface_form":"Count","offset":534},{"uri":"Countess","surface_form":"Countess","offset":618}]}
