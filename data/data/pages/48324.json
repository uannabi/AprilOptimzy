{"id":48324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_lobster","text":"Spiny lobsters, also known as rock lobsters are a family (Palinuridae) of about 45 species of crustaceans, in the Decapoda Reptantia. Spiny lobsters are also called \"crayfish\", \"sea crayfish\" or \"crawfish\".\nAlthough they superficially resemble true lobsters in terms of overall shape, and that they also have a hard carapace and exoskeleton, the two groups are not closely related. Spiny lobsters can be easily distinguished from true lobsters by their very long, thick, spiny antennae, and by their complete lack of claws (\"chelae\"); true lobsters have much smaller antennae and claws on the first three pairs of legs, with the first being particularly enlarged. Like true lobsters, however, spiny lobsters are edible and are an economically significant food source; they are the biggest food export of the Bahamas\u00A0.\nSpiny lobsters are found in almost all warm seas, including the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea, but are particularly common in Australasia, where they are referred to commonly as crayfish or sea crayfish (\"Jasus novaehollandiae\" and \"Jasus edwardsii\"), and South Africa (\"Jasus lalandii\"). A new species, \"Palinurus barbarae\" was described in 2006.\nThe largest spiny lobster on record was over 1\u00A0m (3\u00A0ft) long and weighed over 11.8\u00A0kg (26\u00A0lb).\nSpiny lobsters tend to live in crevices of rocks and coral reefs, only occasionally venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, crabs, sea urchins or carrion to eat. Sometimes, they migrate \"en masse\", in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. Potential predators may be deterred from eating spiny lobsters by a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny lobsters rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton\u00A0. Spiny lobsters usually exhibit social habit by being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones and leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for itself\u00A0.\nThe furry lobsters (\"e.g.\" \"Palinurellus\") are sometimes separated into a family of their own, the Synaxidae, but are usually considered members of the Palinuridae. The slipper lobsters (Scyllaridae) are their next closest relatives, and these two or three families make up the Achelata. Genera of spiny lobsters include \"Palinurus\" and a number of anagrams thereof: \"Panulirus\", \"Linuparus\", \"etc.\" (Palinurus was also a helmsman in Virgil's \u00C6neid.)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":83},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":94},{"uri":"Decapoda","surface_form":"Decapoda","offset":114},{"uri":"Reptantia","surface_form":"Reptantia","offset":123},{"uri":"Crayfish","surface_form":"crayfish","offset":166},{"uri":"Lobster","surface_form":"true lobsters","offset":244},{"uri":"Carapace","surface_form":"carapace","offset":316},{"uri":"Exoskeleton","surface_form":"exoskeleton","offset":329},{"uri":"Antenna_(biology)","surface_form":"antennae","offset":477},{"uri":"Claw","surface_form":"claw","offset":517},{"uri":"Arthropod_leg","surface_form":"legs","offset":614},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":808},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":882},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":900},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":950},{"uri":"Crayfish","surface_form":"crayfish","offset":1002},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1080},{"uri":"Palinurus_barbarae","surface_form":"Palinurus barbarae","offset":1129},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":1219},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"ft","offset":1224},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kg","offset":1255},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"lb","offset":1262},{"uri":"Coral","surface_form":"coral","offset":1320},{"uri":"Reef","surface_form":"reef","offset":1326},{"uri":"Snail","surface_form":"snail","offset":1382},{"uri":"Clam","surface_form":"clam","offset":1390},{"uri":"Crab","surface_form":"crab","offset":1397},{"uri":"Sea_urchin","surface_form":"sea urchin","offset":1404},{"uri":"Carrion","surface_form":"carrion","offset":1419},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":1529},{"uri":"Furry_lobster","surface_form":"furry lobster","offset":1899},{"uri":"Slipper_lobster","surface_form":"slipper lobster","offset":2064},{"uri":"Achelata","surface_form":"Achelata","offset":2173},{"uri":"Palinurus","surface_form":"Palinurus","offset":2296},{"uri":"Virgil","surface_form":"Virgil","offset":2329},{"uri":"%C3%86neid","surface_form":"\u00C6neid","offset":2338}]}
