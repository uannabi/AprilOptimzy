{"id":483316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_green_woodpecker","text":"The European green woodpecker (\"Picus viridis\"), or European green woodpecker, is a member of the woodpecker family Picidae. It occurs in most of Europe and in western Asia. There are four subspecies. All have green upperparts, paler yellowish underparts, and a red crown.\nThe woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on ants on the ground and does not often 'drum' on trees like other woodpecker species. It is a shy bird but usually draws attention with its loud calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19\u201320 days.\nIt gives a loud call known as [http://www.10x50.com/Sound_files/yaffle_w.WAV yaffling].\nOld deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of ants, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, hedges, scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, heaths, plantations, orchards and lawns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Woodpecker","surface_form":"woodpecker","offset":98},{"uri":"Picidae","surface_form":"Picidae","offset":116},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":146},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":168},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":189},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":323},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":658},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":729},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":784},{"uri":"Woodlands","surface_form":"woodlands","offset":806},{"uri":"Hedges","surface_form":"hedges","offset":817},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":855},{"uri":"Floodplain","surface_form":"floodplain","offset":867},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":896},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":926},{"uri":"Heaths","surface_form":"heaths","offset":937},{"uri":"Forestry","surface_form":"plantations","offset":945},{"uri":"Orchard","surface_form":"orchard","offset":958},{"uri":"Lawn","surface_form":"lawn","offset":971}]}
