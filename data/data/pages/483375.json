{"id":483375,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen","text":"The Tuskegee Airmen is the popular name for a group of African-American military pilots (fighter and bomber) who fought in World War II. Formally, they formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. The name also applies to the crew members and support personnel. Their units were all black and all segregated. They had an outstanding record. As fighter escorts they had the reputation that not a single bomber was lost to enemy action while being escorted by Tuskegee airmen.\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces. During World War II, Black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws. Most Tuskegee pilots were trained at Tuskegee Army Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama. Training bomber crews took longer than training fighter pilots and the war was won before they finished. Navigators and other crew members trained at various army based in the US.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Popular_culture","surface_form":"popular","offset":27},{"uri":"Group","surface_form":"group","offset":46},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":55},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":81},{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter","offset":89},{"uri":"Bomber","surface_form":"bomber","offset":101},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":123},{"uri":"Formal","surface_form":"Formal","offset":137},{"uri":"332nd_FG","surface_form":"332nd Fighter Group","offset":163},{"uri":"477th_Fighter_Group","surface_form":"477th Bombardment Group","offset":191},{"uri":"United_States_Army_Air_Forces","surface_form":"United States Army Air Forces","offset":222},{"uri":"Crew","surface_form":"crew","offset":282},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"personnel","offset":307},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black","offset":339},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"segregated","offset":353},{"uri":"Escort_fighter","surface_form":"fighter escorts","offset":400},{"uri":"Reputation","surface_form":"reputation","offset":429},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemy","offset":477},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"aviators","offset":592},{"uri":"United_States_Armed_Forces","surface_form":"United States Armed Forces","offset":608},{"uri":"Jim_Crow_laws","surface_form":"Jim Crow laws","offset":719},{"uri":"Training","surface_form":"trained","offset":760},{"uri":"Sharpe_Field","surface_form":"Tuskegee Army Airfield","offset":771},{"uri":"Tuskegee%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Tuskegee, Alabama","offset":797},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"Navigators","offset":921},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":992}]}
