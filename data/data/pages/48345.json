{"id":48345,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_theory","text":"e=\"preserve\">In\u00A0biology,\u00A0cell theory\u00A0is the historic\u00A0scientific theory, now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of\u00A0cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to\u00A0microscopes\u00A0over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to\u00A0Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as\u00A0cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to\u00A0Matthias Schleiden\u00A0and\u00A0Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like\u00A0Rudolf Virchow\u00A0contributed to the theory.\nBy the mid-century cells were identified as being the substance in a body part containing what's called germs in A cell just like a fungi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cells","surface_form":"Cells","offset":142}]}
