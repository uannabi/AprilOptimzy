{"id":483580,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_(food)","text":"Stock in cooking (cuisine) is a liquid flavoring base for soups and sauces. It is a flavoured liquid preparation, and is the basis of many dishes. The ideas go back to Car\u00EAme, and were simplified by Escoffier.\nA stock is made by simmering animal bones and/or meat, fish, or vegetables in water and/or wine. mirepoix or other aromatics are added for more flavour. Mirepoix is a mixture of onions, carrots, celery, and sometimes other vegetables. Many use ready-made ingredients like Oxo cubes or bouillon cubes. It is possible to make stock more quickly with a pressure cooker.\nFish stock, however, is cooked for only twenty minutes or so.\nStock lasts for three or four days in the fridge, but can be boiled again, and stored again.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":9},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":18},{"uri":"Flavor","surface_form":"flavor","offset":39},{"uri":"Soups","surface_form":"soups","offset":58},{"uri":"Sauces","surface_form":"sauces","offset":68},{"uri":"Dish_(food)","surface_form":"dishes","offset":139},{"uri":"Car%C3%AAme","surface_form":"Car\u00EAme","offset":168},{"uri":"Escoffier","surface_form":"Escoffier","offset":199},{"uri":"Simmering","surface_form":"simmering","offset":229},{"uri":"Mirepoix_(cuisine)","surface_form":"mirepoix","offset":307},{"uri":"Onions","surface_form":"onions","offset":388},{"uri":"Carrots","surface_form":"carrots","offset":396},{"uri":"Celery","surface_form":"celery","offset":405},{"uri":"Vegetables","surface_form":"vegetables","offset":433},{"uri":"Bouillon","surface_form":"bouillon","offset":495},{"uri":"Pressure_cooker","surface_form":"pressure cooker","offset":560}]}
