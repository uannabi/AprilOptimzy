{"id":483656,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gave_de_Pau","text":"The Gave de Pau is a river of south-western France; it is a left tributary of the Adour river.\nIt takes its name from the city Pau, through which it flows. The word gave is a name given to rivers on the mountains in regions of the western Pyrenees; so, Gave de Pau means \"the river of Pau\" or \"the river that flows through Pau\". Many other rivers in the region have the word \"gave\" as part of their names.\nGeography.\nThe Gave de Pau has a length of about, including the \"Gave de Gavarnie\", and a drainage basin with an area of approximately.\nIts average yearly discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is at B\u00E9renx, in the Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Atlantiques department.\nAverage monthly discharge (m3/s) at B\u00E9renx\nCourse.\nThe Gave de Pau starts in the Cirque de Gavarnie, in the \"Parc national des Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es\" (\"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es National Park\"), in the \"commune\" of Gavarnie, Hautes-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es department, at an altitude of about. The upper part of the river is known as \"Gave de Gavarnie\"; the name \"Gave de Pau\" is given to the river after the Gave de Gavarnie joins the Bastan river at Luz-Saint-Sauveur.\nThe Gave de Pau receives its main tributary, the Gave d'Oloron, in Peyrehorade and, from there, it is named as \"Gaves R\u00E9unis\" (United Gaves).
