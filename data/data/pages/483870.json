The group is basically a binary group. The member galaxies are mostly concentrated around either IC 342 or Maffei 1, which are the brightest galaxies in the group.\nThe group, and the Local Group, are in the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Galaxy_group","surface_form":"group of galaxies","offset":98},{"uri":"Local_Group","surface_form":"Local Group","offset":123},{"uri":"IC_342","surface_form":"IC 342","offset":233},{"uri":"Maffei_1","surface_form":"Maffei 1","offset":243},{"uri":"Virgo_Supercluster","surface_form":"Virgo Supercluster","offset":343},{"uri":"Local_Supercluster","surface_form":"Local Supercluster","offset":372}]}
