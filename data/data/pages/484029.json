In other words, oxides which neither react with acids or with bases are called neutral. Neutral oxides are often misconceptioned as amphoteric oxides but both of them have different characteristics.\nList of Neutral oxides.\n1) Nitrous oxide (N2O)\n2) Nitric oxide (NO)\n3) Carbon monoxide (CO)\n5) Manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2)\nThere are 7 neutral oxides discovered till date.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acidic","surface_form":"acidic","offset":56},{"uri":"Basic_(chemistry)","surface_form":"basic","offset":67},{"uri":"Amphoteric_oxide","surface_form":"amphoteric oxide","offset":206},{"uri":"Nitrous_oxide","surface_form":"Nitrous oxide","offset":300},{"uri":"Nitric_oxide","surface_form":"Nitric oxide","offset":323},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"Carbon monoxide","offset":344},{"uri":"Manganese(IV)_oxide","surface_form":"Manganese(IV) oxide","offset":368}]}
