{"id":4841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_paradox","text":"If either outcome were considered true, then it is argued that God Almighty is actually not almighty.\nAnswers to the God Paradox.\nThe God paradox is a good example of a philosophical problem. This section has some answers to this paradox.\nOne answer is that God could make it so he can't lift the mountain by his own choice. In other words, God can lift the unliftable mountain because he is all powerful, but he chooses not to be able to, and so he chooses to cut his own power, because he is able. God can also choose to not be able to create such a mountain. God is all powerful, so he can choose not to have the power to make an unliftable mountain. Simply said, God can cut his own power, but in so doing, he can still regain that power. It is a limbo, a state between not powerful and powerful, something that is not definable by our knowledge of what is possible or impossible. Because God is almighty, he surpasses our definitions of what he can and cannot do.\nGod cannot.\nThis answer says God is able to do only things less than God. If you say there exists a mountain that is \"heavier than anybody is able to lift,\" then what you say is funny: it means nothing, because God is able to lift any mountain. This is because saying a mountain is \"too heavy to lift\" means this mountain cannot be lifted by anybody. This does not mean that God is too weak to lift very heavy mountains. God cannot lift an \"unliftable\" mountain because that would not make sense. He also cannot create an \"unliftable\" mountain because that also would not make sense, if God can lift everything. God could still lift any mountain that is not defined as \"cannot be lifted.\" For example, God can make a mountain as heavy as he wants, but he cannot make a round square.\nLogic.\nIn logic, problems can often be solved by breaking them into smaller pieces. One solves each of the small problems.\nThe conclusion is that the statement \"God can do anything\" needs to be qualified. By this logic God cannot do both of two things that are mutually contradictory. C. S. Lewis says that logical contradictions are not a \"thing\". Rather they are nonsense. The question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, \"God can\" before it.\nGod can.\nSome people think, \"Yes, God is able to do things that make Him not able.\" They think God is able to do things that are funny to think, \"Because\", they say, \"there is nothing God is not able to do.\" (See Gospel of Matthew 19:26) However other Bible verses mention things that God cannot do. Hebrews 6:16 says that God cannot lie. Malachi 3:6 says that God cannot change. James 1:3 says that God cannot be tempted by sin.\nSome have suggested that God can do things that defy conventional logic. If He lives in other dimensions a different logic may apply. Some say that God cannot make a square circle. This is true in a two dimensional world. However, a cylinder can be a square viewed from the side and a circle viewed from the top. Likewise, a triangle can have three angles that add to more that 180 degrees. This is possible only on a three dimensional surface like a sphere. It can't be done on a two dimensional plane. (Plane geometry). Addition of an additional dimension changes the logic.\nGod is infinite.\nGod is beyond limitation. His strength is infinite. If He chooses to create a mountain that is too heavy for Him to lift he would simultaneously become strong enough to lift it (which actually means he's not omnipotent, because if he can gradually become stronger, then he can't be all powerful). To ask if the creation of such a mountain is possible is to attempt putting a limitation on the limitless.\nJob.\n'Who is this that darkens council by words without knowledge?..where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?' (Job chapter 38, 1-4)\nIn other words, God's powers are beyond human understanding, as human reason itself is part of God's creation in the Book of Genesis.\nFurther reading.\nThese references may not be simple to understand.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophical problem","offset":169},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"defined","offset":1627},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":1744},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":1762},{"uri":"C._S._Lewis","surface_form":"C.
