Camus was born in Algeria, a country in North Africa. He had French parents. Camus was an existentialist philosopher. Existentialism is a philosophy that is very different from other ways of thinking. Camus won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957.\nHe was the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, and the first African-born writer to receive the award. He is the shortest-lived of any Nobel literature laureate to date, having died in an automobile accident just over two years after receiving the award.\nEarly years.\nAlbert Camus was born in Algeria to a poor working-class family. His mother was Spanish and his father was French. His father died in battle and he was left to live with his grandmother. When he was 17 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which was very impactful on him at that point in his life. It limited him greatly in his athletics as well as in his career opportunities, due to the fact that tuberculosis is quite contagious. For this reason he claimed that his disease \u201Cset him free\u201D because he would have done something else with his life had he seen the opportunity. He went to the University of Algiers, where he graduated with a degree in 1935. In the 1930s, Camus became interested in politics. In 1935, Camus joined the French Communist Party, a political group. In the late 1930s, Camus was a writer for the socialist newspaper, the \"Alger-Republicain\".\n1940s.\nIn 1941, Camus wrote his first novel, which was called \"The Stranger\". During World War II, Camus joined the French Resistance to fight against the Nazi army. After World War II, Camus became friends with another writer named Jean-Paul Sartre. Camus and Sartre often talked about philosophy and politics in small restaurants called caf\u00E9s.\n1950s.\nCamus wrote books about philosophy (ways of thinking) which said that life was \"absurd\" (makes no sense, or has no meaning). In the 1950s Camus tried to improve human rights. In 1960, Camus died in a car crash. He had two children, Catherine and Jean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["philosopher"],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":54},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":61},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":77},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":97},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"plays","offset":108},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":133},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":144},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":155},{"uri":"Existentialism","surface_form":"existentialist","offset":205},{"uri":"Existentialism","surface_form":"Existentialism","offset":233},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":253},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Literature","offset":330},{"uri":"Rudyard_Kipling","surface_form":"Rudyard Kipling","offset":442},{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automobile","offset":600},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":705},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":904},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":1377},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"Communist","offset":1420},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"Party","offset":1430},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":1439},{"uri":"Socialist","surface_form":"socialist","offset":1502},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":1512},{"uri":"The_Stranger","surface_form":"The Stranger","offset":1611},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1633},{"uri":"French_Resistance","surface_form":"French Resistance","offset":1664},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":1703},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":1708},{"uri":"Jean-Paul_Sartre","surface_form":"Jean-Paul Sartre","offset":1781},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":1868},{"uri":"Caf%C3%A9","surface_form":"caf\u00E9","offset":1887}]}
