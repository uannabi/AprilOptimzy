{"id":48417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spine","text":"The spine is a column of vertebrae in the back part of the torso (upper body). It is also called the backbone or vertebral column. There is a spinal canal that runs through the length of the spine. Inside this canal is the spinal cord. Animals that have a spine are called vertebrates, and animals that do not have one are called invertebrates. Humans have a spine, so we are vertebrates. Many vertebrates, including mammals, have intervertebral discs separating the vertebrae.\nSpinal canal.\nThe spinal column has an opening called spinal canal and this opening is used for nerves. The part of the central nervous system in the spinal column is called spinal cord.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Column","surface_form":"column","offset":15},{"uri":"Vertebra","surface_form":"vertebra","offset":25},{"uri":"Torso","surface_form":"torso","offset":59},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":223},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":273},{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":330},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":417},{"uri":"Intervertebral_disc","surface_form":"intervertebral disc","offset":431},{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerves","offset":574},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":598},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":652}]}
