{"id":484170,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex","text":"=\"preserve\">The circumflex is a diacritic (accent) used in French and a few other languages. It is like a little hat on top of a vowel. Originally, it was an \"acute accent\" and a \"grave accent\" put together.\nIn French, the circumflex usually shows the loss of letter, usually the loss of the letter s. Example: maistre (Middle French) > ma\u00EEtre (modern French). Here its function is historical.\nAlso, less often, the circumflex is used to distinguish between homophones. These are words spelt the same, but with different meanings. Example: \"sur\" = on, but \"s\u00FBr\" = safe or certain. In those cases the pronunciation of the two words may be different.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diacritic","surface_form":"diacritic","offset":32},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":59},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":129},{"uri":"Acute_accent","surface_form":"acute accent","offset":159},{"uri":"Grave_accent","surface_form":"grave accent","offset":180},{"uri":"Homophone","surface_form":"homophone","offset":458},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":600}]}
