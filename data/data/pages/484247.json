{"id":484247,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_Tower_of_Terror","text":"The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, commonly known as Tower of Terror, is a classic Disney amusement park attraction. The ride is an elevator that drops and rises several times. It is like riding an elevator that fails while people are on it. The theme of the ride is based\nLocations.\nThere are currently four versions. Three are based on the TV show \"The Twilight Zone\".\nThe ride.\n\"Guests\" get on what appears to be an old \"freight elevator\". The elevator car goes past several old hallways. It passes what appear to be ghosts of former guests. Next the ride enters a dark vertical shaft. Suddenly the elevator snaps upward and with the sounds and sparks of the elevator cables breaking it plunges downward. It freefalls 13 floors down before stopping. Then it climbs, stops, falls again and repeats the process. People outside the ride can hear the riders screaming in terror. The ride attracts thrill-seekers who ride again and again. Each time the ride is a little different.\nRestrictions.\nPeople must be at least 40 inches (102\u00A0cm) tall to enter the ride. Wheelchairs and mobility scooters must be left behind (users must be strong enough to stand). Anyone suffering from neck, back, or heart problems, motion sickness or claustrophobia are advised not to ride. Pregnant women may not ride. Anyone with a fear of heights or fear of falling may want to avoid this ride as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classic","surface_form":"classic","offset":75},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":83},{"uri":"Theme_park","surface_form":"amusement park","offset":90},{"uri":"Elevator","surface_form":"elevator","offset":132},{"uri":"Television_program","surface_form":"TV show","offset":342},{"uri":"The_Twilight_Zone","surface_form":"The Twilight Zone","offset":351},{"uri":"Elevator","surface_form":"freight elevator","offset":424},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":520},{"uri":"Upward","surface_form":"upward","offset":617},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":637},{"uri":"Spark","surface_form":"spark","offset":648},{"uri":"Wire_rope","surface_form":"elevator cables","offset":662},{"uri":"Freefall","surface_form":"freefall","offset":711},{"uri":"Floor","surface_form":"floor","offset":724},{"uri":"Screaming","surface_form":"screaming","offset":857},{"uri":"Terror","surface_form":"terror","offset":870},{"uri":"Adventure","surface_form":"thrill-seekers","offset":896},{"uri":"Wheelchair","surface_form":"Wheelchair","offset":1060},{"uri":"Mobility_scooter","surface_form":"mobility scooter","offset":1076},{"uri":"Neck","surface_form":"neck","offset":1176},{"uri":"Back","surface_form":"back","offset":1182},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":1191},{"uri":"Motion_sickness","surface_form":"motion sickness","offset":1207},{"uri":"Claustrophobia","surface_form":"claustrophobia","offset":1226},{"uri":"Pregnant","surface_form":"Pregnant","offset":1266},{"uri":"Acrophobia","surface_form":"fear of heights","offset":1309},{"uri":"Fear_of_falling","surface_form":"fear of falling","offset":1328}]}
