{"id":4843,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism","text":"Libertarianism is a view in politics and philosophy that focuses on liberty. Libertarianism says that it is usually better to give people more free choice. It also says that the government should have less control over people. There are different kinds of libertarianism in both left-wing and right-wing politics.\nLibertarianism grew out of liberalism as a movement in the 1800s. Many of the beliefs of libertarianism are similar to the beliefs in classical liberalism. It also has roots in anarchism and the Austrian School of economics.\nIndividual rights.\nLibertarians believe that no person can justly own or control the body of another person, what they call \u2018self-ownership\u2019 or \u2019individual sovereignty.\u2019 In simple words, every person has a right to control her or his own body.\nIn the 19th century, United States libertarians like William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and Lysander Spooner were all abolitionists. Abolitionists were people who wanted to end slavery right away.\nGarrison based his opposition to slavery on the idea of self-ownership. Since you have a natural right to control your own body, no one else has any right to steal that control from you. Garrison and Douglass both called slave masters \u2018man stealers.\u2019\nStopping violence.\nIf you have a right to control your own body, then no one has a right to start violence (or force) against you.\nSome libertarians believe that all violence is unjust. These libertarians are often called \"anarcho-pacifists\". Robert LeFevre was a libertarian who rejected all violence. However, most libertarians believe that there are some ways violence can be justified.\nOne thing that justifies violence is self defense. If someone is violent towards you, you have a right to defend yourself with equal force.\nThe libertarian Murray N. Rothbard said that it would be wrong to kill someone for stealing a pack of gum. If you steal gum, this is an act of violence against the property owner. The owner has a right to use defensive violence to get the gum back, but killing the thief goes too far. That is too much force because it is not equal to the force used by the thief. Punishment must be equal to the crime. A student and colleague of his, Walter Block, said that a punishment should not be equal to the crime, but rather enough to make up for the damage the crime caused plus how much it cost to catch the criminal.\nSome libertarians believe that it is your moral duty to defend yourself and your property if you can. This belief is usually held by Objectivists. These people believe that pacifism is immoral. Most libertarians disagree with this view.\nAll libertarians believe that it is wrong to start violence against any person or against what he or she owns. They call this the \"non-aggression principle.\"\nProperty.\nOwnership is the right to control something. Property is the thing that you control.\nLibertarians believe that property rights come from self-ownership. This means that because you have a right to control your own body, you also have a right to control what you make with it.\nThe English philosopher John Locke said that a person comes to own something by using it. So, if you turn an area that no-one else owns into a farm and use it, that area becomes your property. This is called the \"homestead principle.\"\nLibertarians also say that you can become a legitimate owner by receiving something as a gift or by trading it with someone for something they own. You do not become a legitimate owner by stealing. You also do not become a legitimate owner by simply \"saying\" you own something. If you have not \"homesteaded\" the thing or received it through trade or gift, you do not own it.\nGovernment.\nLibertarians are opposed to states (or governments) creating any \"laws\" that tell people what they can and cannot do with their own bodies. The only legitimate laws are laws that say a person may not start violence against other people or their legitimate property. All \"laws\" stopping people from doing nonviolent things should be repealed, according to libertarians. (These \"laws\" are usually called \"victimless crimes\" because there is no victim if there is no harm.)\nIn most countries, the state (or government) takes tax money from the people. All libertarians support cutting taxes back, and some libertarians believe the state should not take tax money at all. Libertarians think people can take care of the poor without the government. They believe that people should pay for the things that they want to use, but not have to pay for other things that they do not want. Tax evasion (refusal to pay taxes to the state) is a victimless crime. Libertarians would prefer to see taxation replaced with lotteries, user fees, and endowments.\nLibertarians think everyone should be allowed to decide what is good or bad for her/his own body. Libertarians think if people want to drive cars without wearing seat belts, it is their own choice. They should not be forcibly stopped from doing that, not even by the state. If a person wants to donate all of her/his money to a charity, or waste it all gambling, that is also something she/he should decide for herself/himself. No one should be forcibly stopped from doing that, not even by the state. Libertarians even say that if adults want to use harmful drugs, they should be allowed to do that, even if it spoils their lives. It is the drug user's own choice because it is the drug user's own body. As long as the drug user does not start using violence against other people or their legitimate property, no one should use violence against the drug user or the drug user's legitimate property, not even the government.\nMany libertarians also believe that families and friends should look after people so that they will not use drugs, drive without seat belts, or do other things that are dangerous for them. But no one can force others to do things that they do not want to do, or to stop them from doing nonviolent things that they want to do.\nTypes of Libertarians.\nThere are two broad basic types of libertarians.\nMinarchism.\nMinarchists are libertarians who believe that society should have a state with very limited power. They believe that free markets are the most moral and efficient way of providing goods and services. They typically believe that the only things the state should provide are police and judges to make sure that people obey the laws, and a military to make sure that no one attacks the country. Some minarchists believe in having a small amount of taxation and limited provision of public goods such as international diplomacy and public parks.\nTwo famous minarchist libertarians are Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand. Nozick believed that the only legitimate thing a state can do is have a police force. He called his legitimate state a \"night-watchman state.\" Ayn Rand believed that the state should have a police force and a court system.\nAnarchism.\nLibertarian anarchists usually call themselves anarcho-capitalists, free-market anarchists, individualist anarchists, or just anarchists.\nLibertarian anarchists do not believe the state is needed. They believe that people can organise their own lives and businesses. They want to replace the state with voluntary organisations, including charities, private companies, voluntary unions, and mutual aid societies. They also want to end all forced taxation.\nThey say that state police can be replaced with \"DROs\" (Dispute Resolution Organisations) or \"private protection agencies.\" They also say that state judges can be replaced with \"private arbitration.\"\nA famous libertarian anarchist thinker was Murray N. Rothbard. Others include Lysander Spooner, Benjamin R. Tucker, and Linda & Morris Tannehill.\nOther types.\nMost libertarians fall under one of the two types of libertarians listed above. But there are other types, too.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosophy_(view)","surface_form":"view in politics and philosophy","offset":20},{"uri":"Liberty","surface_form":"liberty","offset":68},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":178},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":279},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":293},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberalism","offset":341},{"uri":"Classical_liberalism","surface_form":"classical liberalism","offset":448},{"uri":"Anarchism","surface_form":"anarchism","offset":491},{"uri":"Austrian_School","surface_form":"Austrian School","offset":509},{"uri":"Self-ownership","surface_form":"self-ownership","offset":664},{"uri":"Sovereignty","surface_form":"sovereignty","offset":695},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":804},{"uri":"William_Lloyd_Garrison","surface_form":"William Lloyd Garrison","offset":836},{"uri":"Frederick_Douglass","surface_form":"Frederick Douglass","offset":860},{"uri":"Lysander_Spooner","surface_form":"Lysander Spooner","offset":884},{"uri":"Abolitionism","surface_form":"abolitionists","offset":910},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":1338},{"uri":"Robert_LeFevre","surface_form":"Robert LeFevre","offset":1483},{"uri":"Self_defense","surface_form":"self defense","offset":1667},{"uri":"Murray_N._Rothbard","surface_form":"Murray N.
