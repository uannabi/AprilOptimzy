{"id":484399,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station","text":"A television station is a commercial business or organization that transmits their signals directly to television receivers (TV sets). It usually has a studio for making TV show<nowiki/>s. Television transmissions can be broadcast using analog television signals or digital television signals. Broadcast television standards are set by the government. These standards vary around the world. Analog television stations usually broadcast their signals on one television channel. Digital television stations broadcast their signals over one or more subchannels.\nThe term \"television station\" is normally applied to earth-based television stations and not to cable television or satellite television broadcasting. Television stations usually require a broadcast license from a government agency. That agency sets the rules which television stations must follow. In the United States, for example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licenses television channels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commercial business","offset":26},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":49},{"uri":"Broadcasting","surface_form":"transmit","offset":67},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television receivers","offset":103},{"uri":"Studio","surface_form":"studio","offset":152},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"TV show","offset":170},{"uri":"Broadcasting","surface_form":"broadcast","offset":221},{"uri":"Analog_television","surface_form":"analog television","offset":237},{"uri":"Digital_television","surface_form":"digital television","offset":266},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":315},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":340},{"uri":"Television_channel","surface_form":"television channel","offset":457},{"uri":"Digital_television","surface_form":"Digital television","offset":477},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":612},{"uri":"Cable_television","surface_form":"cable television","offset":655},{"uri":"Satellite_television","surface_form":"satellite television","offset":675},{"uri":"Broadcast_license","surface_form":"broadcast license","offset":748},{"uri":"Government_agency","surface_form":"government agency","offset":773},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":813},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":865},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":884},{"uri":"Federal_Communications_Commission","surface_form":"Federal Communications Commission","offset":897}]}
