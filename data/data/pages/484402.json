{"id":484402,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg_Palace","text":"The Luxembourg Palace (known in French as the \"Palais du Luxembourg\") is a former royal palace in Paris, France. Since 1958 it has been the seat of the French Senate of the Fifth Republic.\nBrief history.\nThe palace was originally built in 1612 by Marie de' Medici on lands she owned. The design was based on buildings from her native Florence. The building is often compared to the far larger Palazzo Pitti where Queen Marie was born in 1575. In 1642, Marie left the Luxembourg to her second and favourite son, Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans. He called it the \"Palais d'Orl\u00E9ans\" but it was still known by its original name. Upon Gaston's death, the palace passed to his widow, Marguerite of Lorraine. Then it passed to his elder daughter by his first marriage, La Grande Mademoiselle.\nIn 1660, Anne de Montpensier sold the Luxembourg to her younger half-sister, \u00C9lisabeth Marguerite d'Orl\u00E9ans, Duchess of Guise. The Duchess, in turn, gave it to her cousin, king Louis XIV, in 1694. In 1717 Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans, Regent of France gave the palace to his favourite daughter the Duchess of Berry. The building became infamous for the duchess's parties and sexual activities. She also hosted Peter the great there in 1717.\nSometime after the French Revolution it became a prison. During World War II it was a headquarters for the Luftwaffe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":98},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":105},{"uri":"Marie_de%27_Medici","surface_form":"Marie de' Medici","offset":247},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":288},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":308},{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":334},{"uri":"Palazzo_Pitti","surface_form":"Palazzo Pitti","offset":393},{"uri":"Gaston%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":511},{"uri":"La_Grande_Mademoiselle","surface_form":"La Grande Mademoiselle","offset":754},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":955},{"uri":"Philippe%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Regent_of_France","surface_form":"Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans, Regent of France","offset":983},{"uri":"Infamous","surface_form":"infamous","offset":1111},{"uri":"Host","surface_form":"host","offset":1178},{"uri":"Peter_the_great","surface_form":"Peter the great","offset":1185},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":1235},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":1265},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1280},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":1302},{"uri":"Luftwaffe","surface_form":"Luftwaffe","offset":1323}]}
