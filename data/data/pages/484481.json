During World War II Schwerte housed a branch of the Buchenwald concentration camp. The camp held 710 prisoners.\nControversy.\nIn 2015 Schwerte officials have proposed housing refugees at the site of the former concentration camp. The plan has been criticized as a bad idea by many Germans including the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia. Officials say the buildings were built after the war and should not be a problem. Refugees coming to Germany include those from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Kosovo and Serbia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":14},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":22},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":46},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":123},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":136},{"uri":"Sauerland","surface_form":"Sauerland","offset":148},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":158},{"uri":"Ruhr_(river)","surface_form":"Ruhr river","offset":170},{"uri":"Cycling","surface_form":"cycling","offset":240},{"uri":"Destination","surface_form":"destination","offset":248},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":264},{"uri":"Civil_and_political_rights","surface_form":"civic rights","offset":301},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":321},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":358},{"uri":"Hanseatic_League","surface_form":"Hanseatic League","offset":367},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":392},{"uri":"Buchenwald_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Buchenwald concentration camp","offset":437},{"uri":"Prisoner","surface_form":"prisoner","offset":486},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":527},{"uri":"Refugee","surface_form":"refugee","offset":559},{"uri":"Concentration_camp","surface_form":"concentration camp","offset":594},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germans","offset":665},{"uri":"Premier","surface_form":"premier","offset":687},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":740},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":850},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":857},{"uri":"Eritrea","surface_form":"Eritrea","offset":870},{"uri":"Kosovo","surface_form":"Kosovo","offset":879},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":890}]}
