{"id":484484,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridia","text":"The Clostridia are a class of Firmicutes, including \"Clostridium\" and other similar genera.\nThe Clostridia are obligate anaerobes. They lack aerobic respiration, and oxygen is toxic to them. Species of the genus \"Clostridium\" are all Gram-positive and can form spores.\nStudies show they are not a monophyletic group. In fact, they are highly polyphyletic. Their relationships are not certain. Most are put in the Clostridiales, but is not a natural group. It is likely to be redefined in the future.\nMost species of the genus \"Clostridium\" are saprophytic organisms found in many places, most notably the soil. However, the genus does contain some human pathogens.\nThe toxins produced by some members of the \"Clostridium\" genus are among the most dangerous known. Examples are tetanus toxin (known as tetanospasmin) produced by \"C. tetani\" and botulinum toxin produced by \"C. botulinum\".\nHeliobacteria are also members of the class Clostridia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Firmicutes","surface_form":"Firmicutes","offset":30},{"uri":"Clostridium","surface_form":"Clostridium","offset":53},{"uri":"Obligate_anaerobe","surface_form":"obligate anaerobe","offset":111},{"uri":"Aerobic_respiration","surface_form":"aerobic respiration","offset":141},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":166},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":176},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"Species","offset":191},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":206},{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"Gram-positive","offset":234},{"uri":"Spores","surface_form":"spores","offset":261},{"uri":"Monophyly","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":297},{"uri":"Polyphyletic","surface_form":"polyphyletic","offset":342},{"uri":"Saprophyte","surface_form":"saprophytic","offset":544},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":605},{"uri":"Pathogens","surface_form":"pathogens","offset":654},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":669},{"uri":"Tetanus","surface_form":"tetanus","offset":777},{"uri":"Tetanospasmin","surface_form":"tetanospasmin","offset":801},{"uri":"Botulinum","surface_form":"botulinum","offset":844},{"uri":"Heliobacteria","surface_form":"Heliobacteria","offset":888}]}
