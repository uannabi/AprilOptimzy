The Ruhr became a center for business and industry. Beginning in the mid 14th century coal was mined along the Ruhr. It became a center for coal and steel production in Germany for over 200 years. In the mid 20th century coal and steel industries came to an end. The buildings were then used for cultural events and entertainment purposes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":14},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":23},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":31},{"uri":"Rhine_River","surface_form":"Rhine River","offset":58},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":108},{"uri":"Winterberg","surface_form":"Winterberg","offset":116},{"uri":"D%C3%BCsseldorf","surface_form":"D\u00FCsseldorf","offset":163},{"uri":"Sauerland","surface_form":"Sauerland","offset":204},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":214},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":244},{"uri":"Arnsberg","surface_form":"Arnsberg","offset":307},{"uri":"Iserlohn","surface_form":"Iserlohn","offset":317},{"uri":"Schwerte","surface_form":"Schwerte","offset":327},{"uri":"Bochum","surface_form":"Bochum","offset":337},{"uri":"Essen","surface_form":"Essen","offset":348},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":367},{"uri":"Hanseatic_league","surface_form":"Hanseatic league","offset":411},{"uri":"Middle_ages","surface_form":"middle ages","offset":439},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":481},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":494},{"uri":"14th_century","surface_form":"14th century","offset":525},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":538},{"uri":"Steel_mill","surface_form":"steel production","offset":601},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":660},{"uri":"Cultural_center","surface_form":"cultural events","offset":748},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":768}]}
