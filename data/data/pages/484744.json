It\u00A0tells the story of a 12-year-old girl, Abilene Tucker, who finds some secrets that start to put together the story of her father\u2019s upbringing.\nVanderpool originally got the idea for \"Navigating Early\" (published 2013) from one of her mother\u2019s dreams. In the dream, there was a boy who was amazing at piano. Although he never had any lessons, he could hear a difficult piece just once and would be able to play it perfectly. From the dream, she created the book about a boy who had an unexplainable gift, that creates a close friendship with a girl. \u201CWhere an author gets her ideas is simple. Ideas come from watching, listening, paying attention, and most of all from the characters themselves.\u201D - Clare Vanderpool.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Newbery_Medal","surface_form":"Newbery Medal","offset":115},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":178},{"uri":"Wichita%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Wichita, Kansas","offset":236},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dream","offset":793}]}
