{"id":484762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Danziger","text":"e=\"preserve\">Paula Danziger (August 18, 1944-July 8, 2004) was an American author of children's and young adult literature.\nPersonal life.\nDanziger was born in Washington, D.C. to Samuel and Carolyn Danziger. Though she struggled in school as a child, she attended Montclair State University in New Jersey and earned a degree in 1967. She was a middle school teacher in New Jersey from 1967-1978 while studying for a Master's degree. Her studies were interrupted when she was in a car crash, where a drunk driver hit her car, and she slammed her head against the front window which caused her to have brain damage. In 1978 she left teaching to write full-time.\nAlthough readers loved her books because of the humor, some critics called them superficial and generic. Others praised her work for tackling real-life issues.\nDanziger died in 2004 after complications from a heart attack. She was 59.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":66},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":112},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":160},{"uri":"Montclair_State_University","surface_form":"Montclair State University","offset":265},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":295},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"Master's degree","offset":417},{"uri":"Myocardial_infarction","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":870}]}
