That means between about. Many thermophiles are archaea. Thermophilic eubacteria may have been among the earliest bacteria.\nThermophiles are found in various geothermally heated parts of the Earth's surface. Examples are hot springs like those in Yellowstone National Park and deep sea hydrothermal vents. Also decaying plant matter, such as peat bogs and compost, makes higher temperatures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extremophile","surface_form":"extremophile","offset":41},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":150},{"uri":"Eubacteria","surface_form":"eubacteria","offset":172},{"uri":"Geothermal_energy","surface_form":"geothermally","offset":260},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":293},{"uri":"Hot_spring","surface_form":"hot spring","offset":323},{"uri":"Yellowstone_National_Park","surface_form":"Yellowstone National Park","offset":349},{"uri":"Hydrothermal_vent","surface_form":"hydrothermal vent","offset":388},{"uri":"Peat","surface_form":"peat","offset":444},{"uri":"Bog","surface_form":"bog","offset":449},{"uri":"Compost","surface_form":"compost","offset":458}]}
