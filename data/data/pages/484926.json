The cells are coccoid which means that they look like a circle or sphere. Most of the species are facultatively anaerobic. They are halotolerant to halophilic.\n\"Jeotgalicoccus\" is named after the Korean fish sauce jeotgal from whence these bacteria were first isolated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":22},{"uri":"Gram-positive","surface_form":"gram-positive","offset":31},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":45},{"uri":"Coccus","surface_form":"coccoid","offset":69},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":141},{"uri":"Anaerobic_organism","surface_form":"facultatively anaerobic","offset":153},{"uri":"Halophile","surface_form":"halotolerant","offset":187},{"uri":"Halophile","surface_form":"halophilic","offset":203},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":251},{"uri":"Fish_sauce","surface_form":"fish sauce","offset":258},{"uri":"Jeotgal","surface_form":"jeotgal","offset":269}]}
