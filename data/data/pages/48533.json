{"id":48533,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries","text":"French fries (called chips in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth, French fried potatoes or just fries in North America), are a type of food made out of potatoes that originated in Belgium. The potatoes are cut into thin strips and fried in oil. In the UK \"chips\" are seen as different to \"fries\" with chips being thicker cut than the thinner fries.\nThey are usually eaten with fish, burgers, sausages, pies, fried chicken, or by themselves. Many things can be put on them to make them taste better, such as salt and vinegar, gravy, curry, cheese, ketchup or mayonnaise. These extra flavours are called condiments.\nIn the UK, a \"chip shop\" is a shop which sells cooked chips, usually to take home to eat. They also sell fried fish, sausages, pies, pickled eggs and pickled onions. Fish and chips is a very popular meal in Great Britain, and other places. American style burger take-aways, such as McDonald's, sell the thinner fries rather than chips.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":34},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":50},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":62},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":115},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":145},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":162},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":190},{"uri":"Frying","surface_form":"fried","offset":241},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":250},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":387},{"uri":"Hamburger","surface_form":"burgers","offset":393},{"uri":"Sausages","surface_form":"sausages","offset":402},{"uri":"Pie","surface_form":"pie","offset":412},{"uri":"Fried_chicken","surface_form":"fried chicken","offset":418},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":517},{"uri":"Vinegar","surface_form":"vinegar","offset":526},{"uri":"Gravy","surface_form":"gravy","offset":535},{"uri":"Curry","surface_form":"curry","offset":542},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":549},{"uri":"Ketchup","surface_form":"ketchup","offset":557},{"uri":"Mayonnaise","surface_form":"mayonnaise","offset":568},{"uri":"Condiment","surface_form":"condiment","offset":612},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"sausage","offset":741},{"uri":"Pies","surface_form":"pies","offset":751},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"pickled eggs","offset":757},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"pickled onions","offset":774},{"uri":"Fish_and_chips","surface_form":"Fish and chips","offset":790},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":831},{"uri":"Take-out","surface_form":"take-aways","offset":886},{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":906}]}
