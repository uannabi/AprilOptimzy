{"id":48585,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum","text":"A flagellum (plural: \"flagella\") is a long, whip-like structure that helps some single celled organisms move. It is composed of microtubules. They help propel cells and organisms in a whip-like motion. The flagellum of eukaryotes usually moves with an \u201CS\u201D motion, and is surrounded by cell membrane.\nFlagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller Cilia. So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum \"Undulipodia\". Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum \"Ciliophora\". Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.\nCilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microtubule","surface_form":"microtubule","offset":128},{"uri":"Propulsion","surface_form":"propel","offset":152},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":169},{"uri":"Whip","surface_form":"whip","offset":184},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":219},{"uri":"Cell_membrane","surface_form":"cell membrane","offset":285},{"uri":"Cilia","surface_form":"Cilia","offset":365},{"uri":"Protist","surface_form":"protist","offset":409},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"Phylum","offset":458},{"uri":"Ciliate","surface_form":"Ciliate","offset":523},{"uri":"Organelle","surface_form":"organelle","offset":780},{"uri":"Mitochondria","surface_form":"mitochondria","offset":855},{"uri":"Plastid","surface_form":"plastid","offset":872},{"uri":"Prokaryote","surface_form":"prokaryote","offset":980},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":993},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":1005},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":1028}]}
