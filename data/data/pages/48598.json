{"id":48598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4","text":"e=\"preserve\">MPEG-4 is a video and audio standard (type). Movies in MPEG-4 need less space on a computer. At the same time, they still have DVD quality. MPEG means Moving Picture Experts Group. Many researchers and engineers all over the world worked to develop MPEG-4. The work on this standard ended in 1998. MPEG-4 became a standard all over the world.\nMovies that use MPEG-4 standard are high quality and take up less computer memory. Older standards were MPEG-1 and MPEG-2. Compared to these older versions, MPEG-4 has more features. For example, it has a way to fix problems, lots of quality and size choices, and a better picture quality.\nMPEG-4 is designed for the special needs of computers, television areas and telecommunications. It is able to be individual objects in a certain area, besides rectangular pieces of computer information. For example, this could be a car driving in front of a background. The background does not change. The car can be treated as separate thing, because it is not a fixed background. This is because MPEG-4 can be many rectangular images at the same time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":25},{"uri":"Audio","surface_form":"audio","offset":35},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":96},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":140},{"uri":"Quality","surface_form":"quality","offset":144},{"uri":"Read-only_memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":431},{"uri":"MPEG-1","surface_form":"MPEG-1","offset":460},{"uri":"MPEG-2","surface_form":"MPEG-2","offset":471},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":701},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pieces of computer information","offset":817}]}
