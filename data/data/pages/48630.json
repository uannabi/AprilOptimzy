{"id":48630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Couric","text":"Katherine \"Katie\" Anne Couric (born January 7, 1957) was a co-host of the top-rated \"Today\" show, broadcast live on NBC affiliates, from 1991 until late 2006, earning nearly $14 million each year for the last 4 years of her contract.\nCouric was born in Arlington, Virginia. She was hired by the news division at CBS in late 2006 to anchor and be the main editor of the CBS Evening News, which operated with temporary anchors after Dan Rather's departure. Ratings have been disappointly low despite the initial fanfare and introduction of new theme music at the beginning of each show.\nCouric is active in charities, especially related to colon cancer, after the death of her husband (to colon cancer) in 1998. Couric received a colonoscopy on live television in March 2000. She also released pictures of her mammogram on television. She voiced a fish version of herself named Katie Current from the 2004 animated comedy movie Shark Tale.\nCouric has two daughters, Ellie and Caroline.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Today_Show","surface_form":"\"Today\" show","offset":84},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":116},{"uri":"Arlington%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Arlington, Virginia","offset":253},{"uri":"CBS_News","surface_form":"news","offset":295},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":312},{"uri":"Dan_Rather","surface_form":"Dan Rather","offset":431},{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charities","offset":605},{"uri":"Colon_cancer","surface_form":"colon cancer","offset":638},{"uri":"Colonoscopy","surface_form":"colonoscopy","offset":728},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":748},{"uri":"Mammogram","surface_form":"mammogram","offset":808},{"uri":"Shark_Tale","surface_form":"Shark Tale","offset":926}]}
