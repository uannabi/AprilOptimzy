{"id":48693,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritjof_Capra","text":"Fritjof Capra (born February 1, 1939) is an Austrian-American physicist.\nBorn in Vienna, Austria, Capra earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1966. He has done research on particle physics and systems theory, and has written popular books on the implications of science with ethics, metaphysics and society. In particular in \"The Tao of Physics\" he makes the assertion that physics and metaphysics are both inexorably leading to the same knowledge. His works all share a similar subtext: that \"there are hidden connections between everything\". Capra is both a Buddhist and a Catholic Christian.\nAfter touring Germany in the early 1980s, Capra co-wrote a book in 1984 with ecofeminist author Charlene Spretnak, called \"Green Politics\".\nCapra pushes for western society to abandon c the mechanistic views of Descartes. Critiquing Descartes' reductionistic view that everything can be studied in parts to understand the whole, he allows his readers to take an objective and fresh mind, encouraging them to see the world through 'complexity theory'.\nCapra is aiming for a theory of living systems, a theoretical framework for ecology. This theory has its roots in several scientific fields from the first half of the twentieth century \u2014 organismic biology, gestalt psychology, ecology, general systems theory, and cybernetics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":44},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":53},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":62},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":81},{"uri":"Ph.D.","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":113},{"uri":"Theoretical_physics","surface_form":"theoretical physics","offset":122},{"uri":"University_of_Vienna","surface_form":"University of Vienna","offset":151},{"uri":"Particle_physics","surface_form":"particle physics","offset":205},{"uri":"Systems_theory","surface_form":"systems theory","offset":226},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethics","offset":308},{"uri":"Metaphysics","surface_form":"metaphysics","offset":316},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":332},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":407},{"uri":"Metaphysics","surface_form":"metaphysics","offset":419},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":593},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":608},{"uri":"Charlene_Spretnak","surface_form":"Charlene Spretnak","offset":724},{"uri":"Mechanistic","surface_form":"mechanistic","offset":818},{"uri":"Descartes","surface_form":"Descartes","offset":839},{"uri":"Reductionistic","surface_form":"reductionistic","offset":872},{"uri":"Complexity_theory","surface_form":"complexity theory","offset":1059},{"uri":"Theory_of_living_systems","surface_form":"theory of living systems","offset":1101},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":1155},{"uri":"Organismic_biology","surface_form":"organismic biology","offset":1266},{"uri":"Gestalt_psychology","surface_form":"gestalt psychology","offset":1286},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":1306},{"uri":"Systems_theory","surface_form":"systems theory","offset":1323},{"uri":"Cybernetics","surface_form":"cybernetics","offset":1343}]}
