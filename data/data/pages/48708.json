{"id":48708,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Elizabethan Religious Settlement was Elizabeth I\u2019s answer to the religious quarrels that developed during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I.\nThis answer was given in two Acts of the Parliament of England. The Act of Supremacy of 1559 confirmed the English church\u2019s independence from Rome. The Act of Uniformity 1559 decided about the form of the English church.\nOften it was seen as the end of the English Reformation and the foundation of Anglicanism. But some historians think that England only became a Protestant nation on a popular level many years later. There seem to have been great divisions in the population and among the clergy for a long time afterwards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Elizabeth_I_of_England","surface_form":"Elizabeth I","offset":54},{"uri":"Henry_VIII_of_England","surface_form":"Henry VIII","offset":137},{"uri":"Edward_VI_of_England","surface_form":"Edward VI","offset":149},{"uri":"Mary_I_of_England","surface_form":"Mary I","offset":163},{"uri":"Parliament_of_England","surface_form":"Parliament of England","offset":212},{"uri":"Act_of_Supremacy","surface_form":"Act of Supremacy","offset":239},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":264},{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"English church\u2019s","offset":278},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":295},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":313},{"uri":"Act_of_Uniformity","surface_form":"Act of Uniformity","offset":323},{"uri":"English_Reformation","surface_form":"English Reformation","offset":428},{"uri":"Anglicanism","surface_form":"Anglicanism","offset":470},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":514},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":536},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":638},{"uri":"Clergy","surface_form":"clergy","offset":663}]}
