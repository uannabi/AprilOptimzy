It is the number of miles moved in an hour.\nMiles per hour is the unit used for speed limits on roads in the United Kingdom and the United States. It is normally abbreviated in everyday use to mph or MPH. In technical publications it is sometimes abbreviated as mi/h.\nThe SI unit for velocity (speed, with a direction of movement) is m\u00B7s\u22121 (metres per second).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit of measurement","offset":33},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"speed","offset":66},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":93},{"uri":"Hour","surface_form":"hour","offset":111},{"uri":"Speed_limit","surface_form":"speed limit","offset":153},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":169},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":182},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":205},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviated","offset":235},{"uri":"Technical","surface_form":"technical","offset":281},{"uri":"Publication","surface_form":"publication","offset":291},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":345},{"uri":"Velocity","surface_form":"velocity","offset":357},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":381},{"uri":"Metre_per_second","surface_form":"m\u00B7s\u22121","offset":407}]}
