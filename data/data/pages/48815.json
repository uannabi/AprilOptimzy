{"id":48815,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawarma","text":"Shawarma (; in) is a meat sandwich eaten by people in the Middle East. It is served in round Arabic bread with meat and vegetables, with some spice or sauce of choice, in it. Normally, the meat can either be lamb, beef, turkey, or chicken. Shawarma can also be spelled chawarma, shwarma, shawerma, or shoarmais.\nIt was first introduced by people from Turkey. They call it \"\u00E7evirme\", which means \"turning\", because the meat can be turned around in the oven, but the Arabs changed its recipe from the Turkish Doner kebab.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":21},{"uri":"Sandwich","surface_form":"sandwich","offset":26},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":58},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":111},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":120},{"uri":"Lamb_(food)","surface_form":"lamb","offset":208},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":214},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"turkey","offset":220},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":231},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":351},{"uri":"Doner_kebab","surface_form":"Doner kebab","offset":507}]}
