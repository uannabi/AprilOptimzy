{"id":48817,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant","text":"Merchants deal with trade. That means they deal goods that they do not produce themselves, in order to get profit.\nIn the US, \"merchant\" is any person while engaged in a business or profession or a seller who deals regularly in the type of goods sold. Under the common law in the United States, merchants are held to a higher standard in the selling of products than those who are not engaged in the sale of goods as a profession. For example, when a merchant sells something, he or she is expected to give a warranty, guaranteeing that the product is fit to be sold, even if there is nothing in writing to this effect.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":20},{"uri":"Product_(consumer_goods)","surface_form":"goods","offset":48},{"uri":"Profit","surface_form":"profit","offset":107},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":122},{"uri":"Common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":262},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":280},{"uri":"Warranty","surface_form":"warranty","offset":509}]}
