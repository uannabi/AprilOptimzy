It can be occur without intention in the case of domestic stains on fabric, cloth, or other material, or it can be intentional. Stains are used intentionally in a variety of fields, including research (biochemical staining), technology (metal staining), and art (wood staining, stained glass.)\nDifferent types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern textile engineering. Various laundry techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and stain removers are an important type of chemical in laundry detergents. Some stand-alone stain removers also exist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Intention","surface_form":"intention","offset":118},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"fabric","offset":162},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":170},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":286},{"uri":"Staining_(biology)","surface_form":"biochemical staining","offset":296},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":319},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":352},{"uri":"Wood_staining","surface_form":"wood staining","offset":357},{"uri":"Stained_glass","surface_form":"stained glass","offset":372},{"uri":"Textile_engineering","surface_form":"textile engineering","offset":518},{"uri":"Laundry_detergent","surface_form":"laundry detergent","offset":678}]}
