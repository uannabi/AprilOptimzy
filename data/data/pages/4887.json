{"id":4887,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon","text":"Carbon is a very important chemical element, with a chemical symbol of C. All known life on Earth needs it. Carbon has atomic mass 12 and atomic number 6. It is a nonmetal, meaning that it is not a metal.\nWhen iron is alloy<nowiki/>ed with carbon, hard steel is formed. Carbon in the form of coal is an important fuel.\nChemistry of carbon.\nA whole type of Chemistry, organic chemistry, is about carbon and its compounds. Carbon makes many types of compounds. \"Hydrocarbons\" are molecules with carbon and hydrogen. Methane, Propane, and many other fuels are hydrocarbons. Many of the substances that people use daily are organic compounds.\nCarbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and some other elements like sulfur and phosphorus together form most life on earth (see List of biologically important elements). Carbon forms a very large number of organic compounds because it can form strong bonds with itself and with other elements. Because of the amounts of carbon living things have, all organic things are considered \"carbon-based\". Each carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds. These bonds allow carbon to form long chain-shaped molecules, called polymers, such as plastics.\nEtymology.\nThe name of carbon comes from Latin \"carbo\", meaning charcoal. In many foreign languages the words for carbon, coal and charcoal are synonyms.\nTypes of carbon.\nCarbon in nature is found in three forms called allotropes: diamond, graphite, and fullerenes. Graphite, with clay, is in pencils. It is very soft. The carbon atoms in it make rings, which are on top of each other and slide very easily. Diamonds are the hardest natural mineral. Fullerenes are a \"soccer ball\" shape of carbon. They are mostly of interest to science. A special, man-made, tube-shaped allotrope of carbon is the carbon nanotube. Carbon nanotubes are very hard, so they might be used in armor. Nanotubes might be useful in nanotechnology.\nThere are 10 million known carbon compounds.\nRadiocarbon dating.\nA radioactive isotope of carbon, carbon-14, can be used to figure out how old some objects are or when something died. As long as something is on the surface of the earth and taking in carbon, the amount of carbon-14 stays the same. When an object stops taking in carbon, the carbon-14 amount goes down. Because the \"half-life\" (how long it takes for half of a radioactive isotope to go away) of carbon-14 is 5730 years, scientists can see how old the object is by how much carbon-14 is left.\nWhere carbon is.\nCarbon is in many places in the universe. It was first made in old stars. Carbon is the fourth most common element in the sun. The atmospheres of Venus and Mars are mostly carbon dioxide.\nCarbon is important to the human body and other living things, and it is the second most common element in the human body, at 23% of all body weight. It is also a key part of many biological molecules (molecules used in life).\nMost of the carbon on Earth is coal. Graphite is in many (typically desert) areas, including Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and Russia. Diamonds are rare and are found largely in Africa. Carbon is also in some meteorites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":27},{"uri":"Chemical_symbol","surface_form":"chemical symbol","offset":52},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":84},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":92},{"uri":"Atomic_mass","surface_form":"atomic mass","offset":119},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":138},{"uri":"Nonmetal","surface_form":"nonmetal","offset":163},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":198},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":210},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":218},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":253},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":292},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":313},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":367},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compounds","offset":410},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"Methane","offset":514},{"uri":"Propane","surface_form":"Propane","offset":523},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":547},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":647},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":657},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":667},{"uri":"Sulfur","surface_form":"sulfur","offset":704},{"uri":"Phosphorus","surface_form":"phosphorus","offset":715},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":753},{"uri":"List_of_biologically_important_elements","surface_form":"List of biologically important elements","offset":764},{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":842},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bonds","offset":887},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalent bond","offset":1071},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":1138},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":1156},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":1174},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1225},{"uri":"Charcoal","surface_form":"charcoal","offset":1248},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":1306},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":1365},{"uri":"Allotrope","surface_form":"allotrope","offset":1403},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":1415},{"uri":"Graphite","surface_form":"graphite","offset":1424},{"uri":"Fullerenes","surface_form":"fullerenes","offset":1438},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":1465},{"uri":"Pencil","surface_form":"pencil","offset":1477},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":1625},{"uri":"Soccer","surface_form":"soccer","offset":1652},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":1713},{"uri":"Carbon_nanotube","surface_form":"carbon nanotube","offset":1782},{"uri":"Armor","surface_form":"armor","offset":1856},{"uri":"Nanotechnology","surface_form":"nanotechnology","offset":1892},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compounds","offset":1942},{"uri":"Radioactive","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":1975},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":1987},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half-life","offset":2290},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":2394},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":2550},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":2605},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":2614},{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Venus","offset":2629},{"uri":"Mars_(planet)","surface_form":"Mars","offset":2639},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":2655},{"uri":"Human_body","surface_form":"human body","offset":2698},{"uri":"Living_thing","surface_form":"living thing","offset":2719},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":2873},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":2929},{"uri":"Graphite","surface_form":"Graphite","offset":2935},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":2966},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":2991},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":3002},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":3018},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":3069}]}
