{"id":48896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics","text":"=\"preserve\">Applied mechanics, also known as theoretical and applied mechanics, is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics. Applied mechanics examines the \"response of bodies (solids and fluids) to external forces\". Some examples of \"mechanical systems\" include the flow of a liquid under pressure, the fracture of a solid from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound. A practitioner of the discipline is known as a mechanician.\nApplied mechanics, as its name suggests, bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to technology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physical science","offset":99},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanics","offset":150},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":213},{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":224},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"forces","offset":244},{"uri":"Flux","surface_form":"flow","offset":303},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":313},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":326},{"uri":"Material_fracture","surface_form":"fracture","offset":340},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":354},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":376},{"uri":"Vibration","surface_form":"vibration","offset":390},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":425},{"uri":"Mechanician","surface_form":"mechanician","offset":479},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":596}]}
