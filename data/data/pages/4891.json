{"id":4891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction","text":"Some reactions are fast, and others are slow. Some happen at different speeds, depending on temperature or other things. For example, wood does not react with air when it is cold, but if it is made hot enough, it will start to burn. Some reactions give out energy. These are exothermic reactions. In other reactions, energy is taken in. These are endothermic reactions.\nNuclear reactions are \"not\" chemical reactions. Chemical reactions involve only the electrons of atoms; nuclear reactions involve the protons and neutrons in the atomic nuclei.\nSynthesis.\nIn a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance.\nAnother example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance, such as water.\nDouble replacement.\nFor example, when barium chloride (BaCl2) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) react, the SO42\u2212 anion switches places with the 2Cl\u2212 anion, giving the compounds BaSO4 and MgCl2.\nEquations.\nformula_1","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":92},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":134},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":159},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":257},{"uri":"Exothermic_reaction","surface_form":"exothermic reaction","offset":275},{"uri":"Endothermic_reaction","surface_form":"endothermic reaction","offset":347},{"uri":"Nuclear_reaction","surface_form":"Nuclear reaction","offset":370},{"uri":"Electrons","surface_form":"electrons","offset":454},{"uri":"Protons","surface_form":"protons","offset":504},{"uri":"Neutrons","surface_form":"neutrons","offset":516},{"uri":"Atomic_nucleus","surface_form":"atomic nuclei","offset":532},{"uri":"Barium_chloride","surface_form":"barium chloride","offset":816},{"uri":"Magnesium_sulfate","surface_form":"magnesium sulfate","offset":844}]}
