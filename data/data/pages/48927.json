{"id":48927,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism","text":"Pantheism is the belief that God and the universe are equivalent (the same thing). A pantheist believes that everything that exists is a part of God or that God is a part of everything that exists. The name pantheism comes from the Greek words theism (belief in God) and pan (all).\nAny doctrine or philosophy that believes that the universe and everything in it is God is said to be pantheistic. Most pantheists believe the universe is sacred and the earth and nature are divine.\nMost of the early Greek philosophers from Thales on to the Stoics believed in some sort of pantheism.\nPantheism is an important part of many eastern religions such as Hinduism, Druidism and Taoism.\nSome western philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and some scientists are pantheists.\nSome Christians, Jews and Sufis are Pantheists. However, their majority believes that while God is in everything, there is more to God than just the universe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":29},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":41},{"uri":"Equivalent","surface_form":"equivalent","offset":54},{"uri":"Doctrine","surface_form":"doctrine","offset":286},{"uri":"Thales","surface_form":"Thales","offset":522},{"uri":"Stoic","surface_form":"Stoic","offset":539},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":647},{"uri":"Druidism","surface_form":"Druidism","offset":657},{"uri":"Taoism","surface_form":"Taoism","offset":670},{"uri":"Baruch_Spinoza","surface_form":"Baruch Spinoza","offset":712},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christians","offset":768},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jews","offset":780},{"uri":"Sufism","surface_form":"Sufis","offset":789}]}
