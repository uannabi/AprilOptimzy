Mainly, it is used for pleasure and relaxation, but sometimes there are meetings and demonstrations in Trafalgar Square.\nWhen the square was first built, demonstrations were banned. The ban lasted until the 1880s, when the new Labour movement start to hold demonstrations. One group that did this was the Social Democratic Federation.

In 1990 there were riots against the Poll tax. In the 2000s there have been demonstrations against the Iraq war.\nIn recent years the square has become a gathering place for celebrations. When England won the Rugby World Cup in 2003 thousands of fans gathered in the square.
