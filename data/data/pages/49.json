{"id":49,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture","text":"Architecture is designing the structures of buildings. It uses both art and engineering. Examples include houses, churches, hotels, office buildings, roads, viaducts, tunnels and bridges.\nArchitecture is the profession of an architect. Usually, a person must study at an institution of higher education (university) to become an architect. There were architects long before there was higher education. They learnt by being an apprentice to an established architect.\nArchitecture can do small designs, such as for a garage, or large designs, such as for a whole city. The capital cities of Bras\u00EDlia, and Canberra were designed. Architecture often overlaps with structural engineering, and architects and engineers often work together.\n__TOC__\nHistory.\nIn the past, people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures, like the Great Pyramids of Giza. The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call \"Classical Architecture\". The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the arch from the Etruscans, who copied it from the Mesopotamians.\nClassical architecture was formal, and it always obeyed laws. It used symmetry, which really means balance, and it used proportion between shapes. The Golden Mean was a rule which said, (to put it simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times as long as the short side. There are many 'laws' in classical architecture, like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are often used today. However, today more notice is taken of specific facts, such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century. Several bridges have blown down because that was not properly taken into consideration.\nIn some parts of the world, like India, the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles occur in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.\nArchitects in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture, then Gothic architecture. Gothic buildings have tall, pointed windows and arches. Many churches have Gothic architecture. Castles were also built at this time. In Eastern Europe, churches usually had domes. People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past. The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas.\nIn the late 18th century with the Industrial Revolution, people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many factories and mills were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the Victorian era, architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in Ulm, Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse. This happened to the Beauvais Cathedral, which was never completed.\nTowards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, steel became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build. An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them skyscrapers. This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.\nModernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called \"post-modern\".\nMany of the world's greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright; Sir Hugh Casson; Norman Foster; I. M. Pei; Adrian Smith; Edward Durell Stone; Frank Gehry; Fazlur Khan; Gottfried B\u00F6hm; and Bruce Graham.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":16},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":30},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":44},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":68},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":76},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":114},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":124},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":132},{"uri":"Viaduct","surface_form":"viaduct","offset":157},{"uri":"Tunnel","surface_form":"tunnel","offset":167},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":179},{"uri":"Profession","surface_form":"profession","offset":208},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":225},{"uri":"Study","surface_form":"study","offset":259},{"uri":"Institution","surface_form":"institution","offset":271},{"uri":"Higher_education","surface_form":"higher
