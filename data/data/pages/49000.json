{"id":49000,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_strength","text":"=\"preserve\">Compressive strength measures the pushing force that one needs to break a material.\nWhen the limit of compressive strength is reached, materials are crushed. Concrete can be made to have high compressive strength e.g. many concrete floors have compressive strength of 3000 p.s.i..","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":54},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":86},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"Concrete","offset":170}]}
