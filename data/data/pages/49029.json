Only smaller plants are often called weeds.\nIf someone is farming a plant and it then moves outside the farm, the plant may then be called a weed.\nSome plants are very hard to stop once they start growing. These are called invasive weeds.\nWeed is also a name for any wild plant, one that people do not use for anything.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":12},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":144},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":238},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive","offset":309},{"uri":"Wild","surface_form":"wild","offset":353},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":358}]}
