Many machines work on hydraulic power.\nOne of the founders of modern hydraulics was Benedetto Castelli, a student of Galileo Galilei.\nFluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the engineering uses of fluid properties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":25},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":37},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":99},{"uri":"Benedetto_Castelli","surface_form":"Benedetto Castelli","offset":192},{"uri":"Galileo_Galilei","surface_form":"Galileo Galilei","offset":225},{"uri":"Fluid_mechanics","surface_form":"Fluid mechanics","offset":242},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":331}]}
