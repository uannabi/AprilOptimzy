{"id":49175,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending","text":"\"This article is about the structural behavior. For other meanings see Bending (disambiguation).\"\nIn engineering and mechanics, bending (also known as flexure) characterizes the behavior of a structural element subjected to a lateral load (i.e. at right angles to its length).\nA structural element subjected to bending is known as a beam. Stiffness is its ability to resist bending.\nA closet rod sagging under the weight of clothes is an example of a beam experiencing bending.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bending_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"Bending (disambiguation)","offset":71},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":101},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanics","offset":117},{"uri":"Element","surface_form":"element","offset":203},{"uri":"Load","surface_form":"load","offset":234},{"uri":"Beam_(structure)","surface_form":"beam","offset":333},{"uri":"Closet","surface_form":"closet","offset":385}]}
