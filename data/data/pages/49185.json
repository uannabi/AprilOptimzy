{"id":49185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_moment_of_inertia","text":"e=\"preserve\"> \"Note:\" \"Different disciplines use the term \"moment of inertia\" to refer to different moments. In physics, \"moment of inertia\" is strictly the second moment of mass with respect to distance from an axis, which characterizes an object's angular acceleration due to an applied torque. In engineering (especially mechanical and civil), \"moment of inertia\" commonly refers to the second moment of the area. When reading \"polar moment of inertia\" take care to verify that it is referring to \"polar second moment of area\" and not \"moment of inertia\". Polar second moment of area will have units of length to the fourth power (e.g. formula_1 or formula_1), while moment of inertia is mass times length squared (e.g. formula_1 or formula_1).\"\nThe polar second moment of area (also referred to as \"polar moment of inertia\") is a measure of an object's ability to resist torsion as a function of its shape. It is one aspect of the second moment of area linked through the perpendicular axis theorem where the planar second moment of area uses a beam's cross-sectional shape to describe its resistance to deformation (bending) when subjected to a force applied in a plane parallel to its neutral axis, the polar second moment of area uses a beam's cross-sectional shape to describe its resistance to deformation (torsion) when a moment (torque) is applied in a plane perpendicular to the beam's neutral axis. While the planar second moment of area is most often denoted by the letter, formula_1, the polar second moment of area is most often denoted by either, formula_1, or the letter, formula_1, in engineering textbooks.\nThe calculated values for the polar second moment of area are most often used describe a solid or hollow cylindrical shaft's resistance to torsion, as in a vehicle's axle or drive shaft. When applied to non-cylindrical beams or shafts, the calculations for the polar second moment of area becomes erroneous due to warping of the shaft/beam. In these instances, a torsional constant should be used, where a correctional constant is added to the value's calculation.\nThe polar second moment of area carries the units of length to the fourth power (formula_1); meters to the fourth power (formula_1) in the metric unit system, and inches to the fourth power (formula_1) in the imperial unit system. The mathematical formula for direct calculation is given as a multiple integral over a shape's area, formula_1, at a distance formula_1 from an arbitrary axis formula_1.\nformula_1.\nIn the most simple form, the polar second moment of area is a summation of the two planar second moments of area, formula_1 and formula_1. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from axis formula_1, formula_1, can be broken into its formula_1 and formula_1 components, and the change in area, formula_1, broken into its formula_1 and formula_1 components, formula_1 and formula_1.\nformula_1, and formula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1\nWhere formula_1 is the applied moment (torque) and formula_1 is the length of the beam. As shown, higher torques and beam lengths lead to higher angular deflections, where higher values for the polar second moment of area, formula_1, and material shear modulus, formula_1, reduces the potential for angular deflections.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moment_of_inertia","surface_form":"moment of inertia","offset":122},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":289},{"uri":"Torsion_(mechanics)","surface_form":"torsion","offset":875},{"uri":"Second_moment_of_area","surface_form":"second moment of area","offset":935},{"uri":"Perpendicular_axis_theorem","surface_form":"perpendicular axis theorem","offset":976},{"uri":"Cross_section_(geometry)","surface_form":"cross-sectional","offset":1056},{"uri":"Deformation","surface_form":"deformation","offset":1108},{"uri":"Bending","surface_form":"bending","offset":1121},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":1150},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":1169},{"uri":"Torsion_(mechanics)","surface_form":"torsion","offset":1316},{"uri":"Moment_(physics)","surface_form":"moment","offset":1332},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":1340},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"perpendicular","offset":1370},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":1604},{"uri":"Axle","surface_form":"axle","offset":1793},{"uri":"Driveshaft","surface_form":"drive shaft","offset":1801},{"uri":"Torsion_constant","surface_form":"torsional constant","offset":1990},{"uri":"Metric_system","surface_form":"metric unit system","offset":2231},{"uri":"Imperial_units","surface_form":"imperial unit system","offset":2301},{"uri":"Pythagorean_theorem","surface_form":"Pythagorean theorem","offset":2653}]}
