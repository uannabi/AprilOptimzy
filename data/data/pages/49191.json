{"id":49191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gila_monster","text":"The Gila monster () is a venomous desert lizard. The Gila monster\u2019s name comes from the Gila River in Arizona, USA.\nThe Gila monster is heavy and slow for a lizard. It can grow up to 2 feet(60\u00A0cm) long. Its skin looks like beads and is black, pink, orange, and yellow. It looks a lot like the Mexican beaded lizard, which is its closest relative.\nThe Gila monster can bite quickly and hold on tightly, but it does not kill humans. It usually eats small rodents, young birds and eggs. The lizard chews its prey, injecting its venom (poison) into the animal through teeth in its lower jaw. The Gila monster can also store food in its tail.\nIn 2005 a medicine to treat diabetes was made from the Gila monster\u2019s saliva. Some people who take it call it \"lizard spit\" as a joke.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venomous","offset":25},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":34},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":41},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"River","offset":93},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":102},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":111},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":207},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":236},{"uri":"Pink","surface_form":"pink","offset":243},{"uri":"Orange_(color)","surface_form":"orange","offset":249},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":261},{"uri":"Rodents","surface_form":"rodents","offset":453},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":468},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":478},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":505},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":532},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":549},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":583},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":620},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":632},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":648},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":666},{"uri":"Saliva","surface_form":"saliva","offset":708},{"uri":"Joke","surface_form":"joke","offset":767}]}
