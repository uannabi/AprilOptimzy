{"id":49308,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_bug","text":"The true bugs are an order of insects. Biologists call true bugs the Hemiptera. There are around 80,000 species of true bugs. The word \"bug\" by itself can have other meanings.\nThere are many different kinds of true bugs, some of which are aphids, cicadas, planthoppers, shield bugs, and others. All of these are true bugs. Their size is from 1\u00A0mm to over 10\u00A0cm. All true bugs have similar mouthparts, which they use to suck up plant sap.\nFeatures of true bugs.\nBugs have piercing, sucking mouthparts: this defines the Hemiptera. They pierce plants with their long, tube-like mouth, called a proboscis or a beak. They cannot chew. The true bug pumps saliva through this mouth, to partly digest their food. It then sucks up the food, which is usually plant sap.\nThe name \"Hemiptera\" is from the Greek: it means \"hemi\" (half) and \"pteron\" (wing). Most true bugs have half of their front wings hardened and have the other half soft. These wings are called \"hemelytra\" (singular \"hemelytron\"), because they halfway look like the hard wings (elytra) of beetles. The hind wings are totally soft and are shorter than the front wings.\nThe antennae of bugs usually have five segments. The tarsi (foot parts) of their legs have three or fewer segments.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":21},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":30},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"Biologist","offset":39},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":104},{"uri":"Bug","surface_form":"bug","offset":136},{"uri":"Aphid","surface_form":"aphid","offset":239},{"uri":"Cicada","surface_form":"cicada","offset":247},{"uri":"Planthopper","surface_form":"planthopper","offset":256},{"uri":"Shield_bug","surface_form":"shield bug","offset":270},{"uri":"Millimetre","surface_form":"mm","offset":344},{"uri":"Centimetre","surface_form":"cm","offset":358},{"uri":"Mouthparts","surface_form":"mouthparts","offset":389},{"uri":"Plant_sap","surface_form":"plant sap","offset":427},{"uri":"Proboscis","surface_form":"proboscis","offset":591},{"uri":"Beak","surface_form":"beak","offset":606},{"uri":"Saliva","surface_form":"saliva","offset":649},{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"digest","offset":686},{"uri":"Sap","surface_form":"sap","offset":755},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":793},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":884},{"uri":"Singular","surface_form":"singular","offset":965},{"uri":"Elytra","surface_form":"elytra","offset":1036},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":1047},{"uri":"Antenna_(biology)","surface_form":"antennae","offset":1130}]}
