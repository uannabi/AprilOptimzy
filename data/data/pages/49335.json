{"id":49335,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering_iron","text":"A soldering iron is a device used to attach pieces of metal together with solder, which is called soldering. Soldering irons are used mainly for attaching electronic components onto a circuit board with tin, but can also be used for other tasks such as fixing jewelry. There are several different kinds of soldering irons, such as ones that are hotter than others, and ones that use electricity or natural gas.\nA soldering iron stand can be used to hold the iron. That is a flat metal stand with a coil that holds the iron.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"device","offset":22},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":54},{"uri":"Solder","surface_form":"solder","offset":74},{"uri":"Soldering","surface_form":"soldering","offset":98},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":155},{"uri":"Circuit_board","surface_form":"circuit board","offset":184},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":203},{"uri":"Jewelry","surface_form":"jewelry","offset":260}]}
