{"id":49353,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_(manufacturing)","text":"=\"preserve\">Drawing is a manufacturing process for producing a wire, bar or tube by pulling on a material until it increases in length. This is typically accompanied by a thinning out of the material, usually through a reduction in the girth.\nThis technique has long been used to produce flexible metal wire by drawing the material through a series of holes of decreasing size. More recently drawing has been used with molten glass to produce high quality optical fibers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":25},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":63},{"uri":"Tube","surface_form":"tube","offset":76},{"uri":"Reduction","surface_form":"reduction","offset":219},{"uri":"Girth","surface_form":"girth","offset":236},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":297},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":303},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":426},{"uri":"Optical_fiber","surface_form":"optical fiber","offset":456}]}
