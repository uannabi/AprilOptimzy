{"id":49416,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felt","text":"Felt is a type of cloth that is made by matting wool fibers, either with water and soap, or by poking the fibers with barbed needles. Felt can be made by hand, or by machine.\nPeople have been making felt longer than any other kind of fabric. Felt can be of any color, and made into any shape or size. Felt is used to make many things like clothing, hats, and rugs. Nomadic people in many countries live in tents made of felt.\nFelt is used for many different things. Today people use felt for hat-making, insulating (making warm), sound-proofing, and cushioning.\nFelt versus fabric.\nThe difference between felt and most fabrics, like denim, is that most fabrics have a regular criss-cross, in-and-out weaving pattern, but felt is a messy jumble of fibers.\nMost fabrics are woven for strength and smoothness: they need carding to straighten the fibers, spinning to turn fibers into long threads and weaving to make fabric.\nFelt only needs a carding comb. Because of this, felt was often used by nomadic people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":18},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":48},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fibers","offset":53},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":73},{"uri":"Soap","surface_form":"soap","offset":83},{"uri":"Needle_felting","surface_form":"poking the fibers","offset":95},{"uri":"Needle","surface_form":"needle","offset":125},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":166},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"fabric","offset":234},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":261},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":286},{"uri":"Size","surface_form":"size","offset":295},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":339},{"uri":"Hats","surface_form":"hats","offset":349},{"uri":"Rug","surface_form":"rug","offset":359},{"uri":"Nomadic_people","surface_form":"Nomadic people","offset":365},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":388},{"uri":"Tent","surface_form":"tent","offset":406},{"uri":"Hat","surface_form":"hat","offset":492},{"uri":"Cushion","surface_form":"cushion","offset":550},{"uri":"Denim","surface_form":"denim","offset":633},{"uri":"Weaving","surface_form":"weaving","offset":700},{"uri":"Jumble","surface_form":"jumble","offset":737},{"uri":"Fiber","surface_form":"fiber","offset":747},{"uri":"Comb","surface_form":"comb","offset":947}]}
