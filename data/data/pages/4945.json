{"id":4945,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera","text":"A soap opera is a television or radio program that airs in episodic series. This means that each episode continues telling a story, which, in turn, tells more of the last episode's story. A single story on a soap opera can be told for weeks, months, or sometimes even years.\nIn America, each soap opera airs every day, Monday through Friday, in the afternoon. Because they air at this time, they are sometimes called daytime serials'\". In the U.K. and other countries, the soap operas air in the evening, twice or three times a week.\nThere are still two soaps that air in Australia, Network Ten's \"Neighbours\" and the Seven Network's \"Home and Away\". Strangely, \"Neighbours\" is more popular in England than it is in Australia.\nIn the U.K., the most popular soap operas are \"Coronation Street\" and \"EastEnders\". \"Coronation Street\" is about people who live in Manchester, in the northern part of England. \"EastEnders\" is about people who live in an imaginary place called Albert Square in the East End of London. Another popular soap opera is \"Emmerdale\", and it is about people who live in a small village in Yorkshire, also in the northern part of England. In the 1970s \"Crossroads\" became the most watched soap in England. It was shown from 1964 to 1988.\nIn Latin America (including Brazil) and Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa (like Angola), soap operas are called \"telenovelas\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":18},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":32},{"uri":"Broadcast","surface_form":"airs","offset":51},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episodic","offset":59},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":278},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"U.K.","offset":443},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":572},{"uri":"Network_Ten","surface_form":"Network Ten","offset":583},{"uri":"Neighbours","surface_form":"Neighbours","offset":598},{"uri":"Seven_Network","surface_form":"Seven Network","offset":618},{"uri":"Home_and_Away","surface_form":"Home and Away","offset":635},{"uri":"Coronation_Street","surface_form":"Coronation Street","offset":774},{"uri":"EastEnders","surface_form":"EastEnders","offset":798},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":859},{"uri":"East_End","surface_form":"East End","offset":992},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1004},{"uri":"Emmerdale","surface_form":"Emmerdale","offset":1043},{"uri":"Yorkshire","surface_form":"Yorkshire","offset":1109},{"uri":"Crossroads_(British_TV_series)","surface_form":"Crossroads","offset":1172},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":1260},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1285},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":1297},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1330},{"uri":"Angola","surface_form":"Angola","offset":1343},{"uri":"Telenovela","surface_form":"telenovela","offset":1376}]}
