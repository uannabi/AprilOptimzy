{"id":49520,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_metre","text":"=\"preserve\">The Newton metre is the unit of moment in the SI system. It is abbreviated N\u00B7m, and sometimes written with hyphen \"newton-metre\". It is a compound unit of torque corresponding to the torque from a force of one newton applied over a distance arm of one metre.\nA newton metre is dimensionally equivalent to a joule.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unit_of_Measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":36},{"uri":"Moment_(physics)","surface_form":"moment","offset":44},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":58},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":167},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":209},{"uri":"Newton_(unit)","surface_form":"newton","offset":222},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":264},{"uri":"Joule","surface_form":"joule","offset":319}]}
