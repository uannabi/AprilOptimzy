{"id":49559,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key","text":"The shift key is a key on a computer keyboard. It is used to type capital letters (like this: \"ABC\") instead of lowercase (\"abc\").\nThe way the shift key works is that it needs to be held down while the other key is pressed. Because of this, there are usually two shift keys, on the left and right sides of the keyboard, and they are held down using one of the little fingers while the other finger presses the other key.\nInstead of using the shift key, one can also use the caps lock or shift lock keys. This lets one type many uppercase letters at once without having to hold down the shift key all the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_keyboard","surface_form":"computer keyboard","offset":28},{"uri":"Capital_letter","surface_form":"capital letter","offset":66},{"uri":"Finger","surface_form":"finger","offset":367},{"uri":"Caps_lock","surface_form":"caps lock","offset":474}]}
