{"id":49565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth","text":"Girth is the circumference of a cylindrical object, such as a tree trunk.\nGirth is sometimes used by postal services and delivery companies as basis for pricing. For example, (for at least one delivery company), if one has a box to ship, it has three sides: length (the longest side) and height and width. The girth in this case is 2 * (height + width).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circumference","surface_form":"circumference","offset":13},{"uri":"Cylinder","surface_form":"cylindrical","offset":32},{"uri":"Trunk_(botany)","surface_form":"tree trunk","offset":62}]}
