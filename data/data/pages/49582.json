{"id":49582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber","text":"Lumber (or timber) is wood that has been cut for use in building.\nDimensional lumber.\nDimensional lumber is a term used in North America for lumber that is finished/planed and cut to standardized width and depth specified in inches.\nSoftwoods.\nExamples of common sizes are 2\u00D74 (also two-by-four and other variants), 2\u00D76, and 4\u00D74. The length of a board is usually specified separately from the width and depth. It is thus possible to find 2\u00D74s that are four, eight, or twelve feet in length. In the United States the standard lengths of lumber are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 feet.\nNon-North American sizes.\nOutside North America sizes of timber vary slightly. Sizes are, in some cases, based on the imperial measurement and referred to as such; in other cases the sizes are too far removed from the imperial size to be referred to by imperial measurement. Lengths can be sold at every 300\u00A0mm (a metric approximation of 1'). Common sizes are similar to the North American equivalent; 2.4, 2.7, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, 5.4, 6.0. But also in running lengths, where each plank in a given packet is different, from 2500mm to 5500mm, though shorter and longer may be present.\nHardwoods.\nIn North America sizes for dimensional lumber made from hardwoods varies from the sizes for softwoods. Boards are usually supplied in random widths and lengths of a specified thickness, and sold by the board-foot (144 cubic inches).\nEngineered Lumber.\nEngineered lumber is lumber created by a manufacturer and designed for a certain structural purpose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":22},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":56},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":123},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":225},{"uri":"Board-foot","surface_form":"board-foot","offset":1392}]}
