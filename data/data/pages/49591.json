{"id":49591,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)","text":"So a car suspension is not just a set of components for connecting wheels and body or frame, but a complex system that makes normal and comfortable movement on car driving.\nShock Absorbers.\nShock absorbers, as a damping element of a modern suspension, convert vibrational energy into heat. The amount of energy absorbed depends on the mass of the car, the stiffness of the spring and the vibration frequency.\nLinkages.\nUsing these elements, the suspension parts are fastened together, and also the suspension is attached to the body or frame of the car. The fasteners can be either a regular bolted connection (like other types of rigid joints), or a connection using special elastic elements - rubber-metal hinges (or silent-blocks).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Damping_element","surface_form":"damping element","offset":212},{"uri":"Suspension","surface_form":"suspension","offset":240}]}
