{"id":49621,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_(linguistics)","text":"=\"preserve\">In syntactic analysis, a constituent is a word or a group of words that functions as one unit within a hierarchical structure.\nPhrases (noun phrases, verbal phrases, etc.) are usually constituents of a clause, but clauses may also be combined into a bigger structure. For example, in the phrase \"I didn't hear what you said,\" the subordinate clause \"what you said\" is combined into the main clause and is syntactically its object; this can be demonstrated by substituting the pronoun \"it\" for the subordinate clause \"I didn't hear it.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntactic","offset":15},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchical","offset":115},{"uri":"Phrase","surface_form":"Phrase","offset":139},{"uri":"Clause","surface_form":"clause","offset":214},{"uri":"Dependent_clause","surface_form":"subordinate clause","offset":342},{"uri":"Pronoun","surface_form":"pronoun","offset":488}]}
