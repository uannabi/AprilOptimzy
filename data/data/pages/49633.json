{"id":49633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan_language","text":"The Okinawan language (\u6C96\u7E04\u53E3, \"Uchin\u0101guchi\") is a Ryukyuan language that is spoken in the Okinawa Islands of Japan.\nMost linguists say that it branched off from Proto-Japonic, which is the ancestor of Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages. The Japanese government says Okinawan is a dialect of Japanese because of politics.\nHistory.\nWhen a group of people called the Yayoi came into the Ryukyu Islands, they brought over a language called Proto-Japonic. This language over time turned into the modern Ryukyuan languages. Proto-Japonic was also spoken in mainland Japan, which turned into Japanese, meaning Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages are related/have the same origin.\nOkinawan and other Ryukyuan languages were discriminated by Japan during the Meiji period, making the number of speakers go down. Before that, Okinawan was the official language of the Ryukyu Kingdom.\nClassification.\nOkinawan belongs to the Ryukyuan languages. It is in the northern group with both Kunigami and Amami. Sometimes, Kunigami is listed as a dialect of Okinawan but that view is rare.\nSpeakers.\nMost older Okinawans speak Okinawan while younger Okinawans speak Japanese. This is why UNESCO lists Okinawan and the other Ryukyuan languages as \u201Cendangered\u201D, meaning it\u2019s possible for the language to die out in the future.\nSound Changes (Japanese vs. Okinawan).\nJapanese \u201Co\u201D - Okinawan \u201Cu\u201D (Okinawa = Uchinaa)\nJapanese \u201Ck\u201D - Okinawan \u201Cch\u201D (Okinawa = Uchinaa)\nJapanese \u201Cmi\u201D - Okinawan \u201Cnn\u201D (minato = nnatu)\nSimilar sound changes are in other Ryukyuan languages. Kunigami also uses \u201Cu\u201D instead of Japanese \u201Co\u201D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ryukyuan_languages","surface_form":"Ryukyuan language","offset":48},{"uri":"Okinawa","surface_form":"Okinawa Islands","offset":88},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":107},{"uri":"Linguist","surface_form":"linguist","offset":119},{"uri":"Proto-Japonic_language","surface_form":"Proto-Japonic","offset":159},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":199},{"uri":"Ryukyuan_languages","surface_form":"Ryukyuan languages","offset":216},{"uri":"Meiji_period","surface_form":"Meiji period","offset":749},{"uri":"Ryukyu_Kingdom","surface_form":"Ryukyu Kingdom","offset":857},{"uri":"Northern_Ryukyuan_languages","surface_form":"northern group","offset":946},{"uri":"Kunigami_language","surface_form":"Kunigami","offset":971},{"uri":"Amami_language","surface_form":"Amami","offset":984},{"uri":"Kunigami_language","surface_form":"Kunigami","offset":1542}]}
