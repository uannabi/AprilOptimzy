{"id":497,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language","text":"A first language (also mother tongue, native language, arterial language, or L1) often means the language that a person learns first. It helps one understand words and concepts in the style of that language.\nSometimes, \"first language\" means the language that a person speaks best (the second language is then spoken less well than the first language, etc.). Since \"first language\", \"second language\" and \"third language\" then mean how well one speaks a language, a person can have more than one first language or second language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Second_language","surface_form":"second language","offset":286}]}
