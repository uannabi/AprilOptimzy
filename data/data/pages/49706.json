{"id":49706,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_sword-making","text":"e=\"preserve\">Japanese schools of sword making can be divided into two categories: by the provinces where they were developed and by the masters who created a specific tradition of sword making.\nHistory.\nThe late Kamakura period is often referred to as the greatest period of sword making in Japanese history. The Soshu tradition was one of the dominant traditions. Smiths like Kunitsuna and Sukezane combined their knowledge with methods from Yamashiro and Bizen traditions. Finally, a group of famous sword smiths culminated with Masamune (1264-1343 AD) and his school.\nTypes of Sword.\nThe rare swords were made out of five separate pieces and heat-treated at high temperatures. The swords of the Masamune School were harder than any of the swords made before. Masamune trained a group of at least ten followers. Two of his students (Kanemitsu and Nagayoshi) were from the Bizen province. In this way, during the early 14th century, the Masamune school attracted many smiths from other schools. Kanemitsu is believed to be the one who created the Soden School, which combined Bizen and Soshu techniques.\nAt the same time Chogi was developing his school. The Chogi works show a stronger influence of the Soshu tradition than Kanemitsu swords.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":13},{"uri":"Sword","surface_form":"sword","offset":33},{"uri":"Kamakura","surface_form":"Kamakura","offset":212},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":666},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":1187}]}
