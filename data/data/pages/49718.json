{"id":49718,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornamental_plant","text":"An ornamental plant is a plant that is grown for how it looks, and not for its commercial or other value. The term is often shortened to ornamental (usually as a noun) when used in the context of plants.\nOrnamental plants are usually grown in the flower garden, or as house plants. They are usually grown for the display of their flowers. Other common ornamental features include leaves, scent, fruit, stem and bark. In all cases, their purpose is the enjoyment of gardeners and visitors. Or to show their beauty. Ornamental plants may also be used for landscaping, and for cut flowers. The cultivation, called floriculture, is a major branch of horticulture.\nOrnamental plants come in a range of shapes, sizes and colours suitable to a broad array of climates, landscapes, and gardening needs. They are also often chosen for specialised looks or feels in landscape gardening.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":25},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":254},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":330},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":380},{"uri":"Scent","surface_form":"scent","offset":388},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":395},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":402},{"uri":"Bark","surface_form":"bark","offset":411},{"uri":"Landscaping","surface_form":"landscaping","offset":553},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":578},{"uri":"Floriculture","surface_form":"floriculture","offset":611},{"uri":"Horticulture","surface_form":"horticulture","offset":646}]}
