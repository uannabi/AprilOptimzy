{"id":4973,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ordinal numbers (or ordinals) are numbers that show something's order, for example: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.\nSuppose a person has four different T-shirts, and then lays them in front of the person, from left to right.\nIf the person then starts counting the shirts from the left, he would first see the red shirt. So the red shirt is the first T-shirt. The blue shirt is the second T-shirt. The yellow shirt is the third one, and the orange T-shirt is the fourth one.\nThe \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", and \"fourth\" in this case are ordinal numbers. They result from the fact that the person has many objects, and they give them an order (hence 'ordinal'). The person then simply counts those objects, and gives the ordinal numbers to them.\nIn set theory, ordinals are also ordinal numbers people use to order infinite sets. An example is the set formula_1 (or formula_1 for short), which is the set containing all natural numbers (including 0). This is the smallest ordinal number that is infinite, and there are many more (such as formula_1 + 1).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":47},{"uri":"Order","surface_form":"order","offset":77},{"uri":"T-shirt","surface_form":"T-shirt","offset":158},{"uri":"Set_theory","surface_form":"set theory","offset":753},{"uri":"Set_(mathematics)","surface_form":"sets","offset":828},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural numbers","offset":924},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":999}]}
