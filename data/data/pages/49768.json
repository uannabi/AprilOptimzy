{"id":49768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flerovium","text":"Flerovium is a chemical element. It is also named eka-lead. It has the symbol Fl. It has the atomic number 114. It is a superheavy element. Flerovium is radioactive.\nFlerovium does not exist in nature. It has to be made. It is a synthetic element. It is made from a nuclear reaction between plutonium and calcium. The reaction that happens is a fusion reaction.\nHistory.\nThe discovery of Flerovium in December 1998 was reported in January 1999 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. The same team of scientists made another isotope of Uuq three months later and made it again in 2004 and 2006.\nIn 2004 in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research checked it was made by another method. They found the final products of radioactive decay.\nAfter its discovery, the \"new\" element was named \"Ununquadium\". The named changed on May 30th, 2012 to \"Flerovium\". The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry named it so.\nChemical properties.\nNot enough Flerovium has been made to measure its physical or chemical properties. It is thought that it would be a soft, dense metal that changes colour in air. It may have a low melting point of about 200\u00A0\u00B0C.\nMaking it.\nFlerovium can be made by bombarding a plutonium-244 target with calcium-48 as a beam of ions.\n298Fl - An undiscovered neutron-rich nucleus.\nAccording to the nuclear shell model, the undiscovered neutron-rich nucleus 298Fl may be a doubly magic nucleus, atop the shell closure at N=184. It is predicted that this atom, amid the closed nuclear shells, expected to have longer half-lives for alpha decay and spontaneous fission. However using the fusion-evaporation method to produce this nuclide is impractical, since more neutron-rich starting materials with low proton numbers are unstable due to beta decay.\nEstimates for half-lives for this atom range from a few minutes to several billion years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":15},{"uri":"Mendeleev%27s_predicted_elements","surface_form":"eka","offset":50},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":93},{"uri":"Superheavy_element","surface_form":"superheavy element","offset":120},{"uri":"Radioactivity","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":153},{"uri":"Synthetic_element","surface_form":"synthetic element","offset":229},{"uri":"Nuclear_reaction","surface_form":"nuclear reaction","offset":266},{"uri":"Plutonium","surface_form":"plutonium","offset":291},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":305},{"uri":"Nuclear_fusion","surface_form":"fusion","offset":345},{"uri":"Discovery","surface_form":"discovery","offset":375},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":447},{"uri":"Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","surface_form":"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research","offset":465},{"uri":"Dubna","surface_form":"Dubna","offset":505},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":512},{"uri":"Radioactive_decay","surface_form":"radioactive decay","offset":755},{"uri":"International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","surface_form":"International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry","offset":894},{"uri":"Physical_property","surface_form":"physical","offset":1028},{"uri":"Chemical_property","surface_form":"chemical","offset":1040},{"uri":"Tarnish","surface_form":"changes colour","offset":1117},{"uri":"Melting_point","surface_form":"melting point","offset":1158},{"uri":"Bombardment","surface_form":"bombarding","offset":1225},{"uri":"Plutonium","surface_form":"plutonium","offset":1238},{"uri":"Target","surface_form":"target","offset":1252},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":1264},{"uri":"Beam","surface_form":"beam","offset":1280},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":1288}]}
