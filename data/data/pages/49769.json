{"id":49769,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brontosaurus","text":"\"Brontosaurus\" is a genus of sauropod dinosaur.\n\"Brontosaurus\" was originally named by its discoverer Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879. \"Brontosaurus\" had long been considered a junior synonym of \"Apatosaurus\". Its only species was reclassified as \"A. excelsus\" in 1903.\nHowever, an extensive study published in 2015 concluded that \"Brontosaurus\" was a valid genus of sauropod distinct from \"Apatosaurus\".\n\"Brontosaurus\" is a member of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including \"Diplodocus\", \"Supersaurus\", and \"Barosaurus\". \"Brontosaurus\" is closely related to \"Apatosaurus\" in the subfamily Apatosaurinae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":20},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":29},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":38},{"uri":"Othniel_Charles_Marsh","surface_form":"Othniel Charles Marsh","offset":102},{"uri":"Synonym_(taxonomy)","surface_form":"junior synonym","offset":175},{"uri":"Apatosaurus","surface_form":"Apatosaurus","offset":194},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":437},{"uri":"Diplodocidae","surface_form":"Diplodocidae","offset":444},{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"clade","offset":460},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":478},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":487},{"uri":"Diplodocus","surface_form":"Diplodocus","offset":583},{"uri":"Supersaurus","surface_form":"Supersaurus","offset":597},{"uri":"Barosaurus","surface_form":"Barosaurus","offset":616},{"uri":"Apatosaurus","surface_form":"Apatosaurus","offset":667}]}
