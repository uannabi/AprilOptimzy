{"id":497766,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDS_movement","text":"The BDS movement is a campaign to help Palestinians. The letters BDS stand for \"Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions\". They help Palestinians by attempting to put economic and political pressure on Israel. They want an end of Israeli occupation of Palestine. The group thinks that they can create a Palestinian state by boycotting the Israeli government.\nThe movement may be hurting the Palestinian economy while having little overall effect on the Israeli economy. An example is the Israeli-owned soft drink company SodaStream. Hundreds of Palestinians lost good paying jobs in the West Bank when SodaStream moved its factory to southern Israel. SodaStream denied the move was BDS-related but their profits fell after BDS targeted them.\nThe movement has become popular on many US college Campuses. But no US schools have sold any stocks and none are expected to do so. Israel is concerned about the increasing number of American Jews who oppose Israel's policies. Some have even joined BDS campaigns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"campaign","offset":22},{"uri":"Palestinian","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":39},{"uri":"Economic","surface_form":"economic","offset":160},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":195},{"uri":"Occupied_territory","surface_form":"occupation","offset":231},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestine","offset":245},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":396},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":466},{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soft drink","offset":495},{"uri":"SodaStream","surface_form":"SodaStream","offset":514},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":568},{"uri":"West_Bank","surface_form":"West Bank","offset":580},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":616},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":627},{"uri":"Profit","surface_form":"profit","offset":697},{"uri":"Target","surface_form":"target","offset":720},{"uri":"Popular","surface_form":"popular","offset":759},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":775},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":778},{"uri":"Campus","surface_form":"Campus","offset":786},{"uri":"Concern","surface_form":"concern","offset":877},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":927},{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policies","offset":952}]}
