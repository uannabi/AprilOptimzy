{"id":497810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Hates_Us_All","text":"\"God Hates Us All\" is the eighth studio album by American thrash metal band, Slayer. \"God Hates Us All\" was released on September 11, 2001 through American Recordings. Most of the lyrics were written by guitarist Kerry King and cover topics like religion, murder, revenge and self-control. The album was recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada because of the availability for cheaper studio time.\nThe album peaked at #28 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and at #9 on the Canadian Albums Chart. In 2002, the song \"Disciple\" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Metal Performance. It was Slayer's first Grammy nomination.\nBefore Christmas 2001, Paul Bostaph decided to leave the band because of an elbow injury that affected his ability to drum. He would later reveal that the actual reason for him leaving was because \"Musically, I wanted to do something else\". Since Slayer was without a drummer to finish their \"God Hates Us All\" tour, King contacted original drummer Dave Lombardo and asked if he would want to play the remainder of the tour. Lombardo accepted and played the remaining 21 shows. He did not take a permanent position with the band.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":33},{"uri":"Thrash_metal","surface_form":"thrash metal","offset":58},{"uri":"Slayer","surface_form":"Slayer","offset":77},{"uri":"American_Recordings_(record_label)","surface_form":"American Recordings","offset":147},{"uri":"Kerry_King","surface_form":"Kerry King","offset":213},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":246},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":256},{"uri":"Revenge","surface_form":"revenge","offset":264},{"uri":"Self-control","surface_form":"self-control","offset":276},{"uri":"The_Warehouse_Studio","surface_form":"The Warehouse Studio","offset":316},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":340},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":351},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":369},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":460},{"uri":"Canadian_Albums_Chart","surface_form":"Canadian Albums Chart","offset":493},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":565},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Best_Metal_Performance","surface_form":"Best Metal Performance","offset":597},{"uri":"Paul_Bostaph","surface_form":"Paul Bostaph","offset":685},{"uri":"Dave_Lombardo","surface_form":"Dave Lombardo","offset":1011}]}
