But the car escapes much to his disappointment, and seeing that the car is able to float and move like a speedboat on the sea, he sabotages the Potts' home by air and kidnaps Grandfather Potts, mistaking him for the inventor of Chitty.\nLater, when the Potts follow Bomburst's airship to his native Vulgaria, they discover how cruelly the Baron treats his subjects. Although it is stated that \"the Baroness hates children\" and that it is the Baroness who sends for the Child Catcher, it's obvious that the Baron himself hates children as well, and his greed is evident all the more when it is revealed that all the toys made by Vulgaria's toymaker are for him.\nBaron Bomburst is last seen when a huge battle occurs in his castle by an ambush lead by Caractacus Potts, Bomburst's loyal servant The Toymaker, the children of the villagers, and Truly Scrumptious.

Realizing the Child Catcher is defeated Baroness suggests escaping down a slide.

The Villagers help battle the Cavalry and Bomburst gets defeated in the battle. With the Baron and Baroness defeated the Cavalry retreats the battle in terror. Though Vulgaria then becomes a free country, it is completely unknown what happened to the Bomburst couple afterwards, but as they did not execute any kid, it is highly likely that they were not executed for their crimes and were either exiled or send to the very dungeons\nJeremy and Jeremiah Potts got captured by the child catcher, who was disguised as an ice cream man They, along with their father, the toy maker and Truly Scrumptious finally capturing the Child Catcher.
