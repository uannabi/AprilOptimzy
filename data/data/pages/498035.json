It is the type species of its genus and is closely related to \"Bacillus\" species. It lives in the soil. It is able to break down urea. Therefore, the name (Latin: \"urea\"). The cells are coccoid. It has some flagella. \"Sporosarcina ureae\" is heterotrophic.

It is often found in soils where are large amounts of urine like meadows where cows are kept. It is also found in manure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":37},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":57},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":77},{"uri":"Bacillus","surface_form":"Bacillus","offset":110},{"uri":"Urea","surface_form":"urea","offset":176},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":203},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":223},{"uri":"Coccus","surface_form":"coccoid","offset":233},{"uri":"Flagellum","surface_form":"flagella","offset":254},{"uri":"Heterotroph","surface_form":"heterotroph","offset":288},{"uri":"Aerobic","surface_form":"aerobic","offset":309},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":327},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":427},{"uri":"Urease","surface_form":"urease","offset":434},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":496},{"uri":"Meadow","surface_form":"meadow","offset":507},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":521},{"uri":"Manure","surface_form":"manure","offset":556}]}
