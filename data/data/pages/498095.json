{"id":498095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4agen-Dazs","text":"H\u00E4agen-Dazs is a brand of ice cream shops and ice cream franchises. They specialize in ice cream cones, ice cream cups, and ice cream shakes. They have franchises in the United States and many other countries around the world. H\u00E4agen-Dazs was created in 1961 by Reuben and Rose Mattus in The Bronx, New York. They opened their first store on November 15, 1976 in Brooklyn.\nThe \"H\u00E4agen-Dazs\" name was invented by Mattus since it was \"Danish-sounding\". He used it as a tribute to Denmark's good treatment of Jews during World War II. An outline of Denmark was also used on their early labels. The name is not Danish.\nIn 1983, H\u00E4agen-Dazs was bought by Pillsbury. Pillsbury was then bought by General Mills in 2001.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_cream","surface_form":"ice cream","offset":26},{"uri":"The_Bronx","surface_form":"The Bronx","offset":288},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":299},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":363},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":478},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":506},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":518},{"uri":"Pillsbury_Company","surface_form":"Pillsbury","offset":650},{"uri":"General_Mills","surface_form":"General Mills","offset":690}]}
