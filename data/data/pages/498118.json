{"id":498118,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula","text":"The word fistula comes from a Latin word that means tube or pipe. In medicine, a fistula is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces. This can be blood vessels, intestines, or other hollow organs. Fistulas are usually caused by injury or surgery. But they can also result from an infection or inflammation. Fistulas are generally a disease condition, but doctors may create fistulas by surgery for medical reasons.\nTreatment.\nTreatment for fistula depends on the reason for the fistula and on how serious it is. Doctors often treat fistula with surgery and antibiotics. The first step in treating a fistula is usually an examination by a doctor. The doctor determines the size and \"path\" that the fistula takes in the body.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":30},{"uri":"Tube","surface_form":"tube","offset":52},{"uri":"Pipe","surface_form":"pipe","offset":60},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":69},{"uri":"Abnormal","surface_form":"abnormal","offset":95},{"uri":"Connection","surface_form":"connection","offset":104},{"uri":"Hollow","surface_form":"hollow","offset":127},{"uri":"Blood_vessel","surface_form":"blood vessels","offset":154},{"uri":"Intestine","surface_form":"intestine","offset":169},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":197},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injury","offset":236},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":246},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":288},{"uri":"Inflammation","surface_form":"inflammation","offset":301},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":340},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":363},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":394},{"uri":"Medical","surface_form":"medical","offset":406},{"uri":"Treatment","surface_form":"Treatment","offset":434},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":565},{"uri":"Examination","surface_form":"examination","offset":629}]}
