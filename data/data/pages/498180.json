{"id":498180,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexting","text":"Sexting is the act of sending sexually suggestive electronic messages, mainly between mobile phones. The term became popular during the early 21st century. The term is a portmanteau of \"sex\" and \"texting\".\nThe term was first used in print in 2005 in Australia. A naked picture that you make of yourself is sometimes called a nelfie, a mix of the words naked and selfie.\nIf adults exchange such pictures, this is not a problem. The problem starts when children do this: The image of a teenager or child with little clothes may be child pornography. Many countries have laws against child pornography. This usually includes penalties for owning or spreading such images.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronic_message","surface_form":"electronic message","offset":50},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":86},{"uri":"Portmanteau_word","surface_form":"portmanteau","offset":170},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":186},{"uri":"Texting","surface_form":"texting","offset":196},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":250},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenager","offset":484},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":496},{"uri":"Child_pornography","surface_form":"child pornography","offset":529}]}
