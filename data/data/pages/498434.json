Marram specialises in being the first line of land plants in coastal sand dunes.\n\"Ammophila\" has roots up to metres long. They find the moisture below the dry sand. These plants are used to stop sand-blow, because their roots hold the sand, and stop the wind blowing it away.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":31},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":40},{"uri":"Xerophyte","surface_form":"xerophyte","offset":58},{"uri":"Coastal","surface_form":"coastal","offset":157},{"uri":"Sand_dunes","surface_form":"sand dunes","offset":165}]}
