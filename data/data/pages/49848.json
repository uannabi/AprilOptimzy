The islands have a population of 1,650. They are the only German islands not nearby to the mainland and are about two hours' sailing time from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe.\nGeography.\nHeligoland is located 70 km (44 miles) from the German coast line and actually consists of two islands: the populated triangular-shaped 1 km\u00B2 (0.4 sq mi) main island () to the west and the island of \"D\u00FCne\" (Heligolandic: \"de Halem\") in the east.\nD\u00FCne is the smaller of the two islands(0.7 km\u00B2). It is also lower, surrounded by sand beaches and no-one lives on the island throughout the year.\nOften when people talk about \"Heligoland\" they only mean Hauptinsel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["German location"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":26},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":57},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":95},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British","offset":136},{"uri":"Cuxhaven","surface_form":"Cuxhaven","offset":288},{"uri":"Elbe","surface_form":"Elbe","offset":323},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"km","offset":365},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":372},{"uri":"Km%C2%B2","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":478},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"sq mi","offset":487}]}
