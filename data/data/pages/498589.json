{"id":498589,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_DNA","text":"e=\"preserve\">Satellite DNA has many sections of repeating, non-coding DNA.\nSatellite DNA is a type of tandem repeat. The repeats sit next to each other, in tandem. These are multiple copies of the same base-pair sequence lying end-to-end. Tandem repeats also include minisatellite and microsatellite DNA.\nSatellite DNA is the main component of centromeres. It forms the main part of heterochromatin.\nThe most common type of tandem repeat is the heterochromatin, which sits on chromosomes around the centromeres and elsewhere. It is \"transcriptionally inactive\", meaning, it does not code for proteins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Non-coding_DNA","surface_form":"non-coding DNA","offset":59},{"uri":"Tandem_repeat","surface_form":"tandem repeat","offset":102},{"uri":"Base-pair","surface_form":"base-pair","offset":202},{"uri":"Centromeres","surface_form":"centromeres","offset":344},{"uri":"Heterochromatin","surface_form":"heterochromatin","offset":383},{"uri":"Heterochromatin","surface_form":"heterochromatin","offset":445},{"uri":"Chromosomes","surface_form":"chromosomes","offset":476}]}
