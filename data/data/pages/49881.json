After being wounded and recovered in 1942, he went working at the Race and Resettlement Office in Berlin. In 1943 he volunteered for concentration camp Auschwitz.\nHe conducted medical experiments on the people in the camps. Many people died as a consequence of these experiments. The experiments included freezing and placing subjects under heat lamps.\nMengele was also known for his studies and fascination with twins. Mengele was known as the \"Angel of Death.\"\nAfter the war, he first hid in Germany, then escaped and lived in South America, until he drowned in Brazil.\nMengele wrote a thesis, which he finished in 1936. His advisor was Theodor Mollison. His assumption was that is was possible to determine the race of a human being by looking at the jawbone. He wrote another thesis, in a related area in 1938. In 1960 and 1961, his title was revoked, because of the crimes he had committed in Auschwitz.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":56},{"uri":"Schutzstaffel","surface_form":"SS officer","offset":63},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":80},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":97},{"uri":"Concentration_camp","surface_form":"concentration camp","offset":102},{"uri":"Auschwitz","surface_form":"Auschwitz","offset":121},{"uri":"Waffen-SS","surface_form":"Waffen-SS","offset":214},{"uri":"Medical","surface_form":"medical","offset":401},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":409},{"uri":"Twin","surface_form":"twin","offset":638},{"uri":"Angel_of_Death","surface_form":"Angel of Death","offset":671},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":754},{"uri":"Drowning","surface_form":"drowned","offset":778},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":789},{"uri":"Theodor_Mollison","surface_form":"Theodor Mollison","offset":864},{"uri":"Jawbone","surface_form":"jawbone","offset":979}]}
