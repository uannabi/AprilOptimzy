Ky\u016Bsh\u016B was made of nine old \"countries\" or provinces that are now prefectures. In other words, each prefecture has a modern name and sometimes more than one old provincial name. The old names are still used sometimes, especially for foods, music, or art.\nThe original nine provinces in Kyushu were Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen, Higo, Buzen, Bungo, Hy\u016Bga, \u014Csumi, and Satsuma.\nToday, Kyushu is made up of seven prefectures.\nParts of Ky\u016Bsh\u016B have a warm climate, like the Miyazaki and Kagoshima regions. Major crops grown there are rice, tea, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and soy; silk is also made. The island is known for many types of porcelain like Arita, Imari, Satsuma and Karatsu.\nUnder the Gokishichid\u014D system, the island of Ky\u016Bsh\u016B was a part of the region known as Saikaid\u014D. It was a part of this region from the 7th century until the middle of the 1800s. Around 1905, it was made into its own region.
