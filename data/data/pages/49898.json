{"id":49898,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(software)","text":"Keynote is a presentation software application made by Apple for its Mac OS X operating system.\nHistory.\nKeynote was a software program that Steve Jobs, the chief executive officer of Apple used for his own presentations only. It was later sold to everyone as Keynote 1.0, competing against other presentation software, especially Microsoft PowerPoint. Unlike PowerPoint, Keynote can use all image types, and the design uses more pictures, making it easier to use. Because Keynote uses Mac OS X's built-in graphics technologies, it can produce slides with many graphics very easily.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Presentation_program","surface_form":"presentation software","offset":13},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple","offset":55},{"uri":"Mac_OS_X","surface_form":"Mac OS X","offset":69},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":78},{"uri":"Steve_Jobs","surface_form":"Steve Jobs","offset":141},{"uri":"Chief_executive_officer","surface_form":"chief executive officer","offset":157},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple","offset":184},{"uri":"Presentation","surface_form":"presentation","offset":207},{"uri":"Microsoft_PowerPoint","surface_form":"Microsoft PowerPoint","offset":331},{"uri":"Mac_OS_X","surface_form":"Mac OS X","offset":486},{"uri":"Graphics","surface_form":"graphics","offset":506}]}
