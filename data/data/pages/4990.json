{"id":4990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Liberalism is a way of thinking about politics and government.\nWhat liberals believe.\nSome liberals believe that freedom is impossible without equality, and that governments should promote egalitarianism by providing education and health care supported by taxes. Other liberals believe that taxes are bad, and that people should provide their own education and health care; these people are usually called libertarians today. Most liberal governments today do provide at least some education and health care, though not necessarily equally for all citizens.\nThe philosophy of liberalism.\nIn the old days, kings or queens told people what to do (a form of government called a Monarchy), and there was very little freedom. A few hundred years ago, philosophers such as John Locke, Sim\u00F3n Bol\u00EDvar, John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham began to write about freedom. Earlier writers, such as Marcus Aurelius, had written about freedom, but this time the idea caught on. The United States of America was the first country to have a constitution which was based on the ideas of John Locke which were similar to those of Mill and Bentham, and which guaranteed certain rights to all citizens, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the right to assemble (get together in groups), the right to bear arms (weapons), and the right to ask their government to take action (right of petition) or to remove from office rulers they did not like (right of referendum).\nAnother idea that became popular around this time was the idea of free trade. A leading philosopher who promoted free trade was Adam Smith.\nLiberalism today.\nMost of the wealthy countries in the world today are liberal democracies with more or less free trade. An exception to this rule are the oil-rich countries, not all of which are liberal or democratic. Most of the poor countries in the world are dictatorships, with heavy restrictions on trade. China is a poor country which is rapidly becoming rich, and is trying the experiment of combining dictatorship with free trade. Whether it is possible to have the advantages of free trade without other freedoms remains to be seen.\nLiberalism around the world.\nWhile all liberal governments support free elections, other ideas of liberal government vary a great deal from country to country. For information about liberalism in a particular country, look for an article called \"Liberalism in...\" and then the name of the country.\nUnited States.\nLiberals in the United States are also sometimes called \"Progressives\". The biggest liberal political party in the United States is the Democratic Party. But the Green Party is seen to be more 'left', or liberal than the Democrats.\nAustralia.\nLiberals in Australia have many different ideas about government than liberals in the United States. Most liberals in Australia believe that government should not increase taxes, and would like a government that has lower taxes and less power over the economy. The main liberal political party in Australia is the Liberal Party of Australia. The Liberal Party also believes that government should support traditional values and morals, something which many conservatives believe as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":51},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":64},{"uri":"Equality","surface_form":"equality","offset":156},{"uri":"Egalitarianism","surface_form":"egalitarianism","offset":202},{"uri":"Libertarianism","surface_form":"libertarians","offset":419},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"Monarchy","offset":688},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":759},{"uri":"John_Locke","surface_form":"John Locke","offset":780},{"uri":"Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar","surface_form":"Sim\u00F3n Bol\u00EDvar","offset":792},{"uri":"John_Stuart_Mill","surface_form":"John Stuart Mill","offset":807},{"uri":"Jeremy_Bentham","surface_form":"Jeremy Bentham","offset":828},{"uri":"Marcus_Aurelius","surface_form":"Marcus Aurelius","offset":898},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":980},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":1037},{"uri":"John_Locke","surface_form":"John Locke","offset":1082},{"uri":"Free_trade","surface_form":"free trade","offset":1561},{"uri":"Adam_Smith","surface_form":"Adam Smith","offset":1623},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":2583},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":2627},{"uri":"Green_Party","surface_form":"Green Party","offset":2653},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":2746},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":2986},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Liberal Party of Australia","offset":3048},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservatives","offset":3191}]}
