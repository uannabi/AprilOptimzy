People that say militarism is good are called \"militarists\".\nMost important to militarists is discipline. Discipline means to follow a set of rules.\nIt also means training that follows such rules. A strong military is good for discipline.\nThere are many areas where moral goals and the culture of the military can be applied. Most notable are private business, government, education and entertainment.\nMilitarism is related to militarization.\nMilitarist countries often have a strong military.\nSparta in Ancient Greece, Prussia in the 19th century was militarist, for example. North Korea is a good example in modern times. In militarised societies the military either run the government, or have heavy military influence. Often the head of state is a military person, though that does not always mean the society is militarised.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":60},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":104},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":186},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":195},{"uri":"Discipline","surface_form":"discipline","offset":324},{"uri":"Moral","surface_form":"moral","offset":496},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":581},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":591},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":603},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":617},{"uri":"Militarization","surface_form":"militarization","offset":657},{"uri":"Sparta","surface_form":"Sparta","offset":724},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":750},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":765},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":807},{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":963}]}
