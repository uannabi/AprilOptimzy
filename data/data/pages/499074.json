{"id":499074,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashmolean_Museum","text":"The Ashmolean Museum (in full the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology) on Beaumont Street, Oxford, is the world's first university museum.\nIts first building was built in 1678\u20131683 to house the cabinet of curiosities that Elias Ashmole gave to the University of Oxford in 1677. The museum reopened in 2009 after a major redevelopment. In November 2011 new galleries focusing on Egypt and Nubia were also unveiled.\nAshmole's collection was based on the objects he got from the travellers and collectors John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name.\nThe museum opened on 24 May 1683, with naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper.\nThe present building dates from the 1840s, and the original building in Broad Street is now the Oxford Museum of the History of Science. That building is the world's first purpose-built museum.\nThe interior of the Ashmolean has been extensively modernised in recent years. Between 2006 and 2009, the museum was expanded. The $98.2 million rebuilding resulted in five floors instead of three, with a doubling of the display space. It has new conservation studios and an education centre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":95},{"uri":"Elias_Ashmole","surface_form":"Elias Ashmole","offset":226},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"University of Oxford","offset":252},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":382},{"uri":"Nubia","surface_form":"Nubia","offset":392},{"uri":"John_Tradescant_the_elder","surface_form":"John Tradescant the elder","offset":506},{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":601},{"uri":"Robert_Plot","surface_form":"Robert Plot","offset":612}]}
