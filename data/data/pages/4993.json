The roots often look like man or woman, or can be easily made to resemble them. The plant has been used in witchcraft for a long time.\nAccording to this literature, the plant shrieks in pain, when it is pulled from the ground. This shriek is able to make a person deaf. He might also lose his mind, or even be killed, if he is unprotected.\nMandrake (Mandragora officinalis) has been used as an anaestethic for a long time. For this, it was usually prepared in an alcoholic solution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":23},{"uri":"Mandriva_Linux","surface_form":"Mandriva Linux","offset":42},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":101},{"uri":"Nightshade","surface_form":"Nightshade","offset":115},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":126},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":134},{"uri":"Man","surface_form":"man","offset":178},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":185},{"uri":"Witchcraft","surface_form":"witchcraft","offset":259},{"uri":"Anaestesia","surface_form":"anaestethic","offset":546},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":615}]}
