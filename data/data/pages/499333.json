{"id":499333,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Wakefield","text":"The Division of Wakefield was an Australian electoral division in the state of South Australia. It covered an area from the northern suburbs of Adelaide to the Clare Valley, 135 km north of Adelaide. It includes the suburbs of Elizabeth, Craigmore, Munno Para, Virginia, and part of Salisbury, and the towns of Gawler, Balaklava, Clare, Kapunda, Riverton, Mallala, Freeling, Tarlee, Williamstown, and parts of Port Wakefield.\nThe Division was named after Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who planned settlements in South Australia, Western Australia, New Zealand and Canada. It was set up in 1903. It was abolished in 2019 when a redistribution cut the number of divisions in South Australia to ten.\nMembers.\nSir Frederick Holder and Neil Andrew (1998\u20132004) were Speaker of the House. Holder was also Premier of South Australia on two occasions. Holder's death in 1909 caused a by-election. In 1938 the death of Charles Hawker also caused another by-election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian electoral division","offset":33},{"uri":"States_and_territories_of_Australia","surface_form":"state","offset":70},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":79},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":144},{"uri":"Clare_Valley","surface_form":"Clare Valley","offset":160},{"uri":"Elizabeth%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Elizabeth","offset":227},{"uri":"Craigmore%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Craigmore","offset":238},{"uri":"Munno_Para%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Munno Para","offset":249},{"uri":"Virginia%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":261},{"uri":"Salisbury%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Salisbury","offset":283},{"uri":"Gawler%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Gawler","offset":311},{"uri":"Balaklava%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Balaklava","offset":319},{"uri":"Clare%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Clare","offset":330},{"uri":"Kapunda%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Kapunda","offset":337},{"uri":"Riverton%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Riverton","offset":346},{"uri":"Mallala%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Mallala","offset":356},{"uri":"Freeling%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Freeling","offset":365},{"uri":"Tarlee%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Tarlee","offset":375},{"uri":"Williamstown%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Williamstown","offset":383},{"uri":"Port_Wakefield%2C_South_Australia","surface_form":"Port Wakefield","offset":410},{"uri":"Edward_Gibbon_Wakefield","surface_form":"Edward Gibbon Wakefield","offset":455},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":524},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":543},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":559},{"uri":"Frederick_Holder","surface_form":"Frederick Holder","offset":705},{"uri":"Neil_Andrew","surface_form":"Neil Andrew","offset":726},{"uri":"Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Speaker of the House.","offset":755},{"uri":"Premier_of_South_Australia","surface_form":"Premier of South Australia","offset":793},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":870}]}
