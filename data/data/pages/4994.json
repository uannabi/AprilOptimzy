{"id":4994,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian","text":"Debian is a free operating system. It is a distribution of an operating system known as the GNU operating system, which can be used with various kernels, including Linux, kFreeBSD, and Hurd. In combination with these kernels, the operating system can be referred to as Debian GNU/Linux, Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, and Debian GNU/Hurd, respectively. Debian GNU/Linux is one of the most complete and popular Linux distributions, on which many others, like Ubuntu, are based.\nBrief history.\nThe Debian Project officially started on August 16th, 1993, led by Ian Murdock. He was a computer programmer. Today, in this project, Debian is developed by more than 1,000 computer specialists all over the world.\nThe name \"Debian\" was taken after Ian Murdock and his wife Debra. Some people say or pronounce 'deb-ee-n' but others also say 'de-bi-an' or 'de-bai-an' and in Japan 'de-bi-a-n' and so on.\nDevelopment steps.\nSoftware packages in development are either uploaded to the project distribution named \"unstable\" (also known as \"sid\"), or to the \"experimental\" repository. Software packages uploaded to \"unstable\" are normally versions stable enough to be released by the original upstream developer, but with the added Debian-specific packaging and other modifications introduced by Debian developers. These additions may be new and untested. Software not ready yet for the \"unstable\" distribution is typically placed in the \"experimental\" repository.\nAfter a version of a software package has remained in \"unstable\" for a certain length of time (depending on how urgent the changes are), that package is automatically moved to the \"testing\" distribution. The package's move to testing happens only if no serious (\"release-critical\") bugs in the package are reported and if other software needed for package functionality qualifies for inclusion in \"testing\".\nSince updates to Debian software packages between official releases do not contain new features, some choose to use the \"testing\" and \"unstable\" distributions for their newer packages. However, these distributions are less tested than \"stable\", and \"unstable\" does not receive timely security updates. In particular, incautious upgrades to working \"unstable\" packages can sometimes seriously break software functionality. Since September 9, 2005 the \"testing\" distributions security updates have been provided by the \"testing\" security team.\nAfter the packages in \"testing\" have matured and the goals for the next release are met, the \"testing\" distribution becomes the next stable release. The latest stable release of Debian (\"Buster\") is 10.0, released on July 6, 2019. The next release is codenamed \"Bullseye\".\nRelease history.\nDue to an incident involving a CD vendor who made an unofficial and broken release labeled \"1.0\", an official 1.0 release was never made.\nFor other platforms.\nDebian has been ported to different architectures or platforms. One version, which is based on the developer release (sid) that has been ported to the Xbox is called Xebian.\nPackage.\nDebian's official software package repository includes, for example, UNetbootin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":17},{"uri":"GNU","surface_form":"GNU operating system","offset":92},{"uri":"Linux_kernel","surface_form":"Linux","offset":164},{"uri":"FreeBSD","surface_form":"kFreeBSD","offset":171},{"uri":"GNU_Hurd","surface_form":"Hurd","offset":185},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux distributions","offset":400},{"uri":"Ubuntu","surface_form":"Ubuntu","offset":448},{"uri":"Ian_Murdock","surface_form":"Ian Murdock","offset":549},{"uri":"Computer_programmer","surface_form":"computer programmer","offset":571},{"uri":"Upstream_(software_development)","surface_form":"upstream","offset":1169},{"uri":"Xbox_(console)","surface_form":"Xbox","offset":2991},{"uri":"UNetbootin","surface_form":"UNetbootin","offset":3092}]}
