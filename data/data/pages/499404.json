For the first time ever, I was involved (in writing) in eight of the 10 cuts, so it's a huge reflection of myself. It's the things I enjoy singing about. I got to sing about the band on the road, I got to sing about cowboys, and more importantly, the women who put up with those cowboys.\nTrack listing.\n\u201CThe Limited Series\u201D (1998) of the album inserted a cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201CTo Make You Feel My Love\u201D between tracks 7 and 8.\nChart performance.\n\"Fresh Horses\" peaked at #2 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200, and peaked #1 on the Top Country Albums, becoming his sixth #1 Country album.
