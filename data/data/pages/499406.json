This is the result of that effort, a real labor of love, that I'm proud to hold up next to all of our previous releases. For the first time in my life I think I made a happy album. It's heavy on steel guitars, but you're not aware of it in some places because the musicians are so good at what they do.\"\nContent.\nSingles released from this album include \"Beer Run (B Double E Double Are You In?)\" (a duet with George Jones, also found on Jones's 2001 album '), \"Wrapped Up in You\", \"Squeeze Me In\" (a duet with Trisha Yearwood), \"Thicker Than Blood\", and \"Why Ain't I Running\".
