{"id":49955,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint","text":"Microsoft Office PowerPoint is a presentation program developed for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS computer operating systems. Businesspeople, educators, and trainers use it often. It is a component of the Microsoft Office system.\nOperation.\nIn PowerPoint, as in most other presentation software, text, graphics, movies, and other objects are positioned on individual pages or \"slides\". The \"slide\" analogy is a reference to the slide projector. Slides can be printed, or (more often) displayed on-screen and navigated through at the command of the presenter. Slides can also form the basis of webcasts.\nVersions.\n\"Note: There is no PowerPoint 5.0 or 6.0, because the Windows 95 version was launched with Word 7. All of the Office 95 products have OLE 2 - moving data between many programs - and PowerPoint 7 shows that it was as new as Word 7.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Software |"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Presentation_software","surface_form":"presentation program","offset":33},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":72},{"uri":"Mac_OS","surface_form":"Mac OS","offset":94},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":110},{"uri":"Microsoft_Office","surface_form":"Microsoft Office","offset":208},{"uri":"Slide_projector","surface_form":"slide projector","offset":431},{"uri":"Webcasts","surface_form":"webcasts","offset":596},{"uri":"Object_Linking_and_Embedding","surface_form":"OLE","offset":750},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"data","offset":765}]}
