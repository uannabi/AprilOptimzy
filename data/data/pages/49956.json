It take places on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month and often goes into August on the Gregorian calendar.\nThe story of Cowherd and Weaver Girl.\nLong, long ago, there was an honest and kind-hearted fellow named Niulang (Cowherd). His parents died when he was a child. Later, he was driven out of his home by his sister-in-law. So he lived by himself herding cattle and farming. One day, a fairy from heaven named Zhin\u00FC (Weaver Girl) fell in love with him. She secretly came down to earth and married him. Niulang farmed in the field and Zhin\u00FC wove at home. They lived a happy life and gave birth to a boy and a girl. Unfortunately, the God of Heaven soon found this out and ordered the Queen Mother of the Western Heavens to bring Zhin\u00FC back.\nWith the help of celestial cattle, Niulang flew to heaven with his son and daughter. When he was about to catch up with his wife, the Queen Mother took off one of her gold hairpins and scratched a river in the sky to separate the lovers. Niulang and Zhin\u00FC have been separated on the two banks ever since. Once a year all of the magpies in the world come to build a bridge for Niulang and Zhin\u00FC to meet each other. This meeting happens on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month. Because of this, their meeting is called \"Qi Xi\" (Double Seventh).\nHistory.\nScholars have shown the Double Seventh Festival originated from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). Historical documents from the Eastern Jin Dynasty (AD 371-420) mention the festival, while records from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) depict the grand evening banquet of Emperor Taizong and his concubines. By the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties, special articles for the Qi Xi were seen being sold on markets in the capital. The bustling markets demonstrated the significance of the festival.\nTraditional celebrations.\nToday some traditional customs are still observed in rural areas of China, but have been weakened or diluted in urban cities.\nIn the past, Qi Xi was not only a special day for lovers, but also for girls. It has been known as the \"Begging for Skills Festival\" or \"Daughters' Festival.\"\nIn the past, girls would conduct a ceremony to beg Zhin\u00FC for wisdom, dexterity and a satisfying marriage in the future.\nIn some parts of the Shandong Province, young women offered fruit and pastries to pray for a bright mind. If spiders were seen to weave webs on sacrificial objects, it was believed the Weaving Girl was offering positive feedback.\nIn other regions, seven close friends would gather to make dumplings. They put into three separate dumplings a needle, a copper coin and a red date, which represented perfect needlework skills, good fortune and an early marriage.\nGirls also held weaving and needlework competitions to see who had the best hands and the brightest mind, both important to being a good wife and mother in ancient China. Young women in southern China used to weave small handicrafts with colored paper, grass and thread. Afterwards, they competed to pass a thread through the eyes of seven needles in a single breath.\nJapan.\nThe Japanese version of Qi Xi is called \"Tanabata\". It is held on July 7th. On the evening of the 7th, slips of paper are hung on bamboo trees. The notes contain desires that the person hopes will be fulfilled.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Valentine%27s_Day","surface_form":"Valentine's Day","offset":45},{"uri":"Romance_(love)","surface_form":"romantic","offset":127},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":136},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":148},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":242},{"uri":"Sister-in-law","surface_form":"sister-in-law","offset":467},{"uri":"Magpie","surface_form":"magpie","offset":1226},{"uri":"Han_Dynasty","surface_form":"Han Dynasty","offset":1516},{"uri":"Jin_Dynasty","surface_form":"Jin Dynasty","offset":1583},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang Dynasty","offset":1653},{"uri":"Song_Dynasty","surface_form":"Song","offset":1755},{"uri":"Yuan_Dynasty","surface_form":"Yuan","offset":1775},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"Skill","offset":2218},{"uri":"Dumpling","surface_form":"dumpling","offset":2670}]}
