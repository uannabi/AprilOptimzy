{"id":499663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography","text":"Radiography is the name for the use of X-rays to see what is happening to parts of the body. It is an imaging technique which uses electromagnetic radiation other than light, usually X-rays.\nTo create the image, a beam of X-rays is produced by an X-ray machine and is projected toward the object. A certain amount of X-ray is absorbed by the object, which is dependent on the density and composition of that object. The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic film or a digital detector). The detector gives a superimposed 2D representation of the object's internal structures.\nTomography.\nTomography is a more advanced way of using X-rays. In tomography, the machine blurs out structures not in the focal plane. This gives a series of pictures, like a set of slices through the body. It is called CT scanning, or computer tomography. The computer builds a 3-D picture for the expert to look at.\nRadiography has many medical and industrial uses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"X-rays","surface_form":"X-rays","offset":39},{"uri":"Imaging_technology","surface_form":"imaging technique","offset":102},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_radiation","surface_form":"electromagnetic radiation","offset":131},{"uri":"Visible_spectrum","surface_form":"light","offset":168},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":183},{"uri":"X-ray_machine","surface_form":"X-ray machine","offset":247},{"uri":"Photographic_film","surface_form":"photographic film","offset":509},{"uri":"X-ray_detector","surface_form":"digital detector","offset":532},{"uri":"Tomography","surface_form":"tomography","offset":706},{"uri":"Focal_plane","surface_form":"focal plane","offset":762}]}
