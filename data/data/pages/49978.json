{"id":49978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm","text":"A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a collection into a certain order. Most commonly, numbers are sorted by their value, and words are sorted by their lexicographic order (as they would appear in a dictionary or phone book). Efficient sorting is important for other things: finding an element in a sorted collection is easier, and merging a new element may also be easier if the collection is sorted.\nSorting needs to take different into account that in some cases, the data can only be read sequentially, like on a tape.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":26}]}
