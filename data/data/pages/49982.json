{"id":49982,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciao","text":"The word \"ciao\" is a greeting in Italian. It is used for both \"hello\" and \"goodbye\". It is less formal than other greetings in Italian, such as \"buongiorno\" or \"salve\".\nThe word originally comes from the Venetian language. It is also sometimes used by English speakers and speakers of other languages around the world. Other words that mean both \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" are \"shalom\" in Hebrew, \"salaam\" in Arabic, \"annyeong\" in Korean, and \"aloha\" in Hawaiian. In Vietnamese, the word \"ch\u00E0o\" also means \"hello\" or \"goodbye\". It sounds similar, but is not related to the Italian word.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greeting","surface_form":"greeting","offset":21},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":33},{"uri":"Hello","surface_form":"hello","offset":63},{"uri":"Goodbye","surface_form":"goodbye","offset":75},{"uri":"Formal","surface_form":"formal","offset":96},{"uri":"Venetian_language","surface_form":"Venetian language","offset":204},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":252},{"uri":"Shalom","surface_form":"shalom","offset":373},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":384},{"uri":"Salaam","surface_form":"salaam","offset":393},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":404},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":426},{"uri":"Aloha","surface_form":"aloha","offset":439},{"uri":"Hawaiian_language","surface_form":"Hawaiian","offset":449},{"uri":"Vietnamese_language","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":462}]}
