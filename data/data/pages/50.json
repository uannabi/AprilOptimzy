{"id":50,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy","text":"Anatomy is the study of the bodies of people and other animals. Anatomy is the study of the inside of the body and outside the body. Anatomy notes the position and structure of organs such as muscles, glands and bones. A person who studies anatomy is an anatomist.\nThe history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BC when Egyptians began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.\nFor long periods the dissection of deceased people was forbidden, and correct ideas about human anatomy was a long time coming.\nAcademic human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools and teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching, and research. Gross anatomy studies parts of the body that are big enough to see. Micro-anatomy studies smaller parts.\nBody systems.\nThere are different organ system<nowiki/>s, such as the cardiovascular system, also known as the circulatory system (the system that gets blood around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains muscles), the nervous system (the system that controls the nerves,and the brain) and the skeleton (the bones).\nAnatomy, physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"study","offset":15},{"uri":"Bodies","surface_form":"bodies","offset":28},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscles","offset":192},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"glands","offset":201},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bones","offset":212},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":307},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Egyptians","offset":315},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":409},{"uri":"Spleen","surface_form":"spleen","offset":416},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidneys","offset":424},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":433},{"uri":"Lymphatic_system","surface_form":"lymphatic system","offset":510},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"Academic","offset":656},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":706},{"uri":"Medical_school","surface_form":"medical schools","offset":720},{"uri":"Micro-anatomy","surface_form":"Micro-anatomy","offset":879},{"uri":"Organ_system","surface_form":"organ system","offset":950},{"uri":"Cardiovascular_system","surface_form":"cardiovascular system","offset":986},{"uri":"Circulatory_system","surface_form":"circulatory system","offset":1027},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":1068},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":1138},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":1152},{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerve","offset":1197},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":1227},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiology","offset":1258},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":1273}]}
