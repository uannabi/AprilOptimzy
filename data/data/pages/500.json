{"id":500,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache","text":"The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is called a mustache. The hair that grows on the sides of the face and the chin of some men is called a beard. Some men have a lot of hair and a big mustache, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men shave part or all of their mustaches, or cut their mustache so it does not get very long. A chin beard with no mustache is called a goatee, whilst a chin beard with a mustache is known as a Van Dyke.\nMustache in United Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations is spelled moustache.\nSome animals such as walruses also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a mustache.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lip","surface_form":"lip","offset":33},{"uri":"Face","surface_form":"face","offset":111},{"uri":"Chin","surface_form":"chin","offset":124},{"uri":"Beard","surface_form":"beard","offset":153},{"uri":"Shave","surface_form":"shave","offset":265},{"uri":"Beard","surface_form":"beard","offset":362},{"uri":"Goatee","surface_form":"goatee","offset":397},{"uri":"Beard","surface_form":"beard","offset":419},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":477},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth of Nations","offset":496},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":547},{"uri":"Walrus","surface_form":"walrus","offset":563}]}
