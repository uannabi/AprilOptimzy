{"id":5000,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia","text":"The Republic of Serbia (Serbian: \"\u0420\u0435\u043F\u0443\u0431\u043B\u0438\u043A\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430\" / Republika Srbija), or usually just Serbia (Serbian: \"\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430\" / Srbija), is a country in Central Europe. The capital city is Belgrade. To the north of Serbia is the country Hungary. To the east of Serbia are the countries Bulgaria and Romania. To the south of Serbia are countries North Macedonia and Kosovo. To the west of Serbia are the countries Montenegro (the country that was once united with Serbia), Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.\nHistory.\nThe oldest form of writing comes from an ancient civilization which inhabited Serbia called the Vin\u010Da culture and the symbols are called the Vin\u010Da script. Serbia is also home to the earliest known copper smelting sites and the birth of the Copper Age which lead humanity out of the Stone Age and into regular use of metallurgy. The same culture contains the earliest evidence of tin alloy bronze which replaced the much weaker arsenic bronze.\nMedieval history.\nWhite Serbs, an early Slavic tribe from Northern Europe, came to Northern Greece in the 6th century. By the 8th century they had created the Serbian Principality, a Serbian country, in the Balkans. The Serbs became Christian around the 10th century. For 200 years, the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty ruled. They made Serbia a kingdom, built new towns, monasteries, and forts, and made Serbia bigger. In 1371 the Nemanjic Dynasty died out. Serbia became unsafe and local leaders fought each other for control. In 1389 the Ottoman Empire invaded Serbia. They fought against Serbia, Bosnia, the Knights Hospitaller, and the forces of many other local leaders, and won. The Turks fought the Serbs for 70 years until in 1459 the Ottoman Turks conquered Serbia.\nOttoman period.\nOnce the Ottomans conquered Serbia, they got rid of the Serbian upper class. Most Serbs worked as farmers on land owned by Turks. They had to pay high taxes to the Turks. Some Serbs were forced to become Muslims. But the Serbs had their own laws in the Ottoman Empire through the millet system. During the 19th century Serbia gradually became independent. During World War I Austria conquered Serbia but lost the bigger war. Serbia joined other Balkan countries to form Yugoslavia.\nGeography.\nSerbia is found in the Balkan peninsula and the Pannonian Plain. The Danube passes through Serbia. The \u0160ar Mountains of Kosovo form the border with Albania. Over 31% of Serbia is covered by forest. National parks take up 10% of the country's territory. Serbia has 5 national parks and 22 nature reserves.\nEconomy.\nSerbia is classed as an upper-middle income economy.\nThe major processed vegetable crops in Serbia are potatoes, tomatoes and pepper. Serbia is one of the biggest world producers and exporters of raspberries. They are a leading exporter of frozen fruit.\nThere are five international airports in Serbia: Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport, Morava International Airport, Vr\u0161ac International Airport and Pristina International Airport.\n89% of households in Serbia have fixed telephone lines. There are over 9.60\u00A0million cell-phones users. This is larger than the number of the total population of Serbia itself by 30%.\nCulture.\nSerbia has a total of eight sites on the UNESCO World Heritage list: The Early Medieval capital Stari Ras and the 13th-century monastery Sopo\u0107ani, and the 12th-century monastery Studenica, and the endangered Medieval Monuments in Kosovo group, comprising the monasteries of Visoki De\u010Dani, Our Lady of Ljevi\u0161, Gra\u010Danica and Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 (former seat of the Serbian Church, mausoleum of Serbian royalty) and finally the Roman estate of Gamzigrad\u2013Felix Romuliana. There are two literary memorials on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme: The 12th-century Miroslav Gospel, and scientist Nikola Tesla's valuable archive.\nThe most prominent museum in Serbia is the National Museum of Serbia.

Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107 won the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Serbia was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest 2008.\nSports.\nThe most popular sports in Serbia are football, basketball, volleyball, handball, water polo and tennis.\nThe three main football clubs in Serbia are Red Star and Partizan, both from the capital city of Belgrade, and Vojvodina from Novi Sad.\nNovak Djokovic, a multiple Grand Slam-winning tennis player and current number one, is from Serbia.
