The Second War (1332\u20131357) began with the English-supported invasion of Edward Balliol and the 'Disinherited' in 1332, and ended around 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick.\nThe wars were part of a great national crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most important moments in the nation's history. At the end of both wars, Scotland still was a free and independent nation, which was her main aim throughout the conflict. The wars were also important for other reasons, such as the emergence of the longbow as a key weapon in mediaeval warfare.\nBattle of Bannockburn.\nThe Battle of Bannockburn (23\u201324 June 1314) was an important Scottish victory. It was the decisive battle in the First War of Scottish Independence. In this battle, the Scottish king Robert the Bruce defeated the English king Edward II.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"campaign","offset":73},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":98},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":111},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"English","offset":203},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":223},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":285},{"uri":"Northampton","surface_form":"Northampton","offset":295},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":358},{"uri":"Edward_Balliol","surface_form":"Edward Balliol","offset":388},{"uri":"Berwick-upon-Tweed","surface_form":"Berwick","offset":491},{"uri":"Longbow","surface_form":"longbow","offset":840},{"uri":"Mediaeval_warfare","surface_form":"mediaeval warfare","offset":867},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":970},{"uri":"First_War_of_Scottish_Independence","surface_form":"First War of Scottish Independence","offset":1022},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":1087},{"uri":"Robert_I_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Robert the Bruce","offset":1092},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":1122},{"uri":"Edward_II_of_England","surface_form":"Edward II","offset":1135}]}
