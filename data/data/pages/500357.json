{"id":500357,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt","text":"A bolt is a form of grooved fastener with an external helical male thread that engages the interior female thread of a nut. Bolts are closely related to, and often confused with, screws.\nA screw is different from a bolt, because it does not take a nut, and its helical thread is used to penetrate (cut into) a softer material (such as wood).\nThis distinction is not always clear, and sometimes screws are regarded as bolts without a nut.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fastener","surface_form":"fastener","offset":28},{"uri":"Nut_(hardware)","surface_form":"nut","offset":119},{"uri":"Screw","surface_form":"screw","offset":179},{"uri":"Nut_(hardware)","surface_form":"nut","offset":248},{"uri":"Helix","surface_form":"helical","offset":261},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":335}]}
