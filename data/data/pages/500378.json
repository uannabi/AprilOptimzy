{"id":500378,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_thread","text":"A screw thread, often shortened to thread, is a helical structure. It is a ridge wrapped around a cylinder or cone in the form of a helix, with the former being called a \"straight\" thread and the latter called a \"tapered\" thread.\nThe tightening of a nut to a bolt is like driving a wedge into a gap until it sticks through friction and plastic deformation (how the surfaces of the two objects slightly squash together).\nA screw thread is one of the six simple machines which give mechanical advantage.\nThe mechanical advantage of a screw thread depends on its \"lead\", which is the linear distance the screw travels in one turn or revolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Helix","surface_form":"helical","offset":48},{"uri":"Cylinder_(geometry)","surface_form":"cylinder","offset":98},{"uri":"Cone","surface_form":"cone","offset":110},{"uri":"Nut_(hardware)","surface_form":"nut","offset":250},{"uri":"Bolt_(fastener)","surface_form":"bolt","offset":259},{"uri":"Wedge_(mechanics)","surface_form":"wedge","offset":282},{"uri":"Friction","surface_form":"friction","offset":323},{"uri":"Simple_machine","surface_form":"simple machine","offset":453},{"uri":"Mechanical_advantage","surface_form":"mechanical advantage","offset":480},{"uri":"Mechanical_advantage","surface_form":"mechanical advantage","offset":506}]}
