{"id":500452,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_College","text":"Radcliffe College was a women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the female college attached to Harvard University. It was also one of the Seven Sisters colleges.\nIt shared, with Bryn Mawr College, the popular reputation of students being both intellectually and independently minded. Radcliffe gave Radcliffe College diplomas to undergraduates and graduate students for the first 70 or so years of its history.\nIn 1963 Radcliffe gave joint Harvard-Radcliffe diplomas to undergraduates. A formal \"non-merger merger\" agreement with Harvard was signed in 1977. Radcliffe was fully integrated with Harvard by 1999. Today, in Harvard University, Radcliffe's former campus is now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. The former Radcliffe housing at the Radcliffe Quadrangle is now in the Harvard College housing system. Under the terms of the 1999 agreement, the Radcliffe Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle will always keep the \"Radcliffe\" name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":24},{"uri":"Liberal_arts","surface_form":"liberal arts","offset":32},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":45},{"uri":"Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","offset":56},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":113},{"uri":"Seven_Sisters_(colleges)","surface_form":"Seven Sisters colleges","offset":156},{"uri":"Bryn_Mawr_College","surface_form":"Bryn Mawr College","offset":196},{"uri":"Reputation","surface_form":"reputation","offset":227},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":241},{"uri":"Intellectual","surface_form":"intellectual","offset":261},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":280},{"uri":"Diploma","surface_form":"diploma","offset":335},{"uri":"Undergraduate_education","surface_form":"undergraduate","offset":347},{"uri":"Graduate_school","surface_form":"graduate students","offset":366},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":420},{"uri":"Joint","surface_form":"joint","offset":452},{"uri":"Merger","surface_form":"merger","offset":518},{"uri":"Agreement","surface_form":"agreement","offset":533},{"uri":"Integrate","surface_form":"integrate","offset":596},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":639},{"uri":"Campus","surface_form":"campus","offset":678},{"uri":"Radcliffe_Institute_for_Advanced_Study","surface_form":"Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study","offset":696},{"uri":"Housing","surface_form":"housing","offset":757}]}
