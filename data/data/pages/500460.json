They come from the area called Rohan in Brittany. Their line descends from the viscounts of Porho\u00EBt. It is said to trace back to the legendary Conan Meriadoc. Through the Porho\u00EBt, the Rohan are related to the Dukes of Brittany. They also later developed ties with the French and English royal houses. They played an important role in French and European history.\nIn France there were generally considered to have been two individual lines, the Princes of Soubise and the Princes of Gu\u00E9m\u00E9n\u00E9. Both had many other titles. Four Archbishops of Strasbourg were members of the family. The Princes of Rochefort descended from the Gu\u00E9m\u00E9n\u00E9 line.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brittany","surface_form":"Brittany","offset":123}]}
