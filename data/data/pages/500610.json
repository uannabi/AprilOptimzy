{"id":500610,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline","text":"Commonly, a hotline is a telephone service, which offers specialized information. This information can be about how to deal with certain situations, but it can also be about the products of a company. The term originally came from a telephone which would automatically dial a pre-set number, once the receiver is lifted. Such telephones can still be found alongside highways, where they serve to call for help. Today, very often, hotlines are operated by call-centers.\nAlcohol Addiction Hotline.\nWhen a person is addicted to alcohol, it can be difficult for them to quit drinking on their own, or they may find themselves relapsing after various attempts to remain sober. Because of this, an addiction hotline can be useful in connecting individuals with a trusted advisor to answer any questions they may have about substance abuse, most often 24-hours-a-day.\nDrug Abuse Hotline.\nA drug abuse hotline or helpline is a toll-free number that has been established for the specific purpose of providing confidential and anonymous information related to addiction and treatment. Those addicted to alcohol or illegal or prescription drugs can call the telephone number and receive information on substance use, treatment facilities, and other drug-related topics.\nParents or loved ones can call and find out more about addiction, as well as inpatient rehabilitation and other care options. Drug use hotlines are generally available 24 hours a day and are staffed with caring and knowledgeable individuals who want to help.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone","offset":25},{"uri":"Call-Center","surface_form":"call-centers","offset":455}]}
