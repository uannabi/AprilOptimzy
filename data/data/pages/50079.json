{"id":50079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack","text":"=\"preserve\">A dictionary attack is a method used in cryptography to find a key (or username, or password). A large number of words are tried. These words usually come from a special collection, called a \"dictionary\".\nThe attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing. The listing is usually derived from a list of words, such as in a dictionary (hence the phrase \"dictionary attack\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cryptography","surface_form":"cryptography","offset":52},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"key","offset":75},{"uri":"Password","surface_form":"password","offset":96}]}
