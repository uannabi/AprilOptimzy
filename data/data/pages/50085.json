{"id":50085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, two integers (\"a\" and \"b\") are co-prime (or relatively prime) if they share no common factors. This is sometimes written as formula_1. In other words, there is no number, other than 1, that divides both a and b evenly. In which case, the greatest common divisor (GCD, or highest common factor) of these numbers is 1.\n5 = 5*1 (Prime). The only common factor is 1, so they are coprime.\n5 = 5*1 (Prime). The common factors are 5 and 1, so they are not coprime.\nPrime numbers are always coprime to each other.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":33},{"uri":"Greatest_common_divisor","surface_form":"greatest common divisor","offset":267},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"Prime number","offset":487}]}
