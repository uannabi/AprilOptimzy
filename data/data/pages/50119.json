{"id":50119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah","text":"The Kingdom of Judah was an ancient Jewish kingdom that existed in the southern part of the Levant. It was on the western shore of the Dead Sea. Its main cities were Jerusalem and Hebron. It existed from the 9th or 8th century BC, up until 586 BC.\nAfter the death of Saul, Israel picked David to rule them. (1 Chronicles 11:1) After the death of King Solomon, son of David, ten of the twelve of the tribes of Israel did not want Solomon's son, Rehoboam to lead them. This caused the kingdom to split the Northern Kingdom, the Kingdom of Israel and the Southern Kingdom, the Kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.\nIn 586 BC, the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar II, took over Jerusalem and destroyed Judah.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":36},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":43},{"uri":"Levant","surface_form":"Levant","offset":92},{"uri":"Dead_Sea","surface_form":"Dead Sea","offset":135},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":166},{"uri":"Hebron","surface_form":"Hebron","offset":180},{"uri":"Saul","surface_form":"Saul","offset":267},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy)","surface_form":"Israel","offset":273},{"uri":"David","surface_form":"David","offset":287},{"uri":"1_Chronicles","surface_form":"1 Chronicles","offset":308},{"uri":"Solomon","surface_form":"King Solomon","offset":346},{"uri":"Tribes_of_Israel","surface_form":"tribes of Israel","offset":399},{"uri":"Rehoboam","surface_form":"Rehoboam","offset":444},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Israel","surface_form":"Kingdom of Israel","offset":526},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":610},{"uri":"Babylon","surface_form":"Babylon","offset":666},{"uri":"Nebuchadnezzar_II","surface_form":"Nebuchadnezzar II","offset":675}]}
