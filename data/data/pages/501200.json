{"id":501200,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talipot_palm","text":"\"Corypha umbraculifera\", the talipot palm, is a species of palm native to eastern and southern India and Sri Lanka. It is also in Cambodia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand and the Andaman Islands.\nIt is one of the largest palms in the world. Individuals have reached up to 25\u00A0m (82\u00A0ft) with stems up to 1.3\u00A0m (4.25\u00A0ft) in diameter. It is a fan palm (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), with large leaves up to 5\u00A0m (16\u00A0ft) in diameter, with a leaf stem up to 4 m (13 ft), and up to 130 leaflets.\nThe talipot palm bears the largest inflorescence of any plant, 6-8 m (20-26 ft) long, consisting of one to several million small flowers borne on a branched stalk at the top of the trunk. The talipot palm flowers only once, when it is 30 to 80 years old. It takes about a year for the fruit to mature, producing thousands of round, yellow-green fruit 3-4\u00A0cm (1.2-1.6\u00A0in) in diameter, each containing a single seed. The plant dies after fruiting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arecaceae","surface_form":"palm","offset":59},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":95},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":105},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":130},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":140},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":149},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":157},{"uri":"Andaman_Islands","surface_form":"Andaman Islands","offset":174},{"uri":"Arecaceae","surface_form":"Arecaceae","offset":344},{"uri":"Corypheae","surface_form":"Corypheae","offset":360},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"inflorescence","offset":516}]}
