{"id":501223,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_Plan","text":"The Finger Plan () is an urban plan from 1947 which provides a strategy for the development of the Copenhagen metropolitan area in Denmark. According to the plan, all future development of Copenhagen would be along five 'fingers'. These grouped business areas would be near S-train commuter rail lines. The finger-line areas extend from the 'palm' which represents the dense urban area of central Copenhagen. Between the 'fingers', is land for agriculture and recreational use.\nBy the definition used in the Finger Plan, the metropolitan area has a population of 1,930,260 (1 October 2011). It has an area of over 34 municipalities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urban_planning","surface_form":"urban plan","offset":25},{"uri":"Strategy","surface_form":"strategy","offset":63},{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":80},{"uri":"Copenhagen_metropolitan_area","surface_form":"Copenhagen metropolitan area","offset":99},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":131},{"uri":"Plan","surface_form":"plan","offset":157},{"uri":"Urban_planning","surface_form":"future development","offset":167},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":189},{"uri":"Fingers","surface_form":"fingers","offset":221},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":245},{"uri":"S-train","surface_form":"S-train","offset":274},{"uri":"Rail_lines","surface_form":"rail lines","offset":291},{"uri":"Hand","surface_form":"palm","offset":342},{"uri":"Urban_area","surface_form":"urban area","offset":375},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":444},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":460},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":485},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":525},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":549},{"uri":"Municipalities","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":617}]}
