{"id":50141,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent","text":"A talent (or \"gift\", or \"aptitude\") is the skill that someone has to do something very well that people usually like and that is difficult. Someone who has talent is called \"talented\". Talented people may have more than one talent. Talent is sometimes learned, but in some cases is natural born. People often value talents that are entertaining, beautiful, or impressive for a different reason like Music, dancing, acting or sports.\nEven if someone has talent they may still have to work very hard if they want to perform well. Some people become quite good at something even if they do not have much talent, but if they are willing to work very hard at the skill for a period of time.\nThe word \"talent\" used to mean a weight and a piece of money in Assyria, Greece and Rome. This is the sense in which it is used in the Bible in the parable of the five talents (Matthew, xxv, 14-30).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aptitude","surface_form":"aptitude","offset":25},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"Music","offset":399},{"uri":"Dancing","surface_form":"dancing","offset":406},{"uri":"Acting","surface_form":"acting","offset":415},{"uri":"Sports","surface_form":"sports","offset":425},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":719},{"uri":"Coin","surface_form":"piece of money","offset":732},{"uri":"Assyria","surface_form":"Assyria","offset":750},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":759},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":770},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":821},{"uri":"Parables_of_Jesus","surface_form":"parable","offset":834},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Matthew","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":863}]}
