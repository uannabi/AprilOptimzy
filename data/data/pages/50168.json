{"id":50168,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototroph","text":"Phototrophs (\"photo\" = light, \"troph\" = nutrition) or photoautotrophs are organisms which carry out photosynthesis.\nWith their plastids and the help of energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are converted into sugar by photosynthesis. Sugar is then converted into other organic molecules which can be used in cellular functions. Such a function might be, for example, respiration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":74},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":100},{"uri":"Plastid","surface_form":"plastid","offset":127},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":152},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"sunlight","offset":164},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":174},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":193},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":218},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":227},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":278},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":286},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cellular","offset":317},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":326},{"uri":"Respiration","surface_form":"respiration","offset":376}]}
