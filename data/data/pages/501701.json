{"id":501701,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Baltimore_protests","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 2015 Baltimore unrest (also known as the Baltimore uprising) were protests that began on April 25, 2015 in Baltimore, Maryland. The protests happened in response to the death of an African American man named Freddie Gray. Gray was 25 years old. He lived in Baltimore. He had been arrested for having a switchblade. He was in good health when he was arrested. Later, he had injuries to his spine and larynx as a result of being improperly secured in the police fan, ultimately leading to a coma. He died the following week.\nOver 200 people were arrested. A state of emergency was declared in Baltimore. The city was later put under curfew.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":83},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":124},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":198},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":274},{"uri":"Spine","surface_form":"spine","offset":406},{"uri":"Larynx","surface_form":"larynx","offset":416},{"uri":"Coma","surface_form":"coma","offset":506},{"uri":"State_of_emergency","surface_form":"state of emergency","offset":573}]}
