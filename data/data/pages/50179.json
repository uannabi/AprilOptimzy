{"id":50179,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS","text":"=\"preserve\">NTFS is a file system developed by Microsoft. NTFS stands for New Technology File System. A file system is a way of storing computer files. Microsoft introduced it with the Windows NT operating system.\nIt was made to replace the old file-system used by earlier versions of Windows, like Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98SE. That file system was also used by MS-DOS and is called FAT.\nA newer version of NTFS (v3.1) was used in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and the most recent version of operating system, Windows 10. NTFS can be accessed from non-Windows operating systems such as Linux using the NTFS-3G driver.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"File_system","surface_form":"file system","offset":22},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":47},{"uri":"Windows_NT","surface_form":"Windows NT","offset":185},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":196},{"uri":"Windows_95","surface_form":"Windows 95","offset":299},{"uri":"MS-DOS","surface_form":"MS-DOS","offset":375},{"uri":"File_Allocation_Table","surface_form":"FAT","offset":396},{"uri":"Windows_XP","surface_form":"Windows XP","offset":444},{"uri":"Windows_Server_2003","surface_form":"Windows Server 2003","offset":456},{"uri":"Windows_Vista","surface_form":"Windows Vista","offset":477},{"uri":"Windows_10","surface_form":"Windows 10","offset":541},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":617},{"uri":"NTFS-3G","surface_form":"NTFS-3G","offset":633}]}
