{"id":501794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_drill","text":"A seed drill is a sowing device that sows the seed precisely in the soil at proper depth and distance. Then it covers them with soil. It protects the seeds from birds and saves time and labour.\nJethro Tull is widely thought of as having invented the seed drill, though earlier the Sumerians used a single-tube seed drill, and the Chinese had also used a multi-tube seed drill. The use of a seed drill can improve the ratio of crop yield (seeds harvested per seed planted) by as much as nine times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jethro_Tull_(agriculturist)","surface_form":"Jethro Tull","offset":194}]}
