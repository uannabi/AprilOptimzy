{"id":501884,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_genomics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Synthetic genomics is a type of genetic engineering. It makes genes which never occur in nature.\nSynthetic genomics does not use naturally occurring genes. It may use custom-designed base pair series. In the future, it might use genetic codes that are not composed of the two base pairs of DNA currently used by life forms.\nSynthetic genomics uses techniques from genetics research. Researchers can make long base pair chains cheaply and accurately on a large scale. This allows them to do experiments on genomes which do not exist in nature. They also use ideas in protein folding and high-end computing facilities.\nGeneticists have made the first synthetic chromosome for yeast. \"The genes in the original chromosome were replaced with synthetic versions and the finished man-made chromosome was then successfully integrated into a yeast cell\".\nOther companies, including one called Synthetic Genomics (company), have been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genetic_engineering","surface_form":"genetic engineering","offset":45},{"uri":"Genes","surface_form":"genes","offset":75},{"uri":"Base_pair","surface_form":"base pair","offset":196},{"uri":"Genetic_code","surface_form":"genetic code","offset":242},{"uri":"Base_pair","surface_form":"two base pairs","offset":285},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":303},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":377},{"uri":"Base_pair","surface_form":"base pair","offset":422},{"uri":"Genomes","surface_form":"genomes","offset":518},{"uri":"Protein_folding","surface_form":"protein folding","offset":579},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":672},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":687},{"uri":"Synthetic_Genomics_(company)","surface_form":"Synthetic Genomics (company)","offset":898}]}
