{"id":50204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukko","text":"Ukko was the most important god in Finnish paganism, a religion that was in Finland before Christianity. Ukko was god of sky and thunder. Ukko was an old man and he lived on the sky. He had a weapon - hammer or axe called \"Ukonvasara\". Lightning is from this weapon.\nFinnish pagans had an image of this weapon made from metal on their necks. They believed that lightning does not hit people who have this image.\nAt Midsummer Finns gathered together and drank beer to honour Ukko. That was called \"toast of Ukko\".\nUkko is similar to Thor that was a sky god of most Scandinavians and Perun that is a Baltic sky god.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":28},{"uri":"Finnish_paganism","surface_form":"Finnish paganism","offset":35},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":76},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":91},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":121},{"uri":"Thunder","surface_form":"thunder","offset":129},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":192},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":201},{"uri":"Axe","surface_form":"axe","offset":211},{"uri":"Lightning","surface_form":"Lightning","offset":236},{"uri":"Midsummer","surface_form":"Midsummer","offset":415},{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"beer","offset":459},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":532},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":564},{"uri":"Perun","surface_form":"Perun","offset":582},{"uri":"Baltic_region","surface_form":"Baltic","offset":598}]}
