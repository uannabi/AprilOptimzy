Apps are usually available through an app store for that platform. These began appearing in 2008. The largest stores are operated by the owner of the mobile operating system.\nSome apps are usually bundled with the device, already installed before you buy it. Other apps may be downloaded for free from the app store, and some must be purchased. Software developers make as they make other computer programs, and usually offer them through the app store.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":78},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":114},{"uri":"Tablet_computer","surface_form":"tablet computer","offset":127},{"uri":"Mobile_device","surface_form":"mobile device","offset":154},{"uri":"App_store","surface_form":"app store","offset":208},{"uri":"Computing_platform","surface_form":"platform","offset":227},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"mobile operating system","offset":320},{"uri":"Purchase","surface_form":"purchase","offset":504},{"uri":"Software_developer","surface_form":"Software developer","offset":515},{"uri":"App_store","surface_form":"app store","offset":613}]}
