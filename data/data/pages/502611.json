{"id":502611,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelt","text":"Spelt (\"Triticum spelta\"), sometimes called dinkel wheat or hulled wheat'\", is a type of wheat. It has been cultivated since 5000 BC. It is a hexaploid wheat, which means it has six sets of chromosomes.\nSpelt was an important staple food in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times. It is still grown in Central Europe and northern Spain. Spelt originated before common wheat (\"Triticum aestivum\"), and that bread wheat is derived from spelt.\nSpelt has become more popular as a type of bread in recent years. Spelt costs more than modern wheats. One reason is that it is a minority product. It also needs an extra stage to remove its husks before milling (grinding).\nSpelt needs less pesticide than normal wheat. Nutritionally, wholemeal spelt is similar to normal wholemeal wheat, with higher protein content.\nPeople with celiac disease should avoid eating spelt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":89},{"uri":"Domestication","surface_form":"cultivated","offset":108},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":130},{"uri":"Polyploidy","surface_form":"hexaploid","offset":142},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":190},{"uri":"Staple_food","surface_form":"staple food","offset":226},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":250},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":266},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"medieval times","offset":280},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":317},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":345},{"uri":"Common_wheat","surface_form":"common wheat","offset":376},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":499},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticide","offset":697},{"uri":"Nutrition","surface_form":"Nutrition","offset":726},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":807},{"uri":"Celiac_disease","surface_form":"celiac disease","offset":836}]}
