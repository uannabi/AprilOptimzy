{"id":502659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickling","text":"Pickling is a method of making food last longer. In pickling, the food is put either into vinegar, or in salt water (called brine). This food is often put in an airtight jar. Pickling also changes the flavour of the food.\nThe key to pickling is that it produces low pH, 4.6 or lower. This kills most bacteria. Pickling can preserve perishable foods for months. Anti-microbial herbs and spices, such as mustard seed, garlic, cinnamon or cloves, are often added.\nCommon pickled foods include eggs, onions and other vegetables.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":31},{"uri":"Vinegar","surface_form":"vinegar","offset":90},{"uri":"Brine","surface_form":"brine","offset":124},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":266},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":300},{"uri":"Decomposition","surface_form":"perishable","offset":332},{"uri":"Microbe","surface_form":"microbial","offset":366},{"uri":"Herbs","surface_form":"herbs","offset":376},{"uri":"Spices","surface_form":"spices","offset":386},{"uri":"Mustard","surface_form":"mustard","offset":402},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":416},{"uri":"Cinnamon","surface_form":"cinnamon","offset":424},{"uri":"Clove","surface_form":"clove","offset":436},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":490},{"uri":"Onions","surface_form":"onions","offset":496},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetables","offset":513}]}
