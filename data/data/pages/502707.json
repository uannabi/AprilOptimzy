{"id":502707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-out","text":"Take-out or takeout (also called \"carry-out\", \"take away\" or \"parcel\") is food prepared in a restaurant that is eaten somewhere else. A concept found in many ancient cultures, take-out food is now common worldwide. There are any number of different cuisines and dishes to choose from.\nThe concept of prepared meals to be eaten elsewhere dates back to antiquity. Market and roadside stalls selling food were common in both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. In Pompeii, archaeologists have found a number of \"thermopolia\". These were service counters opening onto the street, which provided food to be taken away and eaten elsewhere. There is a distinct lack of formal dining and kitchen area in Pompeian homes. This suggests that eating, or at least cooking, at home was unusual. Over 200 \"thermopolia\" have been found in the ruins of Pompeii.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":74},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":93},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":158},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":166},{"uri":"Worldwide","surface_form":"worldwide","offset":204},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":249},{"uri":"Antiquity","surface_form":"antiquity","offset":351},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"Market","offset":362},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":422},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Rome","offset":441},{"uri":"Pompeii","surface_form":"Pompeii","offset":458},{"uri":"Archaeologist","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":467},{"uri":"Thermopolium","surface_form":"thermopolia","offset":506}]}
