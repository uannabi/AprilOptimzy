It comes from Polynesia and other lands in the Pacific Islands.\nThe roots of the plant are used to make a drink with sedative and anesthetic properties. Kava is used in many cultures in the Pacific Ocean, besides its native Polynesia. These include Hawaii, Vanuatu, Melanesia and some parts of Micronesia.\nKava is pain-relieving, calming. and is usually taken as a drug to relax without losing mental clarity in thinking and remembering. Evidence collected in studies show it is likely to be more effective than a placebo at helping calm some mild anxiety.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polynesia","surface_form":"Polynesia","offset":52},{"uri":"Pacific_Islands","surface_form":"Pacific Islands","offset":85},{"uri":"Sedative","surface_form":"sedative","offset":155},{"uri":"Anesthetic","surface_form":"anesthetic","offset":168},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":212},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":228},{"uri":"Polynesia","surface_form":"Polynesia","offset":262},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":287},{"uri":"Vanuatu","surface_form":"Vanuatu","offset":295},{"uri":"Melanesia","surface_form":"Melanesia","offset":304},{"uri":"Micronesia","surface_form":"Micronesia","offset":332},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":403},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"Evidence","offset":476},{"uri":"Placebo","surface_form":"placebo","offset":552},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":586}]}
