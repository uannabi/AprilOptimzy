{"id":50298,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate","text":"A phosphate is a salt of phosphoric acid. Phosphates are important in biochemistry.\nPhosphates have the formula PO43- and a molar mass of 94.973 g/mol. An example of a phosphate is sodium phosphate. Three different types of phosphates are known. They are orthophosphate, PO43-; metaphosphate, PO32-; and pyrophosphate, P2O73-. They have a combining power of 3.\nStructure.\nPhosphates are made of one phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms.\nMany phosphates do not dissolve in water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":17},{"uri":"Phosphoric_acid","surface_form":"phosphoric acid","offset":25},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":70},{"uri":"Sodium_phosphate","surface_form":"sodium phosphate","offset":181},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":410},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":434},{"uri":"Atoms","surface_form":"atoms","offset":441},{"uri":"Solvation","surface_form":"dissolve","offset":471}]}
