{"id":50310,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Karelia is an area in eastern Fennoscandia. It is to the east from where Finnish people live. There are many opinions about what places exactly belong to Karelia.\nMost of Karelia belongs to Russia today. Small parts of Karelia belong to Finland. On the Russian side of Karelia is the Republic of Karelia. On the Finnish side are the provinces of North Karelia and South Karelia.\nThe original people of Karelia are Karelians. Karelian people speak Karelian, a Finnic language very close to Finnish. Karelians knew many old poems. Many poems of the Finnish book Kalevala are from the Karelians. Today in the Republic of Karelia, Karelians are a minority and Russians are a majority. Some people fear Karelian culture and language will die out.\nMost of Karelia was part of Finland until the Soviet Union took it in the Winter War. East Karelia was not. To make peace after World War II, Finland had to give most of Karelia to the Soviet Union. After peace, many people from the Soviet Union went to live in Karelia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fennoscandia","surface_form":"Fennoscandia","offset":43},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":86},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":203},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":250},{"uri":"Republic_of_Karelia","surface_form":"Republic of Karelia","offset":297},{"uri":"North_Karelia","surface_form":"North Karelia","offset":359},{"uri":"South_Karelia","surface_form":"South Karelia","offset":377},{"uri":"Karelians","surface_form":"Karelians","offset":427},{"uri":"Finnic_language","surface_form":"Finnic language","offset":472},{"uri":"Finnish_language","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":502},{"uri":"Poems","surface_form":"poems","offset":535},{"uri":"Kalevala","surface_form":"Kalevala","offset":573},{"uri":"Minority","surface_form":"minority","offset":656},{"uri":"Majority","surface_form":"majority","offset":684},{"uri":"Winter_War","surface_form":"Winter War","offset":829},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":883},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":940}]}
