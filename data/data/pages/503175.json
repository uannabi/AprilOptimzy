{"id":503175,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octocorallia","text":"Octocorallia is a subclass of the Anthozoa in the phylum Cnidaria. There are over 3.000 different species.\nThese animals have an eight-fold symmetry. Most are colonial sessile polyps. Octocorallia look like the stony corals. Stony corals have a six-fold symmetry, and are classified in the group Hexacorallia. Unlike the stony corals, most Octocoralllia lack a lasting skeleton. For this reason, they do not build coral reefs. An older name for this group is Alcyonaria.\nMany species form symbioses with unicellular algae. Octocorallia have many enemies: For this reason, many are toxic, or they taste bad. Many species of the Octocorallia can reproduce both sexually and asexually: It is common to find a colony of Octocorallia, where most polyps have the same sex.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anthozoa","surface_form":"Anthozoa","offset":34},{"uri":"Cnidaria","surface_form":"Cnidaria","offset":57},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":98},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetry","offset":140},{"uri":"Colony_(biology)","surface_form":"colonial","offset":159},{"uri":"Sessile","surface_form":"sessile","offset":168},{"uri":"Polyp","surface_form":"polyp","offset":176},{"uri":"Stony_coral","surface_form":"stony coral","offset":211},{"uri":"Hexacorallia","surface_form":"Hexacorallia","offset":296},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":369},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":414},{"uri":"Symbiosis","surface_form":"symbioses","offset":489},{"uri":"Unicellular","surface_form":"unicellular","offset":504},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":516},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":581},{"uri":"Sexual_reproduction","surface_form":"sexually","offset":659},{"uri":"Asexual_reproduction","surface_form":"asexually","offset":672}]}
