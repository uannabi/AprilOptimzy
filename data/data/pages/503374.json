If someone thinks about The Game, they lose. If someone loses, they must tell someone or announce that they \"lost The Game.\"\nThe first known reference of The Game appeared in 1990, though no one is sure how it started, and unofficially ended on December 30, 2020. It lasted about 30 years and accumulated millions of \u201Cplayers\u201D around the world.\nA similar game was played by Leo Tolstoy in 1840. The media has reported on The Game in many countries and has guessed the number of players to be in the millions.\nA similar game, \u201CThe Game\u201D (pronounced \u201C\u2018thee\u2019 game\u201D not \u201C\u2018tha\u2019 game\u201D is played by thinking about said game, then you win.
