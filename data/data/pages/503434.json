{"id":503434,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_fork","text":"A garden fork, also called a spading fork or digging fork, is a tool for digging. It is used for loosening soil in gardening and farming. It is used similarly to a spade, but it can be pushed more easily into the ground. It does not cut through plant roots. Garden forks were made of wood, but now most are made of steel.\nGarden forks are slightly different from pitchforks. Their tines are usually shorter and thicker and closer together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":107},{"uri":"Spade","surface_form":"spade","offset":164},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":315},{"uri":"Pitchfork","surface_form":"pitchfork","offset":363},{"uri":"Tine","surface_form":"tines","offset":381}]}
