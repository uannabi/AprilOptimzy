An embedded system or a computer connects each thing together in a network and to the internet. Some technologies used for the internet of things are RFID and meshnets.\nThe connections allow each thing to collect and exchange data, and we can control them remotely or by setting rules or chains of actions. IoT improves the ease of life of humans and their daily activities. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":38},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":48},{"uri":"Computer_network","surface_form":"computer network","offset":120},{"uri":"Embedded_system","surface_form":"embedded system","offset":168},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":189},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technologies","offset":266}]}
