{"id":50345,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycota","text":"Chytridiomycota is a phylum of the Fungi kingdom. The name comes from chytridium (from the Greek \"chytridion\", meaning \"little pot\"): the structure containing unreleased spores.\nThe chytrids are the most primitive of the fungi. Many chytrids are found in fresh water. There are approximately 1,000 chytrid species, in 127 genera, distributed among 5 orders.\nChytrids get their energy mostly from non-living organic matter.\nBoth zoospores and gametes of the chytrids are mobile by their flagella, one whiplash per individual.\nSome chytrid species are known to kill amphibians in large numbers. The actual process, however, is unknown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":21},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"Fungi","offset":35},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":41},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":91},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":170},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":255},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":377},{"uri":"Organic_matter","surface_form":"organic matter","offset":407},{"uri":"Zoospore","surface_form":"zoospore","offset":428},{"uri":"Gamete","surface_form":"gamete","offset":442},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":564}]}
