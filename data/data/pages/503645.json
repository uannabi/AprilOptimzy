Its full name was the First All-Union Philatelic, Scripophilic and Numismatic Exhibition. This was because it combined the objects of philately, scripophily (collecting stock and bond certificates), and numismatics (of coins, money).\nThe exhibition was organised from 15 December 1924 to 15 February 1925. This was done by the Presidium of the All-Union Philatelic Association and Board of the All-Russian Society of Philatelists. The combined exhibition was meant to prepare formation of the \"All-Union Society of Collectors\". The society was to be under the direction of Feodor Chuchin, the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":54},{"uri":"Philately","surface_form":"philately","offset":209},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"stock","offset":244},{"uri":"Numismatics","surface_form":"numismatics","offset":278},{"uri":"Exhibition","surface_form":"exhibition","offset":313},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organised","offset":328},{"uri":"Board_of_directors","surface_form":"Board","offset":456},{"uri":"All-Russian_Society_of_Philatelists","surface_form":"All-Russian Society of Philatelists","offset":469},{"uri":"Exhibition","surface_form":"exhibition","offset":519},{"uri":"All-Union_Society_of_Collectors","surface_form":"All-Union Society of Collectors","offset":569},{"uri":"Organisation_of_the_Commissioner_for_Philately_and_Scripophily","surface_form":"Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily","offset":668}]}
