{"id":503802,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stotting","text":"Stotting (or pronking) is a behaviour of some bovines, particularly gazelles. They spring into the air, and lift all four feet off the ground simultaneously. Usually, the legs are held in a relatively stiff position and the back may be arched with the head pointing downward. Many explanations of stotting have been proposed. At least in some cases it is an honest signal to predators that the stotting animal is not worth pursuing.\nSome possible explanations.\nThe English evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith concludes that \"the natural explanation is that stotting is an index of condition and of escape capability\", used as a signal especially to coursing predators. He also observes that \"it is hard to see how it could be a handicap\", unless perhaps it is a signal to other gazelles of the same species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bovines","surface_form":"bovines","offset":46},{"uri":"Gazelle","surface_form":"gazelle","offset":68},{"uri":"Predators","surface_form":"predators","offset":375},{"uri":"John_Maynard_Smith","surface_form":"John Maynard Smith","offset":496}]}
