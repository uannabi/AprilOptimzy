{"id":503890,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiprism","text":"In geometry an antiprism is a polyhedron. It is made of two copies of a regular polygon. These polygons are connected using an alternating band of triangles. To connect an n-sided polygon, 2n triangles are needed. Antiprisms are similar to prisms, but prisms use parallelograms for the bands at the side.\nA right antiprism uses a right angle to connect the base polygons to the band of triangles. A uniform antiprism uses equilateral triangles as base surfaces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Polyhedron","surface_form":"polyhedron","offset":30},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":80},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":147},{"uri":"Prism_(geometry)","surface_form":"prisms","offset":240},{"uri":"Parallelogram","surface_form":"parallelogram","offset":263},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angle","offset":330},{"uri":"Equilateral_triangle","surface_form":"equilateral triangles","offset":422}]}
