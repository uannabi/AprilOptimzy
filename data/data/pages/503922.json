A \"Slate Magazine\" writer said that the trailer made the movie look too much like the first one. James Hibberd of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that the trailer \"retains and amplifies several elements from the original\". He also gave praise that \"the modernizing doesn\u2019t result in, say, the family\u2019s daughter being kidnapped by ghosts in Snapchat\". Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting said that \"while every fiber of my being wants to reject it, [the film] actually looks pretty insane\", and praised the trailer's last scene. A \"Polygon\" writer said that the trailer looked similar to the first movie, but that it \"looks great, as a horror movie\".\nReception.\n\"Poltergeist\" has not received good reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the movie got only a 34%, with 77 reviews. The audience rating was 34% who say they liked it. On Metacritic, the movie has a score of 47 out of 100, given by 25 critics.
