When a regular icosahedron is truncated, this means that each \"corner\" (or vertex) is replaced by a pentagon, as there are five edges at each corner.\nA truncated icosahedron is made of 12 regular pentagons and 20 hexagons. It has 60 vertices, and 90 edges.\nTruncated icosahedra in nature.\nThe molecule Fullerene is made of 60 carbon atoms and looks like a truncated icosahedron.\nMost soccer balls are truncated icosahedra.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Archimedean_solid","surface_form":"Archimedean solid","offset":30},{"uri":"Icosahedron","surface_form":"icosahedron","offset":107},{"uri":"Pentagon","surface_form":"pentagon","offset":192},{"uri":"Pentagon","surface_form":"pentagon","offset":288},{"uri":"Hexagon","surface_form":"hexagon","offset":305},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":385},{"uri":"Fullerene","surface_form":"Fullerene","offset":394},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":418},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atoms","offset":425}]}
