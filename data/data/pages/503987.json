{"id":503987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal","text":"e=\"preserve\">An academic or scholarly journal contains articles written by experts in a particular subject. Academic journals are often forums for discussing new research, and the critique of existing research. They usually contain articles presenting original research, review articles, and book reviews. The purpose of an academic journal is to give researchers a place to exchange knowledge. Academic journals can be traced back to the 17th century.\nThe term \"academic journal\" applies to scholarly publications in all fields. Scientific journals and journals of the social sciences vary in form and function from journals of the humanities. A particular type of academic journal is the peer reviewed journal. Articles are sent out anonymously to other experts in the same field. In this way they won't know the author's name and can remain impartial. Experts review the article before it is published.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Article","surface_form":"article","offset":55},{"uri":"Expert","surface_form":"expert","offset":75},{"uri":"Subject","surface_form":"subject","offset":99},{"uri":"Forum","surface_form":"forum","offset":136},{"uri":"Discussion","surface_form":"discussing","offset":147},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":162},{"uri":"Critique","surface_form":"critique","offset":180},{"uri":"Original_research","surface_form":"original research","offset":252},{"uri":"Review_article","surface_form":"review article","offset":271},{"uri":"Book_review","surface_form":"book review","offset":292},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":439},{"uri":"Scientific_journal","surface_form":"Scientific journal","offset":530},{"uri":"Social_sciences","surface_form":"social sciences","offset":570},{"uri":"Humanities","surface_form":"humanities","offset":633},{"uri":"Peer_review","surface_form":"peer review","offset":690},{"uri":"Anonymously","surface_form":"anonymously","offset":735},{"uri":"Impartial","surface_form":"impartial","offset":844},{"uri":"Review","surface_form":"review","offset":863},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"published","offset":895}]}
