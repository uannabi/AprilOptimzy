{"id":504208,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column","text":"Trajan's Column is a Roman triumphal column in Rome, Italy. It was built to remember Roman emperor Trajan's victory in the Dacian Wars. It was probably built by the architect Apollodorus of Damascus at the order of the Roman Senate. It is in Trajan's Forum, near the Quirinal Hill, north of the Roman Forum. It was completed in AD 113. It has a spiral bas relief, which shows the wars between the Romans and Dacians (101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106). Its design has inspired numerous victory columns, both ancient and modern.\nThe column is about 30 metres (98\u00A0ft) in height, 35 metres (125\u00A0ft) including its large pedestal. It is made from a series of 20 hollow Carrara marble pieces. Each one weighs about 32 tons, with a diameter of 3.7 metres (11\u00A0ft). The 190-metre (625\u00A0ft) frieze winds around the column 23 times. Inside the column, a spiral staircase of 185 steps gives access to a viewing platform at the top. The capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of c. 34\u00A0m.\nAncient coins show plans to put a statue of an eagle on top of the column. However it was built with a statue of Trajan. This statue disappeared in the Middle Ages. On December 4, 1587, the top was crowned by Pope Sixtus V with a bronze figure of St. Peter. When it was built the column was next to two libraries, which perhaps held the soldier-emperor's account of the Roman-Dacian Wars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_triumphal_column","surface_form":"Roman triumphal column","offset":21},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":47},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":53},{"uri":"Roman_emperor","surface_form":"Roman emperor","offset":85},{"uri":"Trajan","surface_form":"Trajan","offset":99},{"uri":"Trajan%27s_Dacian_Wars","surface_form":"Dacian Wars","offset":123},{"uri":"Apollodorus_of_Damascus","surface_form":"Apollodorus of Damascus","offset":175},{"uri":"Roman_Senate","surface_form":"Roman Senate","offset":219},{"uri":"Trajan%27s_Forum","surface_form":"Trajan's Forum","offset":242},{"uri":"Quirinal_Hill","surface_form":"Quirinal Hill","offset":267},{"uri":"Roman_Forum","surface_form":"Roman Forum","offset":295},{"uri":"Anno_Domini","surface_form":"AD","offset":328},{"uri":"Bas_relief","surface_form":"bas relief","offset":352},{"uri":"Dacia","surface_form":"Dacia","offset":408},{"uri":"Victory_column","surface_form":"victory column","offset":472},{"uri":"Pedestal","surface_form":"pedestal","offset":602},{"uri":"Carrara_marble","surface_form":"Carrara marble","offset":650},{"uri":"Frieze","surface_form":"frieze","offset":766},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":1159},{"uri":"Pope_Sixtus_V","surface_form":"Pope Sixtus V","offset":1216},{"uri":"St._Peter","surface_form":"St. Peter","offset":1254},{"uri":"Libraries","surface_form":"libraries","offset":1310}]}
