{"id":504277,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Community_Grid","text":"e=\"preserve\">World Community Grid (WCG) is a large public computing grid to work on scientific research projects that help people. People donate time on their personal computers to the project. The software can be set up to run only when the computer is not being used for other work.\nWCG began operation on November 16, 2004. It is coordinated by IBM to use their Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software. Software for the grid of personal computers is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS\u00A0X, and Android operating systems.\nWorld Community Grid's research projects have performed analysis of aspects of the human genome, HIV, dengue, muscular dystrophy, cancer, influenza, rice crop yields and renewable energy.\nOpen projects running as of May 2015 are looking for drug treatments for the Ebola virus and HIV, seeking new materials for the next generation of solar cells, comparing genomes of many organisms, and investigating cancer genes. As of May 2015, the organization has partnered with 467 other companies and organizations to help its work, and has over 65,000 active registered users.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grid_computing","surface_form":"computing grid","offset":58},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific research","offset":84},{"uri":"Project","surface_form":"project","offset":104},{"uri":"Donate","surface_form":"donate","offset":138},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"personal computer","offset":159},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":198},{"uri":"Coordinate","surface_form":"coordinated","offset":333},{"uri":"IBM","surface_form":"IBM","offset":348},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":424},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":495},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":504},{"uri":"OS_X","surface_form":"Mac OS\u00A0X","offset":511},{"uri":"Android_(operating_system)","surface_form":"Android","offset":525},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":533},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":608},{"uri":"Aspect","surface_form":"aspects","offset":620},{"uri":"Human_genome","surface_form":"human genome","offset":635},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":649},{"uri":"Dengue","surface_form":"dengue","offset":654},{"uri":"Muscular_dystrophy","surface_form":"muscular dystrophy","offset":662},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":682},{"uri":"Influenza","surface_form":"influenza","offset":690},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice crop yields","offset":701},{"uri":"Renewable_energy","surface_form":"renewable energy","offset":722},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":793},{"uri":"Therapy","surface_form":"treatments","offset":798},{"uri":"Ebola_virus","surface_form":"Ebola virus","offset":817},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":833},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":850},{"uri":"Photovoltaics","surface_form":"solar cells","offset":887},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":910},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":926},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":962},{"uri":"Partnership","surface_form":"partnered","offset":1006},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"companies","offset":1031},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":1045},{"uri":"Registered_user","surface_form":"registered user","offset":1104}]}
