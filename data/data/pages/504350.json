{"id":504350,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_architecture","text":"Ottoman architecture is the architecture of the Ottoman Empire. It emerged in Bursa and Edirne in 14th and 15th centuries. The architecture of the empire developed from the earlier Seljuk architecture. It was influenced by the Byzantine, Iranian and Seljuk architecture. It was also influenced by Islamic Mamluk traditions after the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. For almost 400 years Byzantine architectural artifacts such as the church of Hagia Sophia served as models for many of the Ottoman mosques. Overall, Ottoman architecture has been described as Ottoman architecture synthesized with architectural traditions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.\nThe Ottomans achieved the highest level architecture in their lands. They mastered the technique of building vast inner spaces confined by seemingly weightless yet massive domes. Their work achieved harmony between inner and outer spaces, as well as light and shadow. Islamic religious building, which until then was simple but with extensive decoration, was transformed by the Ottomans. They used vaults, domes, semi-domes and columns. The mosque was changed from being a cramped and dark chamber with arabesque-covered walls into a beautiful sanctuary.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":28},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":48},{"uri":"Emerge","surface_form":"emerge","offset":67},{"uri":"Bursa","surface_form":"Bursa","offset":78},{"uri":"Edirne","surface_form":"Edirne","offset":88},{"uri":"Seljuk_architecture","surface_form":"Seljuk architecture","offset":181},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":209},{"uri":"Byzantine_architecture","surface_form":"Byzantine","offset":227},{"uri":"Iranian","surface_form":"Iranian","offset":238},{"uri":"Seljuk_architecture","surface_form":"Seljuk architecture","offset":250},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":297},{"uri":"Mamluk","surface_form":"Mamluk","offset":305},{"uri":"Fall_of_Constantinople","surface_form":"conquest of Constantinople","offset":333},{"uri":"Hagia_Sophia","surface_form":"Hagia Sophia","offset":454},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":508},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman","offset":678},{"uri":"Master","surface_form":"master","offset":748},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmony","offset":873},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":950},{"uri":"Vault_(architecture)","surface_form":"vaults","offset":1072},{"uri":"Dome","surface_form":"dome","offset":1080},{"uri":"Column","surface_form":"column","offset":1102},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":1115},{"uri":"Chamber","surface_form":"chamber","offset":1164},{"uri":"Arabesque","surface_form":"arabesque","offset":1177},{"uri":"Sanctuary","surface_form":"sanctuary","offset":1218}]}
