{"id":504476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbel","text":"In architecture a corbel or console is a structural piece of stone, wood or metal sticking out from a wall to carry a superincumbent weight. It is a type of bracket. A corbel is a solid piece of material in the wall. A console, by comparison, is a piece applied to the structure. A piece of structural wood projecting in the same way was called a \"tassel\" or a \"bragger\" in the UK. The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic, or New Stone Age, times.\nThe word \"corbel\" comes from Old French and derives from the Latin \"corbellus\", a diminutive of \"corvus\" (a raven) which refers to the beak-like appearance. Similarly, the French refer to a bracket-corbel, usually a load-bearing internal feature, as a \"corbeau\" (a crow).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":3},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structural","offset":41},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":61},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":68},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":76},{"uri":"Superincumbent","surface_form":"superincumbent","offset":118},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":195},{"uri":"Parapet","surface_form":"parapet","offset":462},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":491},{"uri":"Old_French","surface_form":"Old French","offset":556},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":588},{"uri":"Diminutive","surface_form":"diminutive","offset":609},{"uri":"Raven","surface_form":"raven","offset":635},{"uri":"Crow","surface_form":"crow","offset":792}]}
