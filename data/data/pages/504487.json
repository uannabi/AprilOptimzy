{"id":504487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_linsang","text":"DNA analysis on 29 species showed that \"Prionodon\" was the sister-group of the family Felidae. So the Asiatic linsangs are put in a family of their own, the Prionodontidae. \"Prionodon\" is not closely related to the African linsangs, although they look similar, and live a similar life. They are small cat-like carnivores adapted to catching small prey among the trees of a tropical forest. The similarities between the two groups came about by convergent evolution.\n\"Prionodon\" is basal to the Feliformia and a sister taxon of the Felidae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"DNA_analysis","surface_form":"DNA analysis","offset":0},{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"Felidae","offset":86},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":132},{"uri":"African_linsang","surface_form":"African linsang","offset":215},{"uri":"Convergent_evolution","surface_form":"convergent evolution","offset":444},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":481},{"uri":"Feliformia","surface_form":"Feliformia","offset":494},{"uri":"Sister_taxon","surface_form":"sister taxon","offset":511},{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"Felidae","offset":531}]}
