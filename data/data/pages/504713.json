{"id":504713,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Bronco","text":"The Ford Bronco was a utility vehicle that was produced from 1966 to 1996. It had five distinct generations. All these vehicles are currently classified as sport utility vehicles (SUV). The Broncos can be divided into two categories: early Broncos (1966\u201377) and full-size Broncos (1978\u201396).\nThe Bronco was introduced in 1966. It was a competitor to the small four-wheel drive compact SUVs that included the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout. It was built on its own platform. Ford positioned the Bronco between the Jeep and Scout. But it was too small to capture the US market. A major redesign in 1978 moved the Bronco to a larger size. It used a shortened Ford F-Series truck chassis to compete with both the similarly adapted Chevrolet K5 Blazer, as well as the Dodge Ramcharger.\nThe full-size Broncos and the successor Expedition were produced at Ford's Michigan Truck Plant in Wayne, Michigan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":96},{"uri":"Sport_utility_vehicle","surface_form":"sport utility vehicle","offset":156},{"uri":"Categories","surface_form":"categories","offset":222},{"uri":"Full-size_vehicle","surface_form":"full-size","offset":262},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competitor","offset":335},{"uri":"Four-wheel_drive","surface_form":"four-wheel drive","offset":359},{"uri":"Compact_car","surface_form":"compact","offset":376},{"uri":"CJ-5","surface_form":"Jeep CJ-5","offset":407},{"uri":"International_Harvester_Scout","surface_form":"International Harvester Scout","offset":421},{"uri":"Automobile_platform","surface_form":"platform","offset":476},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":577},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":580},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":598},{"uri":"Ford_F-Series","surface_form":"Ford F-Series","offset":668},{"uri":"Chassis","surface_form":"chassis","offset":688},{"uri":"Chevrolet_K5_Blazer","surface_form":"Chevrolet K5 Blazer","offset":739},{"uri":"Dodge_Ramcharger","surface_form":"Dodge Ramcharger","offset":775},{"uri":"Ford_Expedition","surface_form":"Expedition","offset":833},{"uri":"Michigan_Assembly_Plant","surface_form":"Michigan Truck","offset":868},{"uri":"Wayne%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Wayne, Michigan","offset":892}]}
