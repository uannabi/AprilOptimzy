{"id":504912,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_C/K_Trucks","text":"The C/K was Chevrolet and GMC's full-size pickup truck. The series was produced from 1960 until 1999 in the United States. In Canada it was produced from 1965 to 1999. South American trucks were made from 1964 through 2001 in Brazil and from 1975 to 1982 in Chile.\nThe first Chevrolet pickup truck appeared in 1918. The buyer provided the all-wood cab or got it after an aftermarket supplier added it to the chassis. The same was true for the steel cargo bed.. \"C\" indicated two-wheel drive and \"K\" indicated four-wheel drive. The aging C/K light-duty pickup truck was replaced with the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra names in 1999 in the US and Canada. In 2001 in Brazil they were called the Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD heavy-duty pickup trucks. Until this time the names Silverado and Sierra were used to identify the trim level of the C/K trucks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":12},{"uri":"General_Motors","surface_form":"GMC","offset":26},{"uri":"Full-size_pickup","surface_form":"full-size pickup truck","offset":32},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":60},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"produced","offset":71},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":108},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":126},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":168},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":226},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":258},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":343},{"uri":"Cabin_(truck)","surface_form":"cab","offset":348},{"uri":"Aftermarket_(automotive)","surface_form":"aftermarket supplier","offset":371},{"uri":"Chassis","surface_form":"chassis","offset":408},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":443},{"uri":"Pickup_truck","surface_form":"cargo bed","offset":449},{"uri":"Two-wheel_drive","surface_form":"two-wheel drive","offset":475},{"uri":"Four-wheel_drive","surface_form":"four-wheel drive","offset":509},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Silverado","surface_form":"Chevrolet Silverado","offset":587}]}
