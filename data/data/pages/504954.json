{"id":504954,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_(movie)","text":"\"Cyborg\" is a 1989 martial arts and science fiction movie. The movie is about post-apocalyptic times.\nProduction.\nCannon Films had planned to make a sequel to the 1987 He-Man movie \"Masters of the Universe\" and a live action version of 'Spider Man'. Both projects were planned to shoot at the same time by Albert Pyun. Cannon, however, was in financial trouble. They had to cancel deals with both Mattel and Marvel Entertainment. Cannon had already spent $2 million on costumes and sets for both movies. They decided to write a new project to recoup the money spent on them. Then Pyun wrote the storyline for \"Cyborg\" in one weekend. The movie was shot for less than $500,000 and filmed in 23 days. It was shot entirely in Wilmington, North Carolina.\nJackson \"Rock\" Pinckney, who played one of Fender's pirates, lost his eye during filming when Jean-Claude Van Damme struck his eye with a prop knife. Pinckney sued Van Damme in a North Carolina court and was awarded $485,000.\nViolent scenes were removed from the movie to achieve an R rating rather than an X rating. That included a throat slitting and some blood and gore in the village massacre. Also removed was the death of a man Van Damme was fighting.\nReception.\nThe movie got negative reviews from movie critics. However, the movie was successful in the box office. It got back over $10 million total.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Martial_arts","surface_form":"martial arts","offset":19},{"uri":"Science_fiction_movie","surface_form":"science fiction movie","offset":36},{"uri":"Apocalypse","surface_form":"apocalyptic","offset":83},{"uri":"Cannon_Films","surface_form":"Cannon Films","offset":114},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"sequel","offset":149},{"uri":"He-Man","surface_form":"He-Man","offset":168},{"uri":"Masters_of_the_Universe","surface_form":"Masters of the Universe","offset":182},{"uri":"Spider_Man","surface_form":"Spider Man","offset":237},{"uri":"Albert_Pyun","surface_form":"Albert Pyun","offset":306},{"uri":"Mattel","surface_form":"Mattel","offset":397},{"uri":"Marvel_Entertainment","surface_form":"Marvel Entertainment","offset":408},{"uri":"Costume","surface_form":"costume","offset":469},{"uri":"Wilmington%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Wilmington, North Carolina","offset":723},{"uri":"Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system","surface_form":"R rating","offset":1034},{"uri":"X_rating","surface_form":"X rating","offset":1058},{"uri":"Box_office","surface_form":"box office","offset":1312}]}
