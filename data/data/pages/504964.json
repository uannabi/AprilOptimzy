{"id":504964,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg","text":"e=\"preserve\">A cyborg (short for \"cybernetic organism\") is a theoretical or fictional being with both organic and manufactured parts.\nThe term was coined in 1960. D.S. Halacy's \"Cyborg: evolution of the superman\" in 1965 spoke of a \"new frontier\" that was \"not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' \u2013 a bridge...between mind and matter\".\nThe term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic. It is often applied to an organism that has restored or enhanced abilities, done by some artificial part, by or technology that relies on some sort of feedback.\nWhile cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism and the term \"cybernetic organism\" has been applied loosely to all sorts of things. The term can also apply to micro-organisms which are modified to perform at higher levels than their unmodified counterparts. It is thought that cyborg technology may form a part of humanity's future.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cybernetics","surface_form":"cybernetic","offset":34},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":45},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufactured","offset":114},{"uri":"Bionic","surface_form":"bionic","offset":431},{"uri":"Feedback","surface_form":"feedback","offset":590},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":641},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":693}]}
