{"id":50518,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project","text":"A project is a temporary undertaken to create a unique product or service.\nOrigin.\nThe word \"project\" comes from the Latin word \"projectum\" from \"projicere\", \"to throw something forwards\" which in turn comes from \"pro-\", which denotes something that precedes the action of the next part of the word in time (paralleling the Greek \u03C0\u03C1\u03CC) and \"jacere\", \"to throw\". The word \"project\" thus actually originally meant \"something that comes before anything else is done\". When the word was initially adopted, it referred to a plan of something, not to the act of actually carrying this plan out. Something performed in accordance with a project was called an object. This use of \"project\" changed in the 1950s when several techniques for project management were introduced. With this advent the word slightly changed meaning to cover both projects and objects. However, in certain projects there may still exist so called \"objects\" and \"object leaders\", reflecting the older use of the words.\nCharacteristics.\nProjects differ from operations, because operations are continuous and repeating (projects are temporary), and operations deliver the same or almost the same results (project results are in contrast unique).\nA project usually needs resources to deliver its results. Most of the time project execution is based on detailed plan, which considers also external factors and constraints. Planning, execution and controlling of project is the primary field of project management. For major projects it is necessary sometimes to set up a special temporary organization, consisting of a project team and one or more work teams.\nMajor projects can be divided into subprojects, and program denotes collection of related projects.\nProject types.\nProjects can be categorised based on different aspects.\nBased on initiating or participating organisation","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"product","offset":55},{"uri":"Service","surface_form":"service","offset":66},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":117},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":324},{"uri":"Object_(task)","surface_form":"object","offset":651},{"uri":"1950s","surface_form":"1950s","offset":696},{"uri":"Project_management","surface_form":"project management","offset":730},{"uri":"Leadership","surface_form":"leaders","offset":936},{"uri":"Factors_of_production","surface_form":"resources","offset":1234},{"uri":"Constraint","surface_form":"constraint","offset":1372},{"uri":"Project_management","surface_form":"project management","offset":1456},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":1551},{"uri":"Project_team","surface_form":"project team","offset":1581},{"uri":"Work_team","surface_form":"work team","offset":1610},{"uri":"Subproject","surface_form":"subproject","offset":1657},{"uri":"Program_(management)","surface_form":"program","offset":1674}]}
