{"id":505261,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem","text":"The Rational root theorem (or rational zero theorem) is a proven idea in mathematics. It says that if the coefficients of a polynomial are integers, then one can find all of the possible rational roots by dividing each factor of the constant term by each factor of the leading coefficient. [1][2]\nanxn + an-1xn-1 + an-2xn-2 + \u2026 + a0\nAll of the possible rational roots are these: \u00B1factors of a0 / \u00B1factors of an\nThis only finds the rational roots. There may be imaginary roots. Other theorems, such as Descartes\u2019 rule of signs, help find how many imaginary roots there are for a given equation.
