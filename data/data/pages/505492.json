{"id":505492,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_flora","text":"Vaginal flora or microbiota are tiny microorganisms that are part of the healthy reproductive organs in a woman. Humans have many very small organisms that are a normal part of the human body. These microorgansims can only be seen with a microscope. These organisms are bacteria and fungi. Almost all of them do not cause sickness, but it is still normal to have them inside or outside the body.\nThese small microorganisms are called microbiota by researchers. There are microbiota in the stomach, the skin, the mouth, the eyes, and microbiota in the vagina. The microbiota in humans help to stop infections caused by other bacteria. Vaginal microbiota help keep the vagina healthy. They help prevent infection caused other bacteria. Bacteria that cause sickness or infection are called pathogens. The normal vaginal microbiota stop pathogens from growing.\nWhen a woman sees a doctor because she has fluid coming out of her vagina, the doctor might test the woman for bacteria pathogens. Pathogens can grow too fast. They can grow faster than the normal and healthy vaginal microbiota. An infection can make fluid come out of the vagina. This is called vaginal discharge. A good and healthy bacteria that keeps the vagina free from sickness is called Lactobacillus. There other good bacteria that keep the vagina healthy. Some of their names are: Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Actinomyces.\nIf a woman catches a sexually transmitted disease, it will change the vaginal microbiota. The healthy vaginal microbiota can not stop or cure a sexually transmitted infection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"microorganism","offset":37},{"uri":"Sex_organ","surface_form":"reproductive organs","offset":81},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":141},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscope","offset":238},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":270},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungi","offset":283},{"uri":"Researcher","surface_form":"researcher","offset":448},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":489},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":551},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":597},{"uri":"Prevent","surface_form":"prevent","offset":693},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":787},{"uri":"Vaginal_discharge","surface_form":"vaginal discharge","offset":1153},{"uri":"Lactobacillus","surface_form":"Lactobacillus","offset":1251},{"uri":"Sexually_transmitted_disease","surface_form":"sexually","offset":1424}]}
