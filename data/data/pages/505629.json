He invented femtochemistry and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1999.\nChemical reactions were once thought impossible to measure, because they happen in only a few femtoseconds. His Nobel award was for using laser technology to measure extremely fast chemical reactions. The laser technology showed how molecules changed during the reation. He was on the scientific advisory team for the President. Zewail encouraged basic Egyptian education and knowledge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egyptians","surface_form":"Egyptian","offset":32},{"uri":"Femtochemistry","surface_form":"femtochemistry","offset":62},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":89},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"Chemical reaction","offset":124},{"uri":"Femtoseconds","surface_form":"femtoseconds","offset":218},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":329}]}
