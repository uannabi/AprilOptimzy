The Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160\u00A0volcanoes, 29\u00A0of them still active. The peninsula has a high density of volcanoes and associated volcanic phenomena, with 29 active volcanoes being included in the six UNESCO World Heritage List sites in the volcanoes of Kamchatka group, most of them on the Kamchatka Peninsula.\nThe volcanoes of Kamchatka are a large group of volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula. 29 active volcanoes are included in six UNESCO World Heritage List sites. They are listed as the \"Volcanoes of Kamchatka group\", and most of them are on the Kamchatka Peninsula.\nThe Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160\u00A0volcanoes, including the 29\u00A0active ones.\nThe highest volcano is Klyuchevskaya Sopka (4,750\u00A0m or 15,584\u00A0ft), the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The most striking is Kronotsky, whose perfect cone was said by celebrated volcanologists Robert and Barbara Decker to be a prime candidate for the world's most beautiful volcano.\nIn the center of Kamchatka is Eurasia's world famous Geyser Valley which was partly destroyed by a massive mudslide in June 2007.\nDeep seismic events and tsunamis are fairly common. Intense volcanism is caused by the subduction of the Pacific Plate. A pair of huge earthquakes occurred off the coast on October 16, 1737, and on November 4, 1952, in magnitudes ~9.3 and 8.2 respectively. More shallow earthquakes were recorded as recently as April 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":48},{"uri":"Kamchatka_Peninsula","surface_form":"Kamchatka Peninsula","offset":74},{"uri":"Kamchatka_River","surface_form":"Kamchatka River","offset":99},{"uri":"Volcanic_belt","surface_form":"volcanic belt","offset":176},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":213},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":381},{"uri":"World_Heritage_List","surface_form":"World Heritage List","offset":388},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":540},{"uri":"Kamchatka_Peninsula","surface_form":"Kamchatka Peninsula","offset":557},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":618},{"uri":"World_Heritage_List","surface_form":"World Heritage List","offset":625},{"uri":"Kamchatka_River","surface_form":"Kamchatka River","offset":760},{"uri":"Volcanic_belt","surface_form":"volcanic belt","offset":837},{"uri":"Klyuchevskaya_Sopka","surface_form":"Klyuchevskaya Sopka","offset":938},{"uri":"Northern_hemisphere","surface_form":"northern hemisphere","offset":1016},{"uri":"Kronotsky","surface_form":"Kronotsky","offset":1058},{"uri":"Volcanology","surface_form":"volcanologists","offset":1111},{"uri":"Geyser_Valley","surface_form":"Geyser Valley","offset":1269},{"uri":"Seismology","surface_form":"seismic","offset":1351},{"uri":"Tsunami","surface_form":"tsunami","offset":1370},{"uri":"Subduction","surface_form":"subduction","offset":1433},{"uri":"Pacific_Plate","surface_form":"Pacific Plate","offset":1451},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake","offset":1481}]}
