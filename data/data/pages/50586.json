{"id":50586,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Macmillan","text":"Maurice Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton, OM, PC (10 February 1894 \u2013 29 December 1986), was a Conservative statesman. He was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1963.\nMacmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War. After the war he joined his family publishing company, then entered Parliament at the 1924 general election. After losing his seat in 1929, he regained it in 1931.\nDuring World War II, Churchill made Macmillan Minister Resident in the Mediterranean. This made him the go-between for Churchill and the British forces in North Africa and the Middle East. The Mediterranean was a major theatre of war, and Macmillan's work made his name as a serious politician.\nMacmillan became Foreign Secretary and then Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill's successor Sir Anthony Eden. When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis, Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party.\nMacmillan presided over a country becoming more affluent (rich), with low unemployment and high (but uneven) economic growth. In his Bedford speech of July 1957 he told the nation they had 'never had it so good'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_Merit","surface_form":"OM","offset":48},{"uri":"Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council","surface_form":"PC","offset":52},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative","offset":100},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":131},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":153},{"uri":"Grenadier_Guards","surface_form":"Grenadier Guards","offset":211},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":239},{"uri":"General_election","surface_form":"general election","offset":347},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":491},{"uri":"North_Africa","surface_form":"North Africa","offset":575},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":596},{"uri":"Foreign_Secretary","surface_form":"Foreign Secretary","offset":732},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","surface_form":"Chancellor of the Exchequer","offset":759},{"uri":"Anthony_Eden","surface_form":"Sir Anthony Eden","offset":815},{"uri":"Suez_Crisis","surface_form":"Suez Crisis","offset":870},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":910},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Leader of the Conservative Party","offset":929},{"uri":"Unemployment","surface_form":"unemployment","offset":1037},{"uri":"Bedford","surface_form":"Bedford","offset":1096}]}
