{"id":505861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus","text":"\"Coronavirus\" is a virus in the family Coronaviridae. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome. They have a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses is about 26 to 32 kilobases, which is extraordinarily large for an RNA virus. They infect various kinds of mammal<nowiki/>s. There are four major groups of coronaviruses, called alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The most famous coronavirus is one of the betas, the kind that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 in humans.\nThe name \"coronavirus\" comes from the Latin word \"corona\", meaning \"crown\" or \"halo\", and refers to how virions look under an electron microscopy (E.M.). They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect.\nProteins that contribute to the structure of coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N).\nCoronaviruses often stick to the hands, and the virus is often caused by people touching their hands to their mouth. It gets in the trachea and makes its way down to the lungs, where it sticks to cells and tissues to replicate itself.\nDiseases.\nCoronaviruses are believed to cause many common colds in human adults. The significance and economic impact of coronaviruses is hard to assess. Unlike rhinoviruses (another common cold virus), human coronaviruses are easy to grow in the laboratory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Viruses","surface_form":"virus","offset":19},{"uri":"Viral_envelope","surface_form":"enveloped viruses","offset":63},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":103},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":107},{"uri":"Capsid","surface_form":"capsid","offset":133},{"uri":"Helix","surface_form":"helical","offset":143},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetry","offset":151},{"uri":"RNA_virus","surface_form":"RNA virus","offset":261},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":301},{"uri":"Coronavirus_disease_2019","surface_form":"Coronavirus disease 2019","offset":472},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":546},{"uri":"Virion","surface_form":"virion","offset":612},{"uri":"Electron_microscopy","surface_form":"electron microscopy","offset":634},{"uri":"Morphology_(biology)","surface_form":"morphology","offset":746},{"uri":"Peplomer","surface_form":"peplomer","offset":791},{"uri":"Proteins","surface_form":"proteins","offset":812},{"uri":"Trachea","surface_form":"trachea","offset":1155},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":1193},{"uri":"Common_cold","surface_form":"common cold","offset":1309},{"uri":"Rhinovirus","surface_form":"rhinovirus","offset":1419},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":1505}]}
