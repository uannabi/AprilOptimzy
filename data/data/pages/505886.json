It is called 'rhinovirus' because it infects the nose. The symptoms are very well known, and affect the whole of the upper respiratory tract, that is, the nose down to the throat. Children may get six to twelve colds a year.\nThe temperature most suitable for its survival is between 33 \u2103 to 35 \u2103. This may explain why it is found in the nose, because the nasal cavity is be open to the outside air.\nThere are 99 types of rhinovirus, according to their surface proteins. The rhinovirus particles are only 30nm in diameter. This is much smaller than other viruses: many are ten times larger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":30},{"uri":"Common_cold","surface_form":"common cold","offset":73},{"uri":"Respiratory_system","surface_form":"respiratory tract","offset":209},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":258},{"uri":"Nanometre","surface_form":"nm","offset":592},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":598}]}
