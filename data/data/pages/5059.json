{"id":5059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans","text":"\"Caenorhabditis elegans\" is a species of roundworm or nematode. It is important because much research has been done on its genetics and development.\n\"C. elegans\" is about 1 mm long. The worms are not parasites, they are free-living. They live in soil and feed on bacteria. \"C. elegans\" is a model organism, used to study animal development and behavior. It is the first multicellular organism for which scientists have been able to sequence its whole genome.\n\"C. elegans\" has two types of sex: hermaphrodite and male. A hermaphrodite makes sperms when its in a larval stage and makes ova in an adult stage. A male can only make sperm. Males are a little smaller than hermaphrodites.\nStudy using \"C. elegans\" was begun in 1965 by Sydney Brenner. In laboratories, they are easy to keep alive. At 25\u00BAC, they spend 14 hours as an embryo. Animals like \"C. elegans\" that do not take long to grow and are easy to feed are usually good organisms for research.\nIn 2002, the Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Sydney Brenner, Robert Horvitz, and John Sulston for their work on how \"C. elegans's\" genes cause it to grow and cause some of its cells to die.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":30},{"uri":"Nematode","surface_form":"nematode","offset":54},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":123},{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":136},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasite","offset":200},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":263},{"uri":"Model_organism","surface_form":"model organism","offset":291},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":321},{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":328},{"uri":"Multicellular_organism","surface_form":"multicellular organism","offset":370},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":403},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":451},{"uri":"Hermaphrodite","surface_form":"hermaphrodite","offset":494},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":512},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":540},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":561},{"uri":"Ovum","surface_form":"ova","offset":584},{"uri":"Sperm","surface_form":"sperm","offset":628},{"uri":"Sydney_Brenner","surface_form":"Sydney Brenner","offset":729},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratories","offset":748},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":826},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":928},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":965},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Medicine","offset":981},{"uri":"Robert_Horvitz","surface_form":"Robert Horvitz","offset":1021},{"uri":"John_Sulston","surface_form":"John Sulston","offset":1041},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":1091},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":1136}]}
