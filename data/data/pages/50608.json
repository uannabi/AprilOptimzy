{"id":50608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation","text":"Oxidation is any chemical reaction that involves the moving of electrons. Specifically, it means the substance that gives away electrons is oxidized. Normally, this is a reaction between oxygen and a substance such as iron.\nWhen iron reacts with oxygen it forms a chemical called rust because it has been oxidized (the iron has lost some electrons) and the oxygen has been reduced (the oxygen has gained some electrons).\nFormula of rusting is: 4Fe + 3O2 \u2192 2F\u2192Fe2O3.x H2O\nOxidation is the opposite of reduction. A reduction-reaction always comes together with an oxidation-reaction. Oxidation and reduction together are called redox (reduction and oxidation). Oxygen does not have to be present in a reaction for it to be a redox-reaction.\nOxidation is the loss of electrons.\nReduction is the gain of electrons.\nIn terms of oxygen transfer, oxidation may be defined as the chemical process in which a substance gains oxygen or loses electrons and hydrogen.\nBoth reduction and oxidation go on at the same time which is a redox-reaction.\nThe loss of hydrogen atoms and the gain of oxygen atoms is known as oxidation. The gain of hydrogen atoms and the loss of oxygen atoms is known as reduction. Oxidation is gain of oxygen atoms and reduction is gain of hydrogen atoms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_change","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":17},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electrons","offset":63},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":229},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"reacts","offset":234},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":246},{"uri":"Rust","surface_form":"rust","offset":280},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reduced","offset":373},{"uri":"Opposite","surface_form":"opposite","offset":488},{"uri":"Reduction_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reduction","offset":500},{"uri":"Redox","surface_form":"redox","offset":626}]}
