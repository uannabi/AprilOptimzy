{"id":506084,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matross","text":"e=\"preserve\">A matross was a soldier of artillery. He was a member of an artillery (gun) crew. A matross ranked next below a gunner. The duty of a matross was to assist the gunners in loading, firing and sponging the guns. They were armed with muskets and bayonets. They marched with the store-wagons, acting as guards. In the American army a matross ranked as a private of artillery.\nHistory.\nMatrosses were first used in the British Army in 1639. Before that they were called gunner's assistants. In the German language a matrose means a sailor. The work assigned to the matross was considered sailor's work on a ship. It was an effort to give the assistant a respectable title. But their pay rate remained the same. In 1873 all matrosses were promoted to the rank of gunner. The rank of matross was no longer used.\nBy the War of 1812 an ideal gun crew could be up to 15 men. Each man would have a specific task in the sequence of loading and firing the artillery piece. Often a non-commissioned officer would commanded the gun crew and aimed the gun. Like the other gun crew members, the matross had a specific place to stand as he performed his duties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":40},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":73},{"uri":"Rank","surface_form":"rank","offset":105},{"uri":"Gunner_(rank)","surface_form":"gunner","offset":125},{"uri":"Musket","surface_form":"musket","offset":244},{"uri":"Bayonet","surface_form":"bayonet","offset":256},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":327},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":374},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German language","offset":506},{"uri":"Sailor","surface_form":"sailor","offset":540},{"uri":"Title","surface_form":"title","offset":674},{"uri":"War_of_1812","surface_form":"War of 1812","offset":825},{"uri":"Non-commissioned_officer","surface_form":"non-commissioned officer","offset":981}]}
