{"id":506140,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat","text":"e=\"preserve\">Snapchat is a photo sharing app. Using the app, people can take pictures, add a text or drawing and send them to a list of contacts. The service started in September 2011. At first it was intended to send selfies that would disappear quickly but people learned how to save the pictures.\nIn June 2017 the app added \"Snap Map\". Snap Map is a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map. This caused concerns over privacy and safety.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Photo","surface_form":"photo","offset":27},{"uri":"Application_software","surface_form":"app","offset":41},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"text","offset":93},{"uri":"Drawing","surface_form":"drawing","offset":101},{"uri":"Contact_network","surface_form":"list of contacts","offset":128},{"uri":"Selfie","surface_form":"selfie","offset":218}]}
