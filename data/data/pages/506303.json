{"id":506303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_Manchu","text":"Dr. Fu Manchu is a fictional character in novels by British author Sax Rohmer in the first half of the 20th century.\nThe character was also featured in cinema, television, radio, comic strips and comic books for over 90 years He is an archetype of the evil genius.\nA master criminal, Fu Manchu's murderous plots are marked by a use of biological warfare. He usually avoids guns or explosives, preferring dacoits, thuggee, and members of other secret societies as his agents. They use knives, or \"pythons and cobras\u00A0... fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli\u00A0... my black spiders\" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons.\nIn the earliest books, Fu Manchu is an agent of the secret society, the \"Si-Fan\". and is the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations of Western imperialists. In later books, he seeks control of the Si-Fan. The Si-Fan is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and white slavery. Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the \"elixir vitae\" (elixir of life), a formula he spent decades trying to perfect.\nFu Manchu is opposed by a typical English detective of the Sherlock Holmes type: Denis Nayland Smith. Fu Manchu's daughter, Fah Lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, plotting to usurp her father's position in the Si-Fan, and aiding his enemies within and outside of the organisation. Her real name is unknown; Fah lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment. She has been played by Anna May Wong, Myrna Loy, and several other actresses.\nCriticism.\nDr. Fu Manchu has been criticized as an overtly racist creation. A review in \"The Independent\", says \"These magnificently absurd books, glowing with a crazed exoticism, are really far less polar, less black-and-white, less white-and-yellow, than they first seem\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":19},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":52},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":60},{"uri":"Sax_Rohmer","surface_form":"Sax Rohmer","offset":67},{"uri":"Comic_strip","surface_form":"comic strip","offset":179},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":196},{"uri":"Archetype","surface_form":"archetype","offset":235},{"uri":"Biological_warfare","surface_form":"biological warfare","offset":335},{"uri":"Dacoity","surface_form":"dacoits","offset":404},{"uri":"Thuggee","surface_form":"thuggee","offset":413},{"uri":"Pythonidae","surface_form":"python","offset":496},{"uri":"King_Cobra","surface_form":"cobra","offset":508},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungi","offset":519},{"uri":"Bacillus","surface_form":"bacilli","offset":549},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":919},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavery","offset":940},{"uri":"Sherlock_Holmes","surface_form":"Sherlock Holmes","offset":1162},{"uri":"Anna_May_Wong","surface_form":"Anna May Wong","offset":1497},{"uri":"Myrna_Loy","surface_form":"Myrna Loy","offset":1512},{"uri":"The_Independent","surface_form":"The Independent","offset":1641}]}
