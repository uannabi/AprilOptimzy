{"id":50631,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eden","text":"Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon KG MC PC (12 June 1897 \u2013 14 January 1977) was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was better known throughout his time in office as Sir Anthony Eden.\nEden was born into a wealthy family which had owned slaves and plantations in the Caribbean. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.\nEden was one of the best-known politicians of his generation. He was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1935 by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and resigned in 1938 in protest at Chamberlain's appeasement of Adolf Hitler. He was Churchill's Foreign Secretary during World War II, and again in 19511955.\nHe had operation to remove gallstones in 1953. The operation went wrong, and his health was ruined. He became Prime Minister in 1955 when Winston Churchill retired. He stopped being Prime Minister in 1957 when Harold Macmillan replaced him. The Suez Crisis of 1956 was a critical period. This and his health led up to his resignation as Prime Minister. Eden died of liver cancer, aged 79. His widow, Clarissa Eden, Countess of Avon, was born in 1920. She is a niece of Winston Churchill.\nEden's life can be described in two halves. The first half, in the 1930s and in wartime, was brilliant. But he is often ranked among the least successful British Prime Ministers of the 20th century, although two broadly sympathetic biographies (in 1986 and 2003) have gone some way to redressing the balance of opinion. D.R. Thorpe says the Suez Crisis \"was a truly tragic end to his premiership, and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his career\".\nEden had three sons. The elder and middle sons died before him. His Earl of Avon title was inherited by the younger son, Nicholas. When Nicholas died, the title became extinct.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"KG","surface_form":"KG","offset":38},{"uri":"Military_Cross","surface_form":"MC","offset":41},{"uri":"PC","surface_form":"PC","offset":44},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":84},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":106},{"uri":"Slaves","surface_form":"slaves","offset":245},{"uri":"Plantations","surface_form":"plantations","offset":256},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":275},{"uri":"Eton_College","surface_form":"Eton College","offset":305},{"uri":"Christ_Church%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Christ Church, Oxford","offset":322},{"uri":"Foreign_Secretary","surface_form":"Foreign Secretary","offset":424},{"uri":"Neville_Chamberlain","surface_form":"Neville Chamberlain","offset":468},{"uri":"Appeasement","surface_form":"appeasement","offset":538},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":553},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":611},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"operation","offset":655},{"uri":"Gallstone","surface_form":"gallstone","offset":675},{"uri":"Winston_Churchill","surface_form":"Winston Churchill","offset":786},{"uri":"Harold_Macmillan","surface_form":"Harold Macmillan","offset":858},{"uri":"Suez_Crisis","surface_form":"Suez Crisis","offset":893},{"uri":"Liver_cancer","surface_form":"liver cancer","offset":1014},{"uri":"Widow","surface_form":"widow","offset":1041},{"uri":"Niece","surface_form":"niece","offset":1108},{"uri":"Nicholas_Eden","surface_form":"Nicholas","offset":1746}]}
