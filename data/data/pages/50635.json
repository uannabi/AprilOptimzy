He was appointed by King George III.\nHis London house, in St. James's Square, is now the home of the international affairs think tank called Chatham House.\nIn 1758, during the Seven Years' War, he came up with the strategy of blocking the St. Lawrence River so the French troops in Quebec and Montreal could not get more supplies. This weakened the French side, and helped to win the war.\nHis son, William Pitt the Younger, was also a prime minister.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":73},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":91},{"uri":"King_George_III","surface_form":"King George III","offset":126},{"uri":"St._James%27s_Square","surface_form":"St. James's Square","offset":164},{"uri":"Think_tank","surface_form":"think tank","offset":229},{"uri":"Chatham_House","surface_form":"Chatham House","offset":247},{"uri":"Seven_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Seven Years' War","offset":282},{"uri":"St._Lawrence_River","surface_form":"St. Lawrence River","offset":345},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":388},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":399},{"uri":"Supply","surface_form":"supplies","offset":427},{"uri":"William_Pitt_the_Younger","surface_form":"William Pitt the Younger","offset":504}]}
