{"id":50652,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Finland","text":"The Gulf of Finland is a body of water that points east from the Baltic Sea with Finland on its north side and Estonia on its south side. Both Finnish capital Helsinki and Estonian capital Tallinn are at shore of Gulf of Finland. At the bottom of the gulf of Finland is Russia and its most important coast city St. Petersburg.\nThe water is less salty in the eastern side of the Gulf. This is because the Neva River flows into the Gulf in the east.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":33},{"uri":"Baltic_Sea","surface_form":"Baltic Sea","offset":65},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":81},{"uri":"Estonia","surface_form":"Estonia","offset":111},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":151},{"uri":"Helsinki","surface_form":"Helsinki","offset":159},{"uri":"Tallinn","surface_form":"Tallinn","offset":189},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":270},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"St. Petersburg","offset":311},{"uri":"Neva_River","surface_form":"Neva River","offset":404}]}
