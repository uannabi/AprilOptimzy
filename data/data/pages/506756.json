{"id":506756,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul_2016_presidential_campaign","text":"The 2016 presidential campaign of Rand Paul, the junior United States Senator from Kentucky, was announced on April 7, 2015 at an event at the Galt House in Louisville, Kentucky.\nBackground.\nPaul was first elected to the U.S. Senate in the 2010, Paul's candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016 has been widely speculated of since early 2013.\nPrior to serving in public office, Paul was an ophthalmologist in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and founded the watchdog group Kentucky Taxpayers United, which sought to keep state legislators accountable on tax issues. Leading up to his formal announcement, Paul delivered several high profile speeches, which included filibustering the nomination of CIA Director John Brennan, speeches at Berkeley and Howard University, and meeting with community leaders in Ferguson, Missouri and Detroit, Michigan, in what has been described as an attempt to broaden the Republican Party's appeal with non-traditional constituencies.\nNear the end of 2014, Paul made moves towards a presidential run, including hiring staff in several states, setting up offices, and hiring a campaign manager. In January 2015, Rand Paul gained the support of Texas Republican Party Chairman Steve Munisteri.\nOut.\nAfter poor polling numbers and failing to reach 3rd place in the Iowa caucuses, Paul dropped out of the race on February 3, 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rand_Paul","surface_form":"Rand Paul","offset":34},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":56},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":83},{"uri":"Galt_House","surface_form":"Galt House","offset":143},{"uri":"Louisville%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Louisville","offset":157},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"U.S. Senate","offset":221},{"uri":"United_States_elections%2C_2010","surface_form":"2010","offset":240},{"uri":"Republican_Party_presidential_primaries%2C_2016","surface_form":"Republican nomination","offset":271},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":297},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016","offset":331},{"uri":"Ophthalmologist","surface_form":"ophthalmologist","offset":431},{"uri":"Bowling_Green%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Bowling Green","offset":450},{"uri":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","surface_form":"CIA Director","offset":731},{"uri":"John_O._Brennan","surface_form":"John Brennan","offset":744},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"Berkeley","offset":770},{"uri":"Howard_University","surface_form":"Howard University","offset":783},{"uri":"Ferguson%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Ferguson","offset":840},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":850},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":863},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":872},{"uri":"Steve_Munisteri","surface_form":"Steve Munisteri","offset":1241},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":1328}]}
