A presidential candidate in 2008, her candidacy in the 2016 election is her second bid for the presidency. She was widely seen as the front runner for the Democratic nomination, although she faced several challengers, especially Bernie Sanders.\nOn November 9, 2016, after the presidential election, Hillary Clinton had lost to Donald Trump at the U.S. Electoral College.\nBackground.\nAccording to nationwide opinion polls in early 2015, Clinton was the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. She did face other several primary election challengers. A Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll in mid-August 2015 showed Senator Bernie Sanders with a 44-37 lead over Clinton in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. And, in August 2015, Vice President Joe Biden was reported to be seriously considering a possible challenge to Clinton.\nOn July 22, 2016, Clinton announced Virginia United States senator Tim Kaine as her running mate.\nAnnouncement.\nThe Clinton campaign had planned a delayed announcement, possibly as late as July 2015. Her team decided to make the announcement earlier because of publicity about Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State. Clinton made her official announcement on the following Sunday, April 12, 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton","surface_form":"Hillary Clinton","offset":34},{"uri":"List_of_Secretaries_of_State_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"67th","offset":55},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"Secretary of State","offset":60},{"uri":"First_Lady_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"First Lady","offset":87},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":110},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":137},{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign%2C_2008","surface_form":"presidential candidate","offset":202},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":228},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016 election","offset":255},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries%2C_2016","surface_form":"Democratic nomination","offset":355},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_presidential_candidates%2C_2016","surface_form":"several challengers","offset":397},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":429},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"presidential election","offset":476},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":527},{"uri":"U.S._Electoral_College","surface_form":"U.S. Electoral College","offset":547},{"uri":"Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries","surface_form":"nationwide opinion polls","offset":596},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_presidential_candidates%2C_2016","surface_form":"several primary election challengers","offset":733},{"uri":"Senator_Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Senator Bernie Sanders","offset":845},{"uri":"Vice_President_Joe_Biden","surface_form":"Vice President Joe Biden","offset":979},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":1114},{"uri":"United_States_senator","surface_form":"United States senator","offset":1123},{"uri":"Tim_Kaine","surface_form":"Tim Kaine","offset":1145},{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton_email_system","surface_form":"private email server","offset":1374}]}
