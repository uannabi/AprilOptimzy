{"id":50677,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slideshow","text":"e=\"preserve\">Slideshow means a show of slides. It is a display of several slides for information or for artistic purposes.\nSlideshows are conducted by a presenter using an apparatus, such as a slide projector, an overhead projector or in more recent years, a computer running presentation software. The word comes from the use of slides which have been around for many years. Slides originally were projected on movie theater screens by magic lanterns as part of early movie house shows.\nThe word slideshow does not appear in the \"Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Unabridged Dictionary\" (1973 edition), but is accepted as correct spelling in Microsoft Word in both \"Office 2000\" and \"Office XP\" editions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Show","surface_form":"show","offset":31},{"uri":"Slide","surface_form":"slide","offset":39},{"uri":"Display","surface_form":"display","offset":55},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":85},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":104},{"uri":"Slide_projector","surface_form":"slide projector","offset":193},{"uri":"Overhead_projector","surface_form":"overhead projector","offset":213},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":259},{"uri":"Presentation_software","surface_form":"presentation software","offset":276},{"uri":"Slide","surface_form":"slide","offset":330},{"uri":"Magic_lantern","surface_form":"magic lantern","offset":437},{"uri":"Movie_house","surface_form":"movie house","offset":469},{"uri":"Spelling","surface_form":"spelling","offset":629},{"uri":"Microsoft_Word","surface_form":"Microsoft Word","offset":641}]}
