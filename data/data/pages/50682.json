{"id":50682,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_projector","text":"A slide projector is a device that is used to view photographic slides by using optical and mechanical\nmethods. It contains an electric light bulb. focusing lenses.\nreflector and condensing lenses. a holder that holds the slide.\nA flat piece of heat absorbing glass is often placed between the condensing lens and the slide, to avoid damaging the slide. This glass absorbs infrared. Light passes through the transparent slide and lens, and the resulting image is enlarged and projected onto a screen. So the audience can view its reflection.\nThe image may be projected onto a translucent \"rear projection\" screen. That is used for continuous automatic display for close viewing. This form of projection also avoids that people who look at the show interrupt the light stream or bump into the projector.\nSlide projectors were common in the 1950s and 1960s as a form of entertainment; family members and friends would gather to view slideshows.\nIn-home photographic slides and slide projectors have largely been replaced by low cost paper prints, digital cameras, DVD media, video display monitors and digital projectors.\nAs of October 2004, \"Kodak\" no longer manufactures slide projectors. It is also increasingly difficult in some countries to locate photo processors who will process slide film. this is how to make an easy and cheap slide projector at home !! this can be also used for projects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":373},{"uri":"Transparency","surface_form":"transparent","offset":408},{"uri":"Movie_screen","surface_form":"screen","offset":493},{"uri":"Digital_camera","surface_form":"digital camera","offset":1045},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":1062}]}
