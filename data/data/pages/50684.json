{"id":50684,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_projector","text":"A video projector takes a video signal and projects the corresponding image on a screen using a lens system. All video projectors use a very bright light to project the image, and most modern ones can correct any curves, blurriness, and other inconsistencies through manual settings. Video projectors are widely used for conference room presentations, classroom training, and home theatre applications.\nA video projector may also be built into a cabinet with a rear-projection screen to form a single unified display device, now popular for \u201Chome theater\u201D applications.\nCommon display resolutions for a portable projector include SVGA (800\u00D7600 pixels), XGA (1024\u00D7768 pixels), and 720p (1280\u00D7720 pixels).\nThe cost of a device is not only determined by its resolution, but also by its light output, acoustic noise output, contrast, and other characteristics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":26},{"uri":"Signal","surface_form":"signal","offset":32},{"uri":"Screen","surface_form":"screen","offset":81},{"uri":"Lens_(optics)","surface_form":"lens","offset":96},{"uri":"Presentation","surface_form":"presentation","offset":337},{"uri":"Home_theatre","surface_form":"home theatre","offset":376},{"uri":"Display_resolution","surface_form":"display resolution","offset":577},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pixel","offset":644}]}
