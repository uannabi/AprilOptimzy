It is north-east of the Lake Constance.\nHistory.\nThe city was first called \"Wangun\" in the year of 815. During the Middle Ages, the city growed a lot thanks to its location near many Alpine cities. The extra money that the city earned from its trade helped expand its borders.\nIn 1802, Wangen joined the Kingdom of Bavaria and lost its independence. Wangen was put into the Kingdom of W\u00FCrttemberg in 1810.\nIn 1936, the city was officially named \"Wangen in Allg\u00E4u.\"\nFrom 1938 to 1972, Wangen was the capital of the Wangen rural district.
