{"id":507121,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone","text":"A feature phone is a\u00A0type of mobile phone.\u00A0The\u00A0name \"feature phone\"\u00A0usually\u00A0means\u00A0the phone cannot do\u00A0things that\u00A0a\u00A0smartphone\u00A0can do. Feature phones\u00A0basically allow people to make\u00A0phone calls\u00A0and sent text messages,\u00A0while a few may also be able\u00A0to play\u00A0multimedia and access the\u00A0internet\u00A0and other services offered by the user's wireless service provider.\nModern feature phones\u00A0can have smartphone-like\u00A03G connectivity, touchscreens, and access to popular social networking services. However,\u00A0these phones do not support\u00A0software\u00A0made by other companies\u00A0as much as\u00A0smartphones\u2014because of this, feature phones are also\u00A0called dumb phones.\nPeople often buy feature phones\u00A0as they are cheaper than\u00A0smartphones, especially in emerging markets. In the past few years, however, phone makers have begun to\u00A0make and sell\u00A0cheap smartphones for sale in places where\u00A0high-end smartphones are not popular.\nAs a result, as of 2015, feature phones\u00A0are now\u00A0considered very low quality\u00A0products.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":29},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":116},{"uri":"Multimedia","surface_form":"multimedia","offset":254},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":280},{"uri":"3G","surface_form":"3G","offset":404},{"uri":"Touchscreen","surface_form":"touchscreens","offset":421},{"uri":"Social_network_service","surface_form":"social networking services","offset":457},{"uri":"Mobile_app","surface_form":"software","offset":522},{"uri":"Emerging_market","surface_form":"emerging markets","offset":723}]}
