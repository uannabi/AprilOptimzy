{"id":507125,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_Lambda_platform","text":"GM Lambda platform is a car platform designed and used by General Motors. It is a full-size crossover platform. Lambda is based on the earlier GM Epsilon platform. The Lambda platform replaces GM's U minivan platform and the GMT360 SUV platform. This is used for the Chevrolet Malibu sedan and other similar models. The Lambda architecture is used by the Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia.\nThe Buick Enclave concept car was previewed at the 2006 North American International Auto Show. The Saturn Outlook was shown at the 2006 New York Auto Show. The 2007 Outlook and GMC Acadia went into production in late 2006. This was followed by the 2008 Enclave in mid-2007, and the 2009 Chevrolet Traverse in mid-2008.\nLambda vehicles feature easily accessible three-row seating. They were supplied with the LY7 3.6-liter V6. Starting with the 2009 model year all Lambda vehicles have GM LLT 3.6-liter gasoline direct injection engine for improved fuel efficiency, horsepower and torque. It is unlikely GM will offer a V8 engine for Lambda. The platform has been designed for front and all-wheel drive applications. Lambda is expected to be replaced by the new GM C1XX platform.\nThe lambda-based GM vehicles are now considered America's most American vehicle. Frank DuBois, of the Washington, DC-based American University created a new model for finding out which cars have the highest percentage of American-made parts and labor. His index shows the GM Lambda platform CUVs are the most \"American made.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Car_platform","surface_form":"car platform","offset":24},{"uri":"General_Motors","surface_form":"General Motors","offset":58},{"uri":"Full-size_car","surface_form":"full-size","offset":82},{"uri":"Crossover","surface_form":"crossover","offset":92},{"uri":"GM_Epsilon_platform","surface_form":"GM Epsilon platform","offset":143},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Malibu","surface_form":"Chevrolet Malibu","offset":267},{"uri":"Car_platform","surface_form":"architecture","offset":327},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Traverse","surface_form":"Chevrolet Traverse","offset":355},{"uri":"Buick_Enclave","surface_form":"Buick Enclave","offset":375},{"uri":"Saturn_Outlook","surface_form":"Saturn Outlook","offset":390},{"uri":"GMC_Acadia","surface_form":"GMC Acadia","offset":409},{"uri":"Buick_Enclave","surface_form":"Buick Enclave","offset":425},{"uri":"Prototype","surface_form":"concept car","offset":439},{"uri":"North_American_International_Auto_Show","surface_form":"North American International Auto Show","offset":477},{"uri":"Saturn_Outlook","surface_form":"Saturn Outlook","offset":521},{"uri":"New_York_Auto_Show","surface_form":"New York Auto Show","offset":558},{"uri":"GMC_Acadia","surface_form":"GMC Acadia","offset":599},{"uri":"Buick_Enclave","surface_form":"Enclave","offset":675},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Traverse","surface_form":"Chevrolet Traverse","offset":709},{"uri":"V6","surface_form":"V6","offset":844},{"uri":"Gasoline_direct_injection","surface_form":"gasoline direct injection","offset":924},{"uri":"Front-wheel_drive","surface_form":"front","offset":1098},{"uri":"All-wheel_drive","surface_form":"all-wheel drive","offset":1108},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":1249},{"uri":"Washington%2C_DC","surface_form":"Washington, DC","offset":1303},{"uri":"American_University","surface_form":"American University","offset":1324},{"uri":"Computer_model","surface_form":"model","offset":1358},{"uri":"Labour_(economics)","surface_form":"labor","offset":1446}]}
