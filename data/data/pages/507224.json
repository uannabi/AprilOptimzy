{"id":507224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Northern_Territory","text":"The Division of Northern Territory was an Australian Electoral Division in the Northern Territory from 1922 until 2001. During this time it was the only Division in the Territory.\nThe Division was set up in 1922, as a part of the \"Northern Territory Representation Act 1922\". The Member for Northern Territory did not have full voting rights until 1968, and did not count for the purpose of forming government. Before 1936, the Member could speak in the House and take part in committee work, but could not vote. Between 1936 and 1959 the Member had limited voting on Territory laws. Between 1959 and 1968, the Member could only vote on laws that affected the Territory.\nIn December 2000, the Division was split into two new divisions, the Division of Solomon, which covered the area immediately around Darwin, and the Division of Lingiari, which covered the rest of the territory.\nOn 19 February 2003, the new Divisions were removed and a single Division was brought back. In 28 April 2004 the \"Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Act 2004\" had the effect of leaving the Northern Territory divided into two Divisions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian Electoral Division","offset":42},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":79},{"uri":"Division_of_Solomon","surface_form":"Division of Solomon","offset":740},{"uri":"Darwin%2C_Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Darwin","offset":803},{"uri":"Division_of_Lingiari","surface_form":"Division of Lingiari","offset":819}]}
