{"id":50728,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_Dose_Procedure","text":"=\"preserve\">The fixed-dose procedure (FDP) was proposed in 1984 to test a substance's acute oral toxicity using fewer animals with less suffering than the older LD50 test which was developed in 1927.\nFDP uses 10-20 animals to find the dose that produces toxicity signs but not death, and from there predicts the lethal dose. LD50 (\"lethal dose 50%\") uses 60-80 animals to find a dose that kills 50% of animals in a given time. FDP sometimes needs retesting using slightly higher or lower doses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1984","surface_form":"1984","offset":59},{"uri":"Toxicity","surface_form":"toxicity","offset":97},{"uri":"LD50","surface_form":"LD50","offset":161},{"uri":"1927","surface_form":"1927","offset":194},{"uri":"LD50","surface_form":"LD50","offset":325}]}
