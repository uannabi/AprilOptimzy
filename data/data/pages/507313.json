{"id":507313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maqil","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Maqil () were an Arabian nomadic tribe. In the 11th century they migrated from Yemen into what is now the Sahara Desert and Morocco. They mainly settled near forests and oases.\nDespite their originally small number (less than 200), they were later involved in fighting a dynasty of Sunni Muslims. They also brought change to the culture of these regions, and a new language.\nGenealogy.\nThey descend from Yoktan son of Eber, father of the Hebrews and coming from the line of Seth, son of Adam.\nHistory.\nThe exact origin of the Maqil tribe is unknown. They claimed for themselves a prestigious Banu Hashim descent from Jaafar ibn Abi Talib, son of Abu Talib and brother of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Arabian genealogists categorized them as Hilalians. Ibn Khaldun wrote that both of these versions are false, since the Banu Hashim lived in urban cities and were not nomadic nor ever wandered in desert wolds. He added that the Maqil is a name only found in Yemen.\nIbn Khaldun speculated that they were likely an Arab nomadic group from Yemen, and this is supported by bn al-Kalbi and Ibn Said.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabian","surface_form":"Arabian","offset":34},{"uri":"Nomadic_people","surface_form":"nomadic","offset":42},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":50},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":64},{"uri":"Migrate","surface_form":"migrate","offset":82},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":96},{"uri":"Sahara_Desert","surface_form":"Sahara Desert","offset":123},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":141},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":175},{"uri":"Oasis","surface_form":"oases","offset":187},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"dynasty","offset":288},{"uri":"Sunni_Muslim","surface_form":"Sunni Muslim","offset":299},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":346},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":382},{"uri":"Joktan","surface_form":"Yoktan","offset":421},{"uri":"Eber","surface_form":"Eber","offset":435},{"uri":"Hebrews","surface_form":"Hebrews","offset":455},{"uri":"Seth","surface_form":"Seth","offset":491},{"uri":"Adam","surface_form":"Adam","offset":504},{"uri":"Abu_Talib","surface_form":"Abu Talib","offset":663},{"uri":"Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib","surface_form":"Ali ibn Abi Talib","offset":688},{"uri":"Banu_Hilal","surface_form":"Hilalians","offset":748},{"uri":"Ibn_Khaldun","surface_form":"Ibn Khaldun","offset":759},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":964},{"uri":"Ibn_Khaldun","surface_form":"Ibn Khaldun","offset":971},{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":1019},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":1043}]}
