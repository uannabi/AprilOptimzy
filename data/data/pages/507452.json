{"id":507452,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_HHR","text":"The Chevrolet HHR (for \"Heritage High Roof\") was a retro-styled station wagon. It was introduced by Chevrolet at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show as a 2006 model. It was designed by Bryan Nesbitt. The HHR shared the GM Delta platform with the Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5, Saturn Ion, and Saturn Astra. In Mexico, it was sold alongside its predecessor, the Opel-sourced Chevrolet Zafira compact MPV.\nThe last HHRs were assembled in May 2011. The HHR was sold in dealerships across North America until October 2011. In the compact SUV class, the HHR was succeeded by the Chevrolet Trax in North America and Europe. The HHR was replaced in the U.S. by the Chevrolet Captiva Sport. This was a rebadged version of the Opel Antara. However, the Captiva Sport is only available as a fleet vehicle and is not available new to the general public.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Retro","surface_form":"retro","offset":51},{"uri":"Station_wagon","surface_form":"station wagon","offset":64},{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":100},{"uri":"LA_Auto_Show","surface_form":"Los Angeles Auto Show","offset":122},{"uri":"Model_year","surface_form":"model","offset":154},{"uri":"Bryan_Nesbitt","surface_form":"Bryan Nesbitt","offset":180},{"uri":"GM_Delta_platform","surface_form":"GM Delta platform","offset":214},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Cobalt","surface_form":"Chevrolet Cobalt","offset":241},{"uri":"Pontiac_G5","surface_form":"Pontiac G5","offset":259},{"uri":"Saturn_Ion","surface_form":"Saturn Ion","offset":271},{"uri":"Saturn_Astra","surface_form":"Saturn Astra","offset":287},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":304},{"uri":"Opel","surface_form":"Opel","offset":355},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Zafira","surface_form":"Chevrolet Zafira","offset":368},{"uri":"Compact_MPV","surface_form":"compact MPV","offset":385},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":479},{"uri":"Crossover","surface_form":"SUV class","offset":528},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Trax","surface_form":"Chevrolet Trax","offset":568},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":604},{"uri":"Opel_Antara","surface_form":"Opel Antara","offset":712},{"uri":"Fleet","surface_form":"fleet","offset":775}]}
