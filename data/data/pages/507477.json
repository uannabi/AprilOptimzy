{"id":507477,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Heinroth","text":"e=\"preserve\">Oskar Heinroth (Mainz-Kastel, 1 March 1871 \u2013 Berlin, 31 May 1945) was a German biologist who was one of the founders of ethology. Heinroth was director of the Berlin Zoo & Aquarium for over 30 years. He married twice, both times to colleagues: He was married to Magdalena (n\u00E9e Wiebe, 1904-1932) and, after her death, to Katharina (n\u00E9e Berger, 1933-1945).\nHis studies of behaviour in the Anatidae (ducks and geese) showed their instinctive behaviour patterns. He also rediscovered the phenomenon of imprinting, reported in the 19th century by Douglas Spalding but not followed up at the time. Heinroth showed that the behaviour of birds was characteristic of a species, as much as its anatomy.\nHis results were popularised by Konrad Lorenz, whose mentor he was. Lorenz regarded Heinroth as the true founder of the study of animal behaviour as a branch of zoology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mainz","surface_form":"Mainz","offset":29},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":58},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":85},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biologist","offset":92},{"uri":"Ethology","surface_form":"ethology","offset":133},{"uri":"Berlin_Zoo","surface_form":"Berlin Zoo","offset":172},{"uri":"Aquarium","surface_form":"Aquarium","offset":185},{"uri":"Anatidae","surface_form":"Anatidae","offset":400},{"uri":"Ducks","surface_form":"ducks","offset":410},{"uri":"Geese","surface_form":"geese","offset":420},{"uri":"Instinct","surface_form":"instinct","offset":440},{"uri":"Imprinting","surface_form":"imprinting","offset":511},{"uri":"Douglas_Spalding","surface_form":"Douglas Spalding","offset":555},{"uri":"Konrad_Lorenz","surface_form":"Konrad Lorenz","offset":738},{"uri":"Animal_behaviour","surface_form":"animal behaviour","offset":835},{"uri":"Zoology","surface_form":"zoology","offset":867}]}
