{"id":507539,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincer","text":"Pincers are a hand tool used in many situations where a mechanical advantage is required. They are used to pinch, cut or pull an object. Pincers are first-class levers. Pincers differ from pliers in that the concentration of force is either to a point, or to an edge at a right angle to the handle of the tool. This allows pincers to be brought close to a surface. This is often helpful when removing nails from wood. Pincers are often called end-nippers or end-cutters. Carpenter's pincers are very well suited to these tasks. Pincers are primarily used for removing objects out of a material.\nPincers, often red-hot, have been used as an instrument of torture since the middle ages or earlier.\nPliers are a similar tool with a different type of head used for squeezing, rather than cutting and pulling.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hand_tool","surface_form":"hand tool","offset":14},{"uri":"Mechanical_advantage","surface_form":"mechanical advantage","offset":56},{"uri":"Cutting","surface_form":"cut","offset":114},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"lever","offset":161},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angle","offset":272},{"uri":"Handle_(grip)","surface_form":"handle","offset":291},{"uri":"Nail","surface_form":"nail","offset":401},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":412},{"uri":"Torture","surface_form":"torture","offset":654},{"uri":"Middle_age","surface_form":"middle age","offset":672},{"uri":"Pliers","surface_form":"Pliers","offset":696}]}
