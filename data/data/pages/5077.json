{"id":5077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Armstrong","text":"Lance Edward Armstrong (born September 18, 1971 in Plano, Texas, USA) is an American former bicycle rider. He used drugs which helped him in competition. In 2012 the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) took away all his titles from 1998 to 2006. In 2012, he was also banned forever from cycling competitions.\nBefore his titles were taken away, he won the Tour de France seven times in a row, from 1999 to 2005. He did this several years after having brain surgery, testicular surgery, and a long course of chemotherapy in 1996. The chemotherapy was to treat testicular cancer that spread to his brain and lungs. Armstrong used to race for the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, but was only team leader during the Tour de France.\nArmstrong retired from professional cycling in 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plano%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Plano, Texas","offset":51},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":65},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":76},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":92},{"uri":"Performance-enhancing_drugs","surface_form":"drugs which helped him in competition","offset":115},{"uri":"US_Anti-Doping_Agency","surface_form":"US Anti-Doping Agency","offset":166},{"uri":"Cycling","surface_form":"cycling","offset":281},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":349},{"uri":"Neurosurgery","surface_form":"brain surgery","offset":444},{"uri":"Testicle","surface_form":"testicular","offset":459},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":500},{"uri":"Testicular_cancer","surface_form":"testicular cancer","offset":552},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":589},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":599},{"uri":"Discovery_Channel_Pro_Cycling_Team","surface_form":"Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team","offset":637},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":709}]}
