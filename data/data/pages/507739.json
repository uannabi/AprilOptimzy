{"id":507739,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba_Liberal_Party","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Manitoba Liberal Party is a political party in Manitoba, Canada. The party developed in the 1880s from the Provincial Rights Party. The Liberal party won the 1915 general elections winning 40 seats out of 57 in the Legislative Assembly. This was the largest victory in Manitoba history. However, in the 1922 general elections, the Liberals lost power to the United Farmers of Manitoba. Support for the Liberal party declined in the decades after this election. From 1932 to 1961, the party merged with the Progressive Party of Manitoba as the Liberal-Progressive Party. In 1961 it changed its name back to the Liberal Party.\nIn the 1981 general elections, the party failed to win any seats at all for the first time in its history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manitoba","surface_form":"Manitoba","offset":64},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":74},{"uri":"Provincial_Rights_Party","surface_form":"Provincial Rights Party","offset":124},{"uri":"Manitoba_general_election%2C_1915","surface_form":"1915 general elections","offset":175},{"uri":"Legislative_Assembly_of_Manitoba","surface_form":"Legislative Assembly","offset":232},{"uri":"Manitoba_general_election%2C_1922","surface_form":"1922 general elections","offset":320},{"uri":"United_Farmers_of_Manitoba","surface_form":"United Farmers of Manitoba","offset":375},{"uri":"Progressive_Party_of_Manitoba","surface_form":"Progressive Party of Manitoba","offset":523},{"uri":"Liberal-Progressive","surface_form":"Liberal-Progressive Party","offset":560},{"uri":"Manitoba_general_election%2C_1981","surface_form":"1981 general elections","offset":649}]}
