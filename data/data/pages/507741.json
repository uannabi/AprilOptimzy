{"id":507741,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Manitoba","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba (or PCP) is the only right-wing political party in Manitoba, Canada. The party was founded in 1882. It formed the government for the province between 1899 and 1915. It lost power in the 1915 general election because of a scandal about the building of the Manitoba Legislative Building.\nDuring the 20th century, the PCP formed the provincial government several times. After the 1988 general election, the party formed a minority government and remained in power for several years. In the Manitoba general election, 1999, it lost power to the New Democratic Party. In the 2011 general election, the PCP formed the opposition in the Legislative Assembly, with eight seats.\nOn July 30, 2012, Brian Pallister became the party leader. He is also the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly. After the 2016 elections, the PCP won a majority government and Pallister became the Premier of Manitoba.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":81},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":92},{"uri":"Manitoba","surface_form":"Manitoba","offset":111},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":121},{"uri":"Manitoba_general_election%2C_1915","surface_form":"1915 general election","offset":246},{"uri":"Manitoba_Legislative_Building","surface_form":"Manitoba Legislative Building","offset":315},{"uri":"Manitoba_general_election%2C_1988","surface_form":"1988 general election","offset":437},{"uri":"Minority_government","surface_form":"minority government","offset":479},{"uri":"Manitoba_general_election%2C_1999","surface_form":"Manitoba general election, 1999","offset":547},{"uri":"New_Democratic_Party_of_Manitoba","surface_form":"New Democratic Party","offset":601},{"uri":"Manitoba_general_election%2C_2011","surface_form":"2011 general election","offset":630},{"uri":"Brian_Pallister","surface_form":"Brian Pallister","offset":748},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Manitoba)","surface_form":"Leader of the Opposition","offset":804},{"uri":"2016_Manitoba_general_election","surface_form":"2016 elections","offset":868},{"uri":"Majority_government","surface_form":"majority government","offset":898},{"uri":"Premier_of_Manitoba","surface_form":"Premier of Manitoba","offset":943}]}
