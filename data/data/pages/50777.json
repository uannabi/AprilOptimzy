{"id":50777,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs","text":"Steven Paul \"Steve\" Jobs (February 24, 1955\u00A0\u2013 October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, investor and co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He was the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pixar Animation Studios until it was bought by The Walt Disney Company. He was the largest shareholder at Disney and a member of Disney's Board of Directors.\nHe was seen as a leading figure in both the computer and entertainment industries. In August 2011, Jobs resigned, and was appointed Chairman of Apple. He served in that position until he died, at the age of 56, on October 5, 2011 from complications of pancreatic cancer.\nEarly life.\nSteven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, U.S. Steve Jobs' mother, Joanne Schieble was Swiss-American; his father, Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali was Syrian. Jobs was adopted at birth. His birth parents wanted Steve to be adopted by college graduates, that was not the case. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs who promised Steve would go to college. Jobs went to Reed College for a semester and then dropped out. He spent 18 more months dropping in on more creative classes. He also took part in ballet as a child.\nFounding of Apple Inc..\nSteve was a Silicon Valley businessman most famous for his work with the company Apple Computer Inc, starting with the release of the Apple I in 1976.\nTogether with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Jobs helped make the idea of the personal computer popular in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, still at Apple, Jobs was one of the first to see the potential of using a mouse to control things on a computer screen.\nOut of Apple; NeXT and Pixar.\nIn 1985, after differences of opinion about what the company should focus on, Apple's Board of Directors fired Jobs from his position with the company. He then started NeXT, a computer platform development company which dealt with higher education and business markets.\nIn 1986, Jobs bought a computer animation studio from film director George Lucas called Pixar. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006, and gained a seat on the Disney board of directors. Pixar went on to make numerous hugely successful films, such as \"Toy Story\" (1995), \"Monsters, Inc.\" (2001) and \"Cars\" (2006). Jobs made more money with Pixar than he did while he was with Apple in the 1970s and 80s.\nReturn to Apple, introduction of new products and retirement.\nApple's 1997 buyout of NeXT brought Jobs back to the company he co-founded where he worked as the Chief Executive Officer, and was paid $1m per year. He concentrated on making the company profitable again and cancelled a few unprofitable projects, and was a guiding force behind the creation of the iPod, released in 2001; the iPhone, released in 2007; and the iPad, released in 2010.\nDue to increasing health problems, Jobs retired as CEO of Apple on August 24, 2011, and suggested Tim Cook as his successor. However, Jobs continued as the chairman of the Apple Inc.'s Board of Directors.\nPersonal life.\nJobs had health problems for the last few years and had a liver transplant. When he died of respiratory arrest caused by pancreatic cancer in 2011 in Palo Alto, California, he was worth $8.3 billion.\nJobs has four children. His two daughters, Erin Siena Jobs and Eve Jobs, and a son, Reed Paul Jobs, with his wife, Laurene Powell; and a daughter Lisa Brennan Jobs while in a previous relationship with Chrisann Brennan.\nHe was a Democrat and a supporter of Barack Obama, even though, as the owner of a multinational corporation, he took many views of business-friendly Republicans. Jobs also once said that he voted for Ronald Reagan\nSteve Jobs has been played by American actor Ashton Kutcher in the 2013 movie \"Jobs\" and by German-born Irish actor Michael Fassbender in the 2015 movie \"Steve Jobs.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American","surface_form":"American","offset":70},{"uri":"Businessperson","surface_form":"businessman","offset":79},{"uri":"CEO","surface_form":"CEO","offset":120},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple Inc.","offset":127},{"uri":"Chief_Executive_Officer","surface_form":"Chief Executive Officer","offset":149},{"uri":"Pixar","surface_form":"Pixar Animation Studios","offset":182},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"The Walt Disney Company","offset":229},{"uri":"Shareholder","surface_form":"shareholder","offset":273},{"uri":"Board_of_Directors","surface_form":"Board of Directors","offset":320},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":384},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":397},{"uri":"Pancreatic_cancer","surface_form":"pancreatic cancer","offset":592},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":674},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":689},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":701},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":805},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adopted","offset":822},{"uri":"Silicon_Valley","surface_form":"Silicon Valley","offset":1209},{"uri":"Apple_I","surface_form":"Apple I","offset":1331},{"uri":"Steve_Wozniak","surface_form":"Steve Wozniak","offset":1379},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"personal computer","offset":1427},{"uri":"Computer_mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":1566},{"uri":"NEXTSTEP","surface_form":"NeXT","offset":1810},{"uri":"George_Lucas","surface_form":"George Lucas","offset":1980},{"uri":"Pixar","surface_form":"Pixar","offset":2000},{"uri":"Board_of_directors","surface_form":"board of directors","offset":2074},{"uri":"Toy_Story","surface_form":"Toy Story","offset":2159},{"uri":"Monsters%2C_Inc.","surface_form":"Monsters, Inc.","offset":2179},{"uri":"Cars_(movie)","surface_form":"Cars","offset":2207},{"uri":"Buyout","surface_form":"buyout","offset":2386},{"uri":"CEO","surface_form":"Chief Executive Officer","offset":2471},{"uri":"IPod","surface_form":"iPod","offset":2672},{"uri":"IPhone","surface_form":"iPhone","offset":2700},{"uri":"IPad","surface_form":"iPad","offset":2734},{"uri":"Tim_Cook","surface_form":"Tim Cook","offset":2856},{"uri":"Successor","surface_form":"successor","offset":2872},{"uri":"Chairman","surface_form":"chairman","offset":2914},{"uri":"Board_of_Directors","surface_form":"Board of Directors","offset":2943},{"uri":"Pancreatic_cancer","surface_form":"pancreatic cancer","offset":3099},{"uri":"Palo_Alto%2C_California","surface_form":"Palo Alto","offset":3128},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":3139},{"uri":"Laurene_Powell","surface_form":"Laurene Powell","offset":3293},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":3407},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":3435},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":3598},{"uri":"Ashton_Kutcher","surface_form":"Ashton Kutcher","offset":3657},{"uri":"Jobs_(movie)","surface_form":"Jobs","offset":3691},{"uri":"Michael_Fassbender","surface_form":"Michael Fassbender","offset":3728},{"uri":"%27%27Steve_Jobs%27%27","surface_form":"Steve Jobs","offset":3766}]}
