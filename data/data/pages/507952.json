{"id":507952,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights","text":"e=\"preserve\">Fundamental rights are a set of rights that are recognized under the laws of a country to protect their citizens.\nThese laws protect these rights even from the governments themselves. These protected rights include the right to life, right to freedom, and the right to free will. Other generally agreed upon examples of fundamental rights include freedom of religion, the right to free speech, the right to travel and the pursuit of Happiness. Fundamental rights are different from human rights. Fundamental rights are those protected by laws of a jurisdiction. Human rights are usually not enforceable by courts. Sometimes fundamental needs are associated with the concept of maslowism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":45},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":82},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":92},{"uri":"Citizens","surface_form":"citizens","offset":117},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":173},{"uri":"Right_to_life","surface_form":"right to life","offset":232},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"freedom","offset":256},{"uri":"Free_will","surface_form":"free will","offset":282},{"uri":"Freedom_of_religion","surface_form":"freedom of religion","offset":360},{"uri":"Free_speech","surface_form":"free speech","offset":394},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":420},{"uri":"Life%2C_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness","surface_form":"pursuit of Happiness","offset":435},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":495},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":561},{"uri":"Enforce","surface_form":"enforce","offset":604},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":619},{"uri":"Maslowism","surface_form":"maslowism","offset":690}]}
