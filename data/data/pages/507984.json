It is based on the children's book by William Joyce. The show is about a ten-year-old boy named George. After a dream one night, he wakes up and is only three inches tall. He has adventures with his friends and family. He also drives mini machines that he made with his father.\nThe series started on 25 December 1999 on PBS Kids.\nContent.\nBecause of George's very small size, everyday activities, such as working around the house or playing outside, often become exciting adventures. He mostly uses the Zooper Car to travel. It can change into a submarine or a helicopter.\nThe show has a retro-1940s look, with simple animation and colors. Most of the background music is jazz.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":49},{"uri":"William_Joyce_(writer)","surface_form":"William Joyce","offset":106},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dream","offset":180},{"uri":"PBS_Kids","surface_form":"PBS Kids","offset":388},{"uri":"Submarine","surface_form":"submarine","offset":614},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":629},{"uri":"Retro","surface_form":"retro","offset":656}]}
