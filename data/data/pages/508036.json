{"id":508036,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English","text":"=\"preserve\">Scottish English, also known as Scottish Standard English or Standard Scottish English (SSE), is a dialect of English that is spoken in Scotland. People can tell Scottish English from British English by their accents, grammar, and vocabulary.\nScottish English should not be confused with Scots, a language which is very much like, but separate from English. The Scots language itself has affected Scottish English by means of contact with the Standard English after the 17th century. Still, many speakers of both Scots and Scottish English put them into different registers and smoothly switch between the two.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":111},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":122},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":148},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":196},{"uri":"Scots","surface_form":"Scots","offset":300},{"uri":"Standard_English","surface_form":"Standard English","offset":455},{"uri":"Register_(linguistics)","surface_form":"registers","offset":576},{"uri":"Code-switching","surface_form":"switch","offset":599}]}
