{"id":508087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Progressive_Caucus","text":"The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) is a caucus in the Democratic congressional caucus in the United States Congress. The CPC is a left-leaning organization that works to advance progressive and liberal issues and positions.\nIn the 116th United States Congress, the CPC has 98 members, making it the second largest caucus within the Democratic Party and the third largest caucus in Congress. The CPC is currently co-chaired by U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA).\nHistory.\nThe CPC was created in 1991 by six members of the United States House of Representatives: U.S. Representatives Ron Dellums (D-CA), Lane Evans (D-IL), Thomas Andrews (D-ME), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT). More House Members joined shortly after, including Major Owens (D-NY), Nydia Vel\u00E1zquez (D-NY), David Bonior (D-MI), Bob Filner (D-CA), Barney Frank (D-MA), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Patsy Mink (D-HI), George Miller (D-CA), Pete Stark (D-CA), John Olver (D-MA), Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Sanders was the convener and first CPC Chairman. Bill Goold was Staff Coordinator for the Progressive Caucus in its early years until 1998.\nBudget proposal for 2012.\nIn April 2011, the Congressional Progressive Caucus released a proposed \"People's Budget\" for fiscal year 2012. Two of its supporters said: \"By having a fair tax code, by building a strong American economy, and by bringing our troops home, we achieve a budget surplus of over $30 billion by 2021 and we end up with a debt that is less than 65% of our GDP. This is what sustainability looks like\".\nMembership.\nAll members are members of the Democratic Party or caucus with the Democratic Party. In the 116th Congress, there are 97 declared Progressives, including 95 voting Representatives, one non-voting Delegate and one Senator.\nHouse members.\nGeorgia\nNew Jersey\nNew Mexico\nNew York\nNorth Carolina\nRhode Island\nWashington","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caucus","surface_form":"caucus","offset":48},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":62},{"uri":"Congressional_caucus","surface_form":"congressional caucus","offset":73},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"United States Congress","offset":101},{"uri":"Progressivism","surface_form":"progressive","offset":186},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberal","offset":202},{"uri":"116th_United_States_Congress","surface_form":"116th United States Congress","offset":239},{"uri":"Mark_Pocan","surface_form":"Mark Pocan","offset":455},{"uri":"Pramila_Jayapal","surface_form":"Pramila Jayapal","offset":477},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":560},{"uri":"Ron_Dellums","surface_form":"Ron Dellums","offset":621},{"uri":"Lane_Evans","surface_form":"Lane Evans","offset":641},{"uri":"Thomas_Andrews_(politician)","surface_form":"Thomas Andrews","offset":660},{"uri":"Peter_DeFazio","surface_form":"Peter DeFazio","offset":683},{"uri":"Maxine_Waters","surface_form":"Maxine Waters","offset":705},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":730},{"uri":"Major_Owens","surface_form":"Major Owens","offset":804},{"uri":"Nydia_Vel%C3%A1zquez","surface_form":"Nydia Vel\u00E1zquez","offset":824},{"uri":"David_Bonior","surface_form":"David Bonior","offset":848},{"uri":"Bob_Filner","surface_form":"Bob Filner","offset":869},{"uri":"Barney_Frank","surface_form":"Barney Frank","offset":888},{"uri":"Maurice_Hinchey","surface_form":"Maurice Hinchey","offset":909},{"uri":"Jim_McDermott","surface_form":"Jim McDermott","offset":933},{"uri":"Jerry_Nadler","surface_form":"Jerry Nadler","offset":955},{"uri":"Patsy_Mink","surface_form":"Patsy Mink","offset":976},{"uri":"George_Miller_(California_politician)","surface_form":"George Miller","offset":995},{"uri":"Pete_Stark","surface_form":"Pete Stark","offset":1017},{"uri":"John_Olver","surface_form":"John Olver","offset":1036},{"uri":"Lynn_Woolsey","surface_form":"Lynn Woolsey","offset":1055},{"uri":"Nancy_Pelosi","surface_form":"Nancy Pelosi","offset":1079},{"uri":"Budget_surplus","surface_form":"budget surplus","offset":1519},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":1706},{"uri":"116th_United_States_Congress","surface_form":"116th Congress","offset":1767},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":1912},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":1920},{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":1931},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":1942},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":1951},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":1966},{"uri":"Washington_(state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":1979}]}
