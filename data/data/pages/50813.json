{"id":50813,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(place)","text":"A hamlet is a small settlement, smaller than a village. Usually, all settlers in a hamlet are centered around a single economic activity. A hamlet may consist of a farm, a mill, a mine or a harbor. All the people living there would be workers on that farm, mill, mine or harbour. Hamlets, especially those with a medieval church may have resulted from a medieval village, that was abandoned for some reason.\nBecause of the small size of the settlement, there are usually no buildings which have a central or admninistratrive function. There usually is no church, town hall or pub. Roads and streets in the hamlet do not have names, most of the time.5-6 families may live there usually within a 2km radius area.\nIn Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Alsace region of France, such hamlets often have names that end in \"-wil\", \"-wil(l)er\", \"-wyhl\" or \"-viller\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":20},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":47},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":164},{"uri":"Mill_(grinding)","surface_form":"mill","offset":172},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mine","offset":180},{"uri":"Harbor","surface_form":"harbor","offset":190},{"uri":"Middle_ages","surface_form":"medieval","offset":313},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":322},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"pub","offset":576},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":714},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":723},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":732},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":752}]}
