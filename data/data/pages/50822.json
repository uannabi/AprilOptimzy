{"id":50822,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electrical_engineering)","text":"In the fields of communications, signal processing, and in electrical engineering more generally, a signal is any time-varying quantity.\nThe concept is broad, and hard to define precisely. Definitions specific to subfields are common. For example, in information theory, a \"signal\" is a codified message, i.e., the sequence of states in a communications channel that encodes a message. In a \"communications system\", a \"transmitter\" encodes a \"message\" into a signal, which is carried to a \"receiver\" by the communications \"channel\". For example, the words \"Mary had a little lamb\" might be the message spoken into a telephone. The telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical voltage signal. The signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires; and at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds.\nReferences.\nShannon, C.
