{"id":508317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy","text":"Epoxy is the end product of epoxy resins.\nIt is also a common name for the epoxide functional group, and a common name for a type of strong adhesive used for sticking things together. Typically, two resins need to be mixed together before use.\nEpoxy resins are a class of reactive polymers which contain epoxide groups. Their co-reactants are often called 'hardeners' or 'curatives', and the cross-linking reaction is referred to as 'curing'. The reaction forms a thermosetting polymer, often with strong mechanical properties as well as high temperature and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of industrial applications.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Epoxide","surface_form":"epoxide","offset":75},{"uri":"Adhesive","surface_form":"adhesive","offset":140},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":281},{"uri":"Thermosetting_polymer","surface_form":"thermosetting polymer","offset":464}]}
