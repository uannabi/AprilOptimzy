{"id":508520,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horneophyton","text":"\"Horneophyton\" is a genus of early Devonian fossil land plants. Its fossils are very common in the Rhynie chert. Both the sporophyte and a female gametophyte have been found as fossils. The sporophyte was about 20 cm tall, and the gametophyte was about 6 cm tall. It is not really a vascular plant. It had vascular tissue but the cells had thin walls.\n\"Horneophyton\" had anatomy similar to the hornworts. It is also similar to the vascular plant \"Rhynia\" which lived at the same time. It might therefore be a missing link between the Bryophytes like hornworts and the vascular plants like \"Rhynia\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":20},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"early Devonian","offset":29},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":44},{"uri":"Land_plant","surface_form":"land plant","offset":51},{"uri":"Rhynie_chert","surface_form":"Rhynie chert","offset":99},{"uri":"Sporophyte","surface_form":"sporophyte","offset":122},{"uri":"Gametophyte","surface_form":"gametophyte","offset":146},{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"vascular plant","offset":283},{"uri":"Vascular_tissue","surface_form":"vascular tissue","offset":306},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":330},{"uri":"Plant_anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":371},{"uri":"Hornwort","surface_form":"hornwort","offset":394},{"uri":"Rhynia","surface_form":"Rhynia","offset":447},{"uri":"Missing_link","surface_form":"missing link","offset":509},{"uri":"Bryophyte","surface_form":"Bryophyte","offset":534}]}
