Fifteen Directors have won Nobel Prizes.\nGreenfield controversy.\nFrom 1998 to 8 January 2010, the Director of the Royal Institution was Baroness Susan Greenfield, but following a review, the position was abolished for being \"no longer affordable\". The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a \u00A322m development programme led by Greenfield, which included refurbishment of the institution's main Albemarle Street building, and the addition of a restaurant and bar with an aim to turn the venue into a \"Groucho club for science\". The project ended \u00A33 million in debt.\nGreenfield subsequently announced that she would be suing for discrimination.\nThe RI's official statement stated it would \"continue to deliver its main charitable objectives under the direction of chief executive officer, Chris Rofe and a talented senior team including Professor Quentin Pankhurst, the Director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory, Dr Gail Cardew, the Head of Programmes and Professor Frank James, Head of Collections and Heritage\". Baroness Greenfield later dropped the discrimination case.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Humphrey_Davy","surface_form":"Humphrey Davy","offset":238},{"uri":"Michael_Faraday","surface_form":"Michael Faraday","offset":253},{"uri":"William_Henry_Bragg","surface_form":"William Henry Bragg","offset":274},{"uri":"William_Lawrence_Bragg","surface_form":"William Lawrence Bragg","offset":302},{"uri":"Max_Perutz","surface_form":"Max Perutz","offset":326},{"uri":"John_Kendrew","surface_form":"John Kendrew","offset":341},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":382},{"uri":"Susan_Greenfield","surface_form":"Baroness Susan Greenfield","offset":491},{"uri":"Groucho_club","surface_form":"Groucho club","offset":883}]}
