{"id":508679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahogany","text":"Mahogany is a hard tropical wood from the Americas. It was discovered by Europeans early in the 16th century (~1514). The wood comes from a tree, \"Swietenia mahagoni\". The tree is native to southern Florida and islands in the Caribbean including the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.\nAt first, mahogany was used by the Spanish and English to build ships.\n\"[Mahogany] has properties for that use excelling oak, and all other wood, viz. durableness, resisting gunshots, and burying the shot without splintering\".\nThe second use for mahogany was to make furniture. The Spanish were first to do this, but in the 18th and early 19th century it was much used by English workshops. This period is called \"Age of Mahogany\". Also much furniture in mahogany was made in France and other European countries.\nIt has a few special characteristics that make mahogany a helpful wood. It is strong and durable but easy to bend so is especially helpful for carpenters. Mahogany trees, although endangered, grow very tall and are so may be cut into large sheets. Also, mahogany is resistant to stains.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":19},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":28},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":42},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":199},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":226},{"uri":"The_Bahamas","surface_form":"the Bahamas","offset":246},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":259},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":265},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":278},{"uri":"Spanish_people","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":325},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":337},{"uri":"Furniture","surface_form":"furniture","offset":557},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":766},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":869},{"uri":"Carpenter","surface_form":"carpenters","offset":946},{"uri":"Stain","surface_form":"stains","offset":1082}]}
