{"id":50869,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords","text":"The House of Lords is one of the two Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom (UK). It is in London, the capital city of the UK. The other house is the House of Commons. Together the two houses form the government and parliament of the UK.\nThe House of Lords is not elected (voted for), except in the case of the holders of the seats reserved for hereditary peers (who are chosen by the House or by other hereditary peers in their parties).\nCrossbenchers.\nMany members of the House of Lords sit as \"Crossbenchers\". This means they do not support either the government or opposition parties, but instead are independent of party politics. They got their name because the benches where they sit are placed across the aisle which separates the government and opposition supporters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Houses_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Houses of Parliament","offset":37},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":65},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":95},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":107},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":154},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":205},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":220},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":268},{"uri":"Vote","surface_form":"vote","offset":277}]}
