Her father is William S\u00E1nchez. Her mother is Maria Eumelia Cordero. Her father worked for the railroad. Later, when Cuba's national railroads had problems, he worked to fix bicycles. When Sanchez was in primary school, Cuba was rich, because it received money from the Soviet Union. Later, when Sanchez was in high school and university, the Soviet Union had problems, Cuba lost the money, and Cuba's culture changed.\nSanchez went to high school in the countryside\". She wrote: \"I left high school in the countryside feeling that nothing belonged to me, not even my body. Living in shelters creates the sensation that your whole life, your privacy, your personal possessions and even your nakedness has become public property.\" Sanchez decided she wanted privacy.\nFor two years, S\u00E1nchez went to the university at Instituto Pedag\u00F3gico. She studied Spanish literature. Then she went to the Faculty of Arts and Letters in 1995. She got a degree in Hispanic philology and a specialty in contemporary Latin American literature.\nWork.\nIn 2000, Sanchez worked for Editorial Gente Nueva, a publisher of children's books. Then Sanchez worked as a Spanish teacher for German tourists in Havana.\"\nIn 2002, S\u00E1nchez went to Switzerland. Two years later, she went back to Cuba. Back in Cuba, S\u00E1nchez started the magazine \"Consenso\", later named \"Contodos\". S\u00E1nchez is also involved with the digital magazine \"Convivencia\".\nIn 2007, S\u00E1nchez went to the \"debate of the intellectuals\", a conference at the House of The Americas. It was a discussion among intellectuals about Cuba\u2019s culture. But Sanchez and others were not allowed inside, so they wrote emails. The emails became the digital magazine \"Contodos\" This was the reason S\u00E1nchez started her blog, Generation Y.\nIn November 2008, S\u00E1nchez was invited to write her blog entries on \"The Huffington Post\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cubans","surface_form":"Cuban","offset":58},{"uri":"Blog","surface_form":"blog","offset":64},{"uri":"Criticism","surface_form":"criticism","offset":84},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":169},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":245},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":313},{"uri":"International_Women_of_Courage_Award","surface_form":"International Women of Courage Award","offset":557},{"uri":"Havana","surface_form":"Havana","offset":646},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":754},{"uri":"Primary_school","surface_form":"primary school","offset":863},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":929},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":1094},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":1113},{"uri":"Privacy","surface_form":"privacy","offset":1415},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":1515},{"uri":"Philology","surface_form":"philology","offset":1614},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":1742},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":1825},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1871},{"uri":"Conference","surface_form":"conference","offset":2131},{"uri":"House_of_The_Americas","surface_form":"House of The Americas","offset":2149},{"uri":"Intellectual","surface_form":"intellectual","offset":2198},{"uri":"The_Huffington_Post","surface_form":"The Huffington Post","offset":2482}]}
