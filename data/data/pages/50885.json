{"id":50885,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletubbies","text":"\"Teletubbies\" is a British-American BBC children's television series for pre-school viewers.\nIt was a show made from 31 March 1997 to 5 January 2001. It was made by Ragdoll Productions. Ragdoll's creative director Anne Wood CBE and Andrew Davenport made the show. They wrote all 365 episodes. The show had two narrators; Tim Whitnall (for the international versions) and Rolf Saxon (for the PBS version). \"Teletubbies\" was also shown on televisions in the United States on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Public television used the show on their television network until 29 August, 2008, when it was removed from the television schedule.\nThe show made new episodes until on 5 January 2001. Years later, a new series aired in 2015.\nThe story.\nThe show takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls heard in the background. The four Teletubbies live in an earth house known as the \"Tubbytronic Superdome.\" Located in the ground, it has two entrances: a hole at the top, and a large semicircular (shaped like the half of a circle) door at the dome's foot.\nThe Teletubbies are four colourful human-like puppets acting like four multicolored toddlers. They have TV screens in their stomachs and antennas on their heads. They live with a number of human-like objects (objects with human-like characteristics) such as the Noo-noo, a blue vacuum cleaner, and the Voice Trumpets, a set of speakers shaped like shower heads.\nOn every episode, the Teletubbies do similar activities, like playful interactions between the Teletubbies and the Voice Trumpets, or the mishaps caused by the Noo-noo. That also includes the footage of live children displayed on the screens in the Teletubbies' stomachs, and a magical event that occurs once per episode. The activities are different from each episode but still very similar.\nTinky Winky.\nTinky Winky, (played by Dave Thompson, Mark Heenehan, and Simon Shelton), is the first Teletubby. He is the largest of the Teletubbies, he is Purple, and has a triangular antenna on his head. He is notable for a red magic bag he always carries. He is also found dancing in a ballet-style skirt from time to time, which is also often worn by Laa-Laa.\nDipsy.\nDipsy (played by John Simmit) is the second Teletubby. He is lime green and is called \"Dipsy\" because his straight antenna looks like a dipstick. He has a black and white furry top hat that he likes a lot. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will sometimes refuse to go along with the other Teletubbies' opinion. His face and ears are notably darker.\nLaa-Laa.\nLaa-Laa (played by Nikky Smedley) is the third Teletubby. She is yellow, has a swirly antenna and is concerned with the welfare of all. She is the best singer of all the Teletubbies, and is a \"drama queen\", party-girl, and motherly type. Her favorite thing is a bouncy, orange ball, which is almost as big as she is. She likes to sing and dance. Laa-Laa is one of the two girls in the teletubbies show.\nPo.\nPo (played by Pui Lee Fan) is the red Teletubby. She is the fourth of the Teletubbbies, and has an antenna that is round. Po is the smallest of the Teletubbies and gets into trouble the most. She also says the word \"Eh-oh\" (hello), a word used by herself and the other three Teletubbies.\nPo's favorite object is her blue and pink scooter, which she calls \"'cootuh\"(, but also \"'cooter\" or \"scootuh\"). Po often wants attention and can sometimes be mischievous and naughty when she disobeys the commands of the \"Voice Trumpets.\"\nPo can speak two languages. Those languages are English (or the broadcasting country's language) and, for counting, Cantonese. For example, she says \"Yat, yi, sam,\" which means \"One, two, three.\" She is a problem solver and the best \"spider-fighter\". Po is also a Tomboy type.\nIn the Teletubbies' house, she sleeps at the side of all the other Teletubbies and sometimes eats Tubby Toast while the others are sleeping. She is voiced by Pui Fan Lee, who can speak Cantonese as well.\nAlthough many are unsure of Po's gender, or think she is male, probably because of her scarlet/red color and tomboyish behaviour, she is explicitly female in several episodes, such as \"Dad's Portrait\" (Episode 216, first broadcast 1998) and \"Numbers: 2\" (Episode 30).\nNoo-Noo.\nNoo-Noo (played by Mark Deans) is the Teletubbies' sentient automated blue vacuum cleaner, and then he turns orange. He cleans up after the Teletubbies (\"Noo-Noo tidy up!\"). It has been shown that Noo-Noo has extraordinarily large storage capacity. He also has the ability to spit out any contents, often things that it should not have consumed in the first place such as the Teletubbies' blankets, foods, or favorite things. Then he is called \"Naughty Noo-Noo!\"\nNoo-Noo does not share the Teletubbies' enthusiasm for big hugs, resulting in Benny Hill style chase scenes around the dome when the Tubbies try to express their thankfulness, during which Noo-Noo does an impression of a Formula 1 car engine in full flight. The Teletubbies always win and give Noo-Noo a 'big-hug'.\nSupporting Characters.\nAlthough non-sentient, the other machines of the Teletubbies' house known as the Tubbytronic Superdome also play a major role in many episodes.\nThe show also features the Little Lambs, the Dog, the Butterfly, the Pink Spider, the Magic Crown, the Socks, the Vest, the Pants, the Blue Mittens and the Pink Boots and occasionally, the Trees, the Clouds and the Rabbits. The \"Birds\" are planned to be in the TV series, but only heard off-screen.\nPhysical Cast.\nThe only physical cast members are John Schwab and Sandra Dickson, who play the Voice Trumpets, Penelope Keith, who plays the Bear with Brown, Fuzzy Hair, Eric Sykes, who plays the Scary Lion with Big, Scary Teeth and Jess Smith who plays the Baby Sun, who is believed to have been around seven months old at the time of filming. Her giggle was included in the single \"Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh!\". Although not credited, this makes her technically the youngest person ever whose vocal appeared on a number one song.\nThe Teletubbies' instruments.\nEach of the Teletubbies plays a number of instruments.\nTinky Winky.\nTinky Winky started a still talked-about controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks like a woman's handbag.\nHe was first called gay by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter of July 1997 to \"The Face\", and gained the interest of Jerry Falwell in 1997 when Fallwell said that the character was a \"gay role model.\" Falwell wrote about it in his \"National Liberty Journal\". He said that in the Washington Post \"In/Out\" column someone had written that lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres was \"out\", or uncloseted, as the main gay model, while the Tinky Winky was \"in\", or closeted. Falwell said it was because of the Teletubby's purple color, the \"purse\" (British for Handbag), and the triangle antenna which all represented homosexuality. Also, Tinky Winky dances in a tu-tu, which supporters of the theory may take as evidence.\nThis caused many Christians to boycott Teletubbies because it made them think that Teletubbies support homosexuality. A February 1999 article in the \"National Liberty Journal\", published by evangelical pastor Jerry Falwell, warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a hidden homosexual symbol, because \"he is purple, the gay pride colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle, the gay pride symbol\". A spokesman for The itsy bitsy Entertainment Company, who licenses the characters in the United States, said that it was just a magic bag. \"The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him a homosexual. It's a children's show, folks. To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of outlandish\", he added.\nIn an unrelated incident reported in 2000, a girl's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said \"I got a gun\". Kenn Viselman, then chairman of The itsy bitsy Entertainment Company, said the toy was actually saying \"Again, again!\", a catchphrase from the show.\nPo.\nA girl's talking Po doll was thought to be saying \"faggot, faggot\" as well as \"fatty, fatty\". Supporters of the interpretation of Tinky Winky as gay pride symbol might take this as evidence as well. The toy was recalled and it was revealed to have said \"fidit, fidit,\" inspired by the Cantonese for \"faster, faster.\"\nThe Lion and The Bear.\nIn the episode \"See-Saw\" from (season 1) The Lion and The Bear came to Teletubbyland. The Lion is voiced by Eric Sykes and The Bear voiced by Penelope Keith. In the orginal Lion and Bear many kids was so scary by The Lion and The Bear and their parents was so angry they call BBC and told them The Lion and The Bear was so scary. In the next season they will do The Lion and The Bear again but this time with more carefull Music and more happier voice.\nSponsors.\nIn the United States of America, the show is sponsored for broadcast on television; this is a list of the companies who have sponsored the show.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":36},{"uri":"Children%27s_television_series","surface_form":"children's television
