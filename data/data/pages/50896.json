{"id":50896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act","text":"The Enabling Act (\"Erm\u00E4chtigungsgesetz\" in German) was passed by Germany's parliament (the \"Reichstag\") on 23 March 1933. It was the second major step after the Reichstag Fire Decree through which the Nazis obtained dictatorial powers using largely legal means. The Act enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the \"Reichstag\".\nThe formal name of the Enabling Act was \"Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich\" (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Empire\").\nNotes.\nThe Enabling Act was passed by the Reichstag on March 23 and proclaimed by the government the following day. Following constitutional procedure for legislation, the law was countersigned by President von Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler, Minister of Interior Frick, Foreign Minister von Neurath, and Minister of Finance von Krosigk.\nPassage of the Enabling Act.\nThe Nazis wrote the Enabling act to gain complete political power without the need of the support of a majority in the Reichstag and without the need to bargain with their coalition partners.\nPropaganda.\nIn the days leading up to the elections, the Nazis organized street violence to intimidate the opposition and to build fear of communism. The burning of the Reichstag six days before the election was the pivotal event of the campaign.\nViolence.\nLater that day, the Reichstag assembled under intimidating circumstances, with SA men swarming inside and outside the chamber. Hitler's speech emphasised the importance of Christianity in German culture. This was aimed particularly at appeasing the formerly allied Catholic Centre Party. It partly incorporated the guarantees requested by party chairman Ludwig Kaas.\nAll parties except the SPD voted in favour of the Enabling Act. With the Communist delegates removed and 26 of the SPD deputies arrested or in hiding, the final vote was 441 supporting the Enabling Act to 94 (all Social Democrats) opposed.\nConsequences.\nThe Communist Party deputies \u2013 and a few Social Democratic deputies as well \u2013 were already jailed, and the Communist mandates were declared \"dormant\" by the government shortly after the elections. The remaining free members of parliament were intimidated by the SA surrounding the parliament hall. In the end, only the Social Democrats voted against the bill.\nThe British tabloid Daily Express described the Jewish reactions of boycott against Germany as \"Judea Declares War on Germany\" (March 25, 1933).\nPresidential consequences.\nPresident von Hindenburg seemed to be pleased with Hitler's firm hand. During the cabinet conference on the Enabling Act, von Hindenburg's representative stated that the aged president was withdrawing from day-to-day affairs of government and that presidential collaboration on the laws decreed as a result of the Enabling Act would not be required.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":43},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"Reichstag","offset":92},{"uri":"Reichstag_Fire","surface_form":"Reichstag Fire","offset":161},{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":201},{"uri":"Dictatorship","surface_form":"dictatorial","offset":216},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":289},{"uri":"Volk","surface_form":"Volk","offset":451},{"uri":"Reich","surface_form":"Reich","offset":460},{"uri":"Paul_von_Hindenburg","surface_form":"von Hindenburg","offset":735},{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":762},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Frick","surface_form":"Frick","offset":791},{"uri":"Konstantin_von_Neurath","surface_form":"von Neurath","offset":815},{"uri":"Lutz_Schwerin_von_Krosigk","surface_form":"von Krosigk","offset":852},{"uri":"Majority_rule","surface_form":"support of a majority","offset":984},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"Reichstag","offset":1013},{"uri":"Reichstag_fire","surface_form":"burning of the Reichstag","offset":1240},{"uri":"Reichstag_(institution)","surface_form":"Reichstag","offset":1363},{"uri":"Sturmabteilung","surface_form":"SA men","offset":1422},{"uri":"Centre_Party","surface_form":"Centre Party","offset":1617},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"Communist Party","offset":1968},{"uri":"Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"Social Democratic","offset":2005},{"uri":"Sturmabteilung","surface_form":"SA","offset":2226},{"uri":"Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"Social Democrats","offset":2283},{"uri":"Daily_Express","surface_form":"Daily Express","offset":2344},{"uri":"Judea_Declares_War_on_Germany","surface_form":"Judea Declares War on Germany","offset":2420}]}
