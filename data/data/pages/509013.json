{"id":509013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid","text":"The geoid is a shape like the surface of the Earth. It is a 3-D geometrical shape like an orange. Shapes of this kind are called oblate spheroids, which is a kind of ellipsoid.\nIt was defined by Gauss, in 1828. It is often described as the true physical shape of the Earth. The study of Earth's measurements and shapes is called geodesy.\nFor many practical purposes, a simpler shape is used because that makes calculations easier. That shape is called a reference ellipsoid. In basic education, the shape of the Earth is described as being like an orange, a sphere but wider round the equator. This shape is produced by all celestial spinning spheres, such as stars and planets. The details differ somewhat in each individual case.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":45},{"uri":"3-D","surface_form":"3-D","offset":60},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometrical","offset":64},{"uri":"Orange_(fruit)","surface_form":"orange","offset":90},{"uri":"Oblate_spheroid","surface_form":"oblate spheroid","offset":129},{"uri":"Ellipsoid","surface_form":"ellipsoid","offset":166},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Gauss","offset":195},{"uri":"Geodesy","surface_form":"geodesy","offset":329},{"uri":"Ellipsoid","surface_form":"reference ellipsoid","offset":454},{"uri":"Celestial","surface_form":"celestial","offset":624},{"uri":"Stars","surface_form":"stars","offset":660},{"uri":"Planets","surface_form":"planets","offset":670}]}
