{"id":509211,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory","text":"e=\"preserve\">Implicit memory is a part of memory where previous experiences of how to do a task helps with doing the task again. Implicit memory is unconscious memory: the person or animal performing the task is not aware of the presence of implicit memory.\nEvidence for implicit memory occurs in priming, a process where subjects are measured by how they have improved their performance on tasks for which they have been subconsciously prepared. Implicit memory also leads to the illusion-of-truth effect. Subjects are more likely to say statements that they have already heard are true, regardless of their actual truth. In daily life, people rely on implicit memory every day in the form of procedural memory. This is the kind of memory which allows people to remember how to tie their shoes or ride a bicycle without consciously thinking about these activities. Research into implicit memory indicates that it operates through a different mental process than explicit memory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":42},{"uri":"Priming_(psychology)","surface_form":"priming","offset":297},{"uri":"Adaptive_unconscious","surface_form":"subconsciously","offset":422},{"uri":"Procedural_memory","surface_form":"procedural memory","offset":694},{"uri":"Explicit_memory","surface_form":"explicit memory","offset":963}]}
