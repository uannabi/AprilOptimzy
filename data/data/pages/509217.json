{"id":509217,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest_Botanical_Garden","text":"The Bucharest Botanical Garden () is a park in the Cotroceni neighbourhood of Bucharest, Romania. It has a surface of 17.5 hectares (including 4,000 m\u00B2 of greenhouses), and has more than 10,000 species of plants.\nThe first botanical garden in Bucharest was founded in 1860 near the Medicine Faculty by Carol Davila. Its first director was the botanist Ulrich Hoffmann, followed six years later by Dimitrie Grecescu. The garden was eventually moved to its current location in 1884 by Dimitrie Br\u00E2ndz\u0103, a Romanian botanist, and Fuchs, a Belgian landscape architect. The gardens were opened in 1891, when the building of the greenhouses finished. The garden was damaged during World War I, when it was used by the German occupation troops, and during World War II when it was hit by Anglo-American bombardments.\nIn the Garden there is a Botanical Museum in a building of the Br\u00E2ncovenesc style, located near the entrance gate, where more than 5,000 plant species are displayed, including 1,000 exotic plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":39},{"uri":"Cotroceni","surface_form":"Cotroceni","offset":51},{"uri":"Bucharest","surface_form":"Bucharest","offset":78},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":89},{"uri":"Hectare","surface_form":"hectare","offset":123},{"uri":"Greenhouse","surface_form":"greenhouse","offset":155},{"uri":"Botanical_garden","surface_form":"botanical garden","offset":223},{"uri":"Carol_Davila_University_of_Medicine_and_Pharmacy","surface_form":"Medicine Faculty","offset":282},{"uri":"Carol_Davila","surface_form":"Carol Davila","offset":302},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":343},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botanist","offset":512},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":535},{"uri":"Landscape_architect","surface_form":"landscape architect","offset":543},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":674},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German","offset":711},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":748},{"uri":"Bombing_of_Bucharest_in_World_War_II","surface_form":"Anglo-American bombardments","offset":780},{"uri":"Br%C3%A2ncovenesc_style","surface_form":"Br\u00E2ncovenesc style","offset":872}]}
