A memorial in My Lai lists the names of 504 victims.\nBefore the massacre, U.S. troops were told that all of the \"true\" civilians would be at the market and the remaining people would be members of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam. When the soldiers got to the village they did not find any NLF troops. Despite this, many troopers began to kill the villagers, mainly elderly people, women, and children.\nThe killings were stopped by an American helicopter pilot.\nThe killings were covered up by the United States Army, but eventually 26 soldiers were charged with being involved in the killings. However, only one, Lieutenant William Calley was found guilty.\nThe massacre caused public opinion in the United States to shift further towards wanting peace and wanting to get American troops out of Vietnam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"IPA","surface_form":"IPA","offset":32},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilians","offset":119},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States troops","offset":132},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":179},{"uri":"March_16","surface_form":"March 16","offset":190},{"uri":"1968","surface_form":"1968","offset":200},{"uri":"National_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_South_Vietnam","surface_form":"National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam","offset":407},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":672},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":683},{"uri":"United_States_Army","surface_form":"United States Army","offset":726},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":764},{"uri":"William_Calley","surface_form":"William Calley","offset":853},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":1023}]}
