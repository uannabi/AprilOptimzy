The Aude department is named after this river.\nIn Roman times, the Aude was called \"Atax\" by the Romans. In all likelihood the current name comes from gradual changes of \"Atax\", a word borrowed from the Celtic \"atacos\" meaning \"spirited\" or \"very fast\"\nGeography.\nThe Aude has a length of, and a drainage basin with an area of approximately.\nIts average yearly discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 41.40 cubic metres per second at Moussan.\nCourse.\nThe Aude starts in the \"Massif of Carlit\" at the Lac d'Aude at an elevation of in the commune of Les Angles (Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales department).\nFrom the Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es to Carcassonne, the river flows generally from south to north and then turns to the east. The river then flows into the Mediterranean Sea a few kilometres from Narbonne at Grau de Vendres (near Cabanes-de-Fleury) on the border between the departments of Aude and H\u00E9rault.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":32},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":57},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":92},{"uri":"Aude","surface_form":"Aude","offset":115},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman times","offset":161},{"uri":"Celtic_languages","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":314},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":407},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":472},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":483},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":493},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":547},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":555},{"uri":"Cubic_metre","surface_form":"cubic metre","offset":570},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":587},{"uri":"Moussan","surface_form":"Moussan","offset":597},{"uri":"Lac_d%27Aude","surface_form":"Lac d'Aude","offset":663},{"uri":"Les_Angles%2C_Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales","surface_form":"Les Angles","offset":711},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es-Orientales","offset":723},{"uri":"Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":765},{"uri":"Carcassonne","surface_form":"Carcassonne","offset":777},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":894},{"uri":"Narbonne","surface_form":"Narbonne","offset":934},{"uri":"Fleury%2C_Aude","surface_form":"Cabanes-de-Fleury","offset":968},{"uri":"Aude","surface_form":"Aude","offset":1028},{"uri":"H%C3%A9rault","surface_form":"H\u00E9rault","offset":1037}]}
