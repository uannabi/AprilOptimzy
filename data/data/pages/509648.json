In June of 2008 GM announced that the TrailBlazer and its siblings would be discontinued due to the decision to close Moraine Assembly. The last TrailBlazer rolled off the assembly line on December 15, 2008.\nIn 2012 the TrailBlazer name was brought back for international sales. The new TrailBlazer is built in Thailand and is to be sold in Thailand. The new TrailBlazer is built on the second generation Chevrolet Colorado chassis.

Although not a true SUV, the Traverse replaced the TrailBlazer in the US model lineup.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SUV","surface_form":"SUV","offset":55},{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":71},{"uri":"General_Motors","surface_form":"General Motors","offset":93},{"uri":"Trim_package","surface_form":"trim package","offset":130},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Blazer","surface_form":"S10 Blazer","offset":150},{"uri":"Car_model","surface_form":"model","offset":218},{"uri":"Chevrolet","surface_form":"Chevrolet","offset":292},{"uri":"Sport_utility_vehicle","surface_form":"sport utility vehicle","offset":316},{"uri":"Horsepower","surface_form":"horsepower","offset":366},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":387},{"uri":"Chassis","surface_form":"chassis","offset":419},{"uri":"Four-wheel_drive","surface_form":"four-wheel drive","offset":441},{"uri":"Disc_brake","surface_form":"disc brake","offset":482},{"uri":"Anti-lock_braking_system","surface_form":"anti-lock braking system","offset":502},{"uri":"V8_engine","surface_form":"V8 engine","offset":606},{"uri":"Aluminum","surface_form":"aluminum","offset":657},{"uri":"Wheels","surface_form":"wheels","offset":666},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":1008},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":1061},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"second generation","offset":1137},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Colorado","surface_form":"Chevrolet Colorado","offset":1155},{"uri":"Worldwide","surface_form":"worldwide","offset":1199},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1227},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Equinox","surface_form":"Equinox","offset":1288},{"uri":"Chevrolet_Traverse","surface_form":"Traverse","offset":1300},{"uri":"CUV","surface_form":"CUV","offset":1309}]}
