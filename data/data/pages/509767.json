{"id":509767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pschent","text":"The Pschent was the name of the Double Crown of Ancient Egypt. The Ancient Egyptians called it \"sekhemti\" meaning the Two Powerful Ones. The Pschent was made from the Red Deshret Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Hedjet Crown of Upper Egypt.\nThe Pschent was a symbol of the pharaoh's power over all Egypt. The design used two animals, a cobra and a vulture. The Egyptian cobra, known as the uraeus, ready to strike, was a symbol for the Lower Egyptian goddess Wadjet. The Egyptian vulture was a symbol for the Upper Egyptian goddess Nekhbet. These were placed on the front of the Pschent and called the \"Two Ladies\".\nHistory.\nThe First Dynasty pharaoh Menes is said to have invented the Pschent. The first pharoah to be shown wearing the Double Crown was Djet, in a rock inscription showing his Horus wearing it.\nThe list of kings on the Palermo Stone shows the Lower Egyptian pharaohs wearing the Red Crown. After Egypt is unified, the list shows all First Dynasty and later pharaohs wearing the Pschent. But the Cairo fragment, shows Lower Egyptian rulers wearing the Pschent.\nArchaeology.\nNone of the Egyptian crowns have survived (or been found yet). Like the Deshret and the Hedjet Crowns, the Pschent is known only from statues, paintings, inscriptions, and ancient stories.\nMythology.\nAmong the gods shown wearing the Double Crown are Horus and Atum. These both represented the pharaoh or had a special relationship to the pharaoh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crown","surface_form":"Crown","offset":39},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":48},{"uri":"Sekhem_scepter","surface_form":"\"sekhemti\"","offset":95},{"uri":"Deshret","surface_form":"Red Deshret Crown","offset":167},{"uri":"Lower_Egypt","surface_form":"Lower Egypt","offset":188},{"uri":"Hedjet","surface_form":"White Hedjet Crown","offset":208},{"uri":"Upper_Egypt","surface_form":"Upper Egypt","offset":230},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":261},{"uri":"Pharaoh","surface_form":"pharaoh","offset":275},{"uri":"Egyptian_cobra","surface_form":"Egyptian cobra","offset":363},{"uri":"Uraeus","surface_form":"uraeus","offset":392},{"uri":"Wadjet","surface_form":"Wadjet","offset":461},{"uri":"Egyptian_vulture","surface_form":"Egyptian vulture","offset":473},{"uri":"Nekhbet","surface_form":"Nekhbet","offset":534},{"uri":"Two_Ladies","surface_form":"Two Ladies","offset":605},{"uri":"First_Dynasty_of_Egypt","surface_form":"First Dynasty","offset":631},{"uri":"Menes","surface_form":"Menes","offset":653},{"uri":"Djet","surface_form":"Djet","offset":756},{"uri":"Horus","surface_form":"Horus","offset":796},{"uri":"Palermo_Stone","surface_form":"Palermo Stone","offset":839},{"uri":"Atum","surface_form":"Atum","offset":1353},{"uri":"Represent","surface_form":"represented","offset":1370}]}
