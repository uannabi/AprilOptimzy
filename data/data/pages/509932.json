It was first given out in 1999, and has since been seen as a major trophy. Before 1999, the winners of the regular season won nothing but a spot in the MLS Cup semifinals.\nOther websites.\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20070712003653/http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/exclusives/tellme/index.html?article_id=310 What is the Supporters' Shield?]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"MLS","surface_form":"MLS","offset":61},{"uri":"MLS_Cup","surface_form":"MLS Cup","offset":270}]}
