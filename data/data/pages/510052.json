In 1870, Dorney decided to convert the estate into a public attraction. Initially, the facility featured games, playground-style rides, refreshment stands, picnic groves, a hotel, and a restaurant. By the 1880s, Dorney had added a small zoo, and gardens.\nHalloween Haunt.\nHalloween Haunt is an annual event that is held from September to October. The park hires around 700 people for this event. It was originally introduced in 1998 as Halloweekends, but was rebranded Halloween Haunt in 2008.\nCurrent attractions.\nHalloween Haunt currently features 10 attractions including seven mazes and three scare zones, as well as roaming Street Talent sliders and actors, and two live mainstage shows (Blood Drums and Overlord's Resurrection).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amusement_park","surface_form":"amusement","offset":47},{"uri":"Water_park","surface_form":"water park","offset":61},{"uri":"Cedar_Fair","surface_form":"Cedar Fair","offset":94},{"uri":"Allentown%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Allentown, Pennsylvania","offset":128},{"uri":"Emmaus%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Emmaus, Pennsylvania","offset":156},{"uri":"Allentown%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Allentown","offset":313}]}
