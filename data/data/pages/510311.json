{"id":510311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_Mobile","text":"Windows 10 Mobile was a version of Microsoft Windows Windows 10 operating system. Unlike the regular Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile was meant to run on phones and tablet computers with screen sizes of 8 inches or smaller. These mobile devices used the ARM or IA-32 processor architectures.\nWindows 10 Mobile worked closely together with Windows 10 for computers. Content would be synchronized across devices, apps made for Windows 10 on PCs, Android, and iOS could be remade to work on Windows 10 Mobile, and most high-end phones allowed the user to plug in their device to a computer monitor and use a \"Computer-like\" interface with a mouse and keyboard.\nMany phones that ran on Windows Phone 8.1 were able to get a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile. It was up to manufacturers and carriers to issue the update. Certain features were not available on low-end or midrange devices.\nWindows 10 Mobile came out on March 17, 2016. It was released shortly after Windows 10 for computers, which came out on July 29, 2015. In October 2017 Microsoft stopped active development of Windows 10 Mobile, except for security updates, because few people were using it. Microsoft ceased providing security updates on January 14, 2020, the same day as for Windows 7.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["OS version"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":35},{"uri":"Windows_10","surface_form":"Windows 10","offset":53},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":64},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"phone","offset":151},{"uri":"Tablet_computer","surface_form":"tablet computer","offset":162},{"uri":"Mobile_device","surface_form":"mobile device","offset":227},{"uri":"ARM_architecture","surface_form":"ARM","offset":251},{"uri":"IA-32","surface_form":"IA-32","offset":258},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":351},{"uri":"Synchronization_(computer_science)","surface_form":"synchronized","offset":379},{"uri":"Mobile_app","surface_form":"app","offset":408},{"uri":"Android_(operating_system)","surface_form":"Android","offset":441},{"uri":"IOS","surface_form":"iOS","offset":454},{"uri":"Computer_monitor","surface_form":"computer monitor","offset":575},{"uri":"User_interface","surface_form":"interface","offset":618},{"uri":"Computer_mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":635},{"uri":"Computer_keyboard","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":645},{"uri":"Windows_Phone","surface_form":"Windows Phone","offset":679},{"uri":"Windows_7","surface_form":"Windows 7","offset":1238}]}
