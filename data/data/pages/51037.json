Its territory extends over more than 9300\u00A0km\u00B2, 25 percent of which are covered by forest.\nHistory.\nChristopher Columbus landed in what is believed to have been today's Holgu\u00EDn province on October 27, 1492. He declared that it was \"the most beautiful country human eyes had ever seen\".\nThe Holgu\u00EDn province was established in 1978, when it was split from the \"Oriente\" region.\nIllustrious Sons.\nGeneral Calixto Garc\u00EDa (1839-1898), 19th century patriot.
