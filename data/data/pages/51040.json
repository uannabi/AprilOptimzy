{"id":51040,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camag%C3%BCey_Province","text":"Camag\u00FCey is the largest of the provinces of Cuba. Its capital is Camag\u00FCey. Other towns include Florida and Nuevitas.\nCamag\u00FCey is mostly low lying, with no major hills or mountain ranges passing through the province. Numerous large cays (including what used to be one of Fidel Castro's favourite fishing spots; the Archipi\u00E9lago Jardines de la Reina) characterise both the northern and southern coasts.\nSandy beaches are found on both coasts also, and despite a large potential for tourism, the province has seen little development in that area. Exception being Santa Luc\u00EDa beach, on the North coast.\nThe economy of the Camag\u00FCey province is primarily cattle and sugar (in the north and south) farming, and the province is known for its cowboy culture, with rodeos frequently held. Chickens and rice are also farmed, and a small citrus fruit industry exists. The capital city also has one of the few breweries on the island.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Provinces_of_Cuba","surface_form":"provinces of Cuba","offset":31},{"uri":"Camag%C3%BCey","surface_form":"Camag\u00FCey","offset":65},{"uri":"Florida%2C_Cuba","surface_form":"Florida","offset":95},{"uri":"Nuevitas","surface_form":"Nuevitas","offset":107},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":170},{"uri":"Cay","surface_form":"cay","offset":231},{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":270},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":295},{"uri":"Archipi%C3%A9lago_Jardines_de_la_Reina","surface_form":"Archipi\u00E9lago Jardines de la Reina","offset":314},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":393},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":407},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":480},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":649},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":660},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":691},{"uri":"Cowboy","surface_form":"cowboy","offset":734},{"uri":"Rodeo","surface_form":"rodeo","offset":755},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"Chicken","offset":779},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":792},{"uri":"Citrus_fruit","surface_form":"citrus fruit","offset":826}]}
