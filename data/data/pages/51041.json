Its capital is Ciego de \u00C1vila, which lies on the Carretera Central (central highway), and the second city is Mor\u00F3n, farther north.\nOff the north coast of the province are a string of \"cayos\" (cays) - these islands are being developed as tourist resorts, principally Cayo Coco and Cayo Guillermo. The south coast is characterised by mangroves.\nBetween Mor\u00F3n and the north coast are several lakes, including La Laguna de Leche (the Lake of Milk, so called for its white appearance because of large lime deposits underwater) which is the largest natural lake in Cuba.\nCentral Ciego de \u00C1vila is used for cattle ranching, elsewhere in the province sugar, pineapples and citrus fruit are grown.\nThe province was separated from Camag\u00FCey Province in 1975 by Fidel Castro's government.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":42},{"uri":"Camag%C3%BCey_Province","surface_form":"Camag\u00FCey Province","offset":75},{"uri":"Ciego_de_%C3%81vila","surface_form":"Ciego de \u00C1vila","offset":109},{"uri":"Carretera_Central","surface_form":"Carretera Central","offset":143},{"uri":"Mor%C3%B3n%2C_Cuba","surface_form":"Mor\u00F3n","offset":203},{"uri":"Cay","surface_form":"cay","offset":286},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist","offset":331},{"uri":"Cayo_Coco","surface_form":"Cayo Coco","offset":360},{"uri":"Cayo_Guillermo","surface_form":"Cayo Guillermo","offset":374},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":426},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"Milk","offset":532},{"uri":"Calcium_oxide","surface_form":"lime","offset":590},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":694},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":737},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":744},{"uri":"Citrus_fruit","surface_form":"citrus fruit","offset":759},{"uri":"Camag%C3%BCey_Province","surface_form":"Camag\u00FCey Province","offset":815},{"uri":"1975","surface_form":"1975","offset":836},{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":844}]}
