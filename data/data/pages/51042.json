{"id":51042,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancti_Sp%C3%ADritus_Province","text":"Sancti Sp\u00EDritus is one of the provinces of Cuba. Its capital is the identically named Sancti Sp\u00EDritus. Another major city is Trinidad.\nThe southern coast of the province is flat, but the western portion of Sancti Sp\u00EDritus province is mountainous. The southeast has numerous mangroves and swamps.\nThe largest man made reservoir in Cuba, the Embalse Zaza, is in Sancti Sp\u00EDritus province.\nTourism is a big earner for the province, with most of the tourism revolving around the old city of Trinidad, a World Heritage listed city which has dozens of colonial buildings (and almost no 20th century architecture) dating back to the Spanish conquest in the 1500s, and, as with most of Cuba, sugarcane and cattle are important commodities. Some tobacco and rice is also grown.\nDuring the 1600s, both Dutch and British pirates attempted to take control of what is today Sancti Sp\u00EDritus province, but with little success, as the Spanish garrison held them off. From 1660 to 1680, Trinidad was plagued by pirates from Jamaica and Tortuga, and on two occasions, pirates razed the city.\nThe provinces of Cienfuegos, Sancti Sp\u00EDritus, and Villa Clara were once all part of the now defunct province of Santa Clara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Provinces_of_Cuba","surface_form":"provinces of Cuba","offset":30},{"uri":"Sancti_Sp%C3%ADritus","surface_form":"Sancti Sp\u00EDritus","offset":86},{"uri":"Trinidad%2C_Cuba","surface_form":"Trinidad","offset":125},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":234},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":274},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":288},{"uri":"Reservoir_(water)","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":317},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":330},{"uri":"Embalse_Zaza","surface_form":"Embalse Zaza","offset":340},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"Tourism","offset":386},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage","offset":498},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":625},{"uri":"1500s","surface_form":"1500s","offset":649},{"uri":"Sugarcane","surface_form":"sugarcane","offset":683},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":697},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":736},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":748},{"uri":"1600s","surface_form":"1600s","offset":779},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":791},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":801},{"uri":"Pirate","surface_form":"pirate","offset":809},{"uri":"1660","surface_form":"1660","offset":955},{"uri":"1680","surface_form":"1680","offset":963},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":1006},{"uri":"Tortuga","surface_form":"Tortuga","offset":1018},{"uri":"Cienfuegos_Province","surface_form":"Cienfuegos","offset":1090},{"uri":"Villa_Clara","surface_form":"Villa Clara","offset":1123},{"uri":"Santa_Clara_Province%2C_Cuba","surface_form":"Santa Clara","offset":1185}]}
