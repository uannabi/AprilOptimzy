{"id":51046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo_Province","text":"Pinar del R\u00EDo is one of the provinces of Cuba. It is at the western end of the island of Cuba.\nThe Pinar del R\u00EDo province has one of Cuba's three main mountain ranges, the Cordillera de Guaniguanico. The mountains are divided into the easterly Sierra del Rosario and the westerly Sierra de los Organos. These form a landscape characterised by steep sided limestone hills and flat, fertile valleys.\nThe province relies on tobacco farming, with Pinar del R\u00EDo producing 70% of Cuba's crop, used to make the cigars that are so prized overseas. The best tobacco, used for more expensive cigar brands, is grown in the flat lands of San Juan y Mart\u00EDnez. Tourism in the Vi\u00F1ales Valley is another important part of the economy.\n__TOC__","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Provinces_of_Cuba","surface_form":"provinces of Cuba","offset":28},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":89},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":151},{"uri":"Cordillera_de_Guaniguanico","surface_form":"Cordillera de Guaniguanico","offset":172},{"uri":"Sierra_del_Rosario","surface_form":"Sierra del Rosario","offset":244},{"uri":"Sierra_de_los_Organos","surface_form":"Sierra de los Organos","offset":280},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":355},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":389},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":421},{"uri":"Cigar","surface_form":"cigar","offset":504},{"uri":"San_Juan_y_Mart%C3%ADnez","surface_form":"San Juan y Mart\u00EDnez","offset":626},{"uri":"Vi%C3%B1ales_Valley","surface_form":"Vi\u00F1ales Valley","offset":662}]}
