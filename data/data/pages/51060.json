Later, the mountain was named after Charles E. Rushmore, a well-known later, after an expedition in 1885. The memorial was carved to help increase tourism in the Black Hills, where the mountain was. Doane Robinson first formed the idea in 1923. Robinson convinced many influential people in the United States government to build the memorial. Congress soon allowed construction to begin.\nAfter gaining Congress's approval, Gutzon Borglum, a famous American sculptor, was hired to begin the project.\nThe work of carving the heads began on March 3, 1925. It was completed on October 31, 1941.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":27},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":40},{"uri":"Keystone%2C_South_Dakota","surface_form":"Keystone, South Dakota","offset":54},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":84},{"uri":"President_(United_States)","surface_form":"presidents","offset":137},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":162},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":181},{"uri":"Theodore_Roosevelt","surface_form":"Theodore Roosevelt","offset":199},{"uri":"Abraham_Lincoln","surface_form":"Abraham Lincoln","offset":223},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":359},{"uri":"Lakota_people","surface_form":"Lakota Indian Tribes","offset":422},{"uri":"Charles_E._Rushmore","surface_form":"Charles E.
