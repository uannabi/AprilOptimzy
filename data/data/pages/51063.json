On the West End, was performed 1,039 times. It won two Tony Awards.\nThe musical was adapted to a movie in 1961, starring Natalie Wood. The movie won 10 Academy Awards.\nPlot.\nThe story is set in the Upper West Side neighborhood in New York City in the mid-1950s. It is a working-class neighborhood with a mixture of ethnic groups. (In the early 1960s, much of the neighborhood would be cleared to make room for Lincoln Center, which changed the neighborhood.)\nThe musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. The Sharks' members are immigrants from Puerto Rico. The Jets' members are Caucasian (their families immigrated from places like Ireland and Italy). The two gangs fight over which areas in the neighborhood belong to which gang.\nAfter meeting her at a dance, Tony falls in love with Maria. This causes more fighting between the Jets and the Sharks.\nImportance.\nThe play's dark theme, sophisticated music, long dance scenes, and focus on social problems made \"West Side Story\" a turning point in American musical theatre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical","surface_form":"musical","offset":23},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"Shakespeare's","offset":47},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":61},{"uri":"Romeo_and_Juliet","surface_form":"Romeo and Juliet","offset":68},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":132},{"uri":"Leonard_Bernstein","surface_form":"Leonard Bernstein","offset":154},{"uri":"Lyrics","surface_form":"lyrics","offset":181},{"uri":"Stephen_Sondheim","surface_form":"Stephen Sondheim","offset":204},{"uri":"Carol_Lawrence","surface_form":"Carol Lawrence","offset":233},{"uri":"Broadway","surface_form":"Broadway","offset":286},{"uri":"West_End_theatre","surface_form":"West End","offset":357},{"uri":"Tony_Award","surface_form":"Tony Award","offset":467},{"uri":"Natalie_Wood","surface_form":"Natalie Wood","offset":533},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":564},{"uri":"Upper_West_Side","surface_form":"Upper West Side","offset":610},{"uri":"Neighborhood","surface_form":"neighborhood","offset":626},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":642},{"uri":"1950s","surface_form":"1950s","offset":667},{"uri":"Working-class","surface_form":"working-class","offset":682},{"uri":"Ethnic_groups","surface_form":"ethnic groups","offset":727},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":756},{"uri":"Lincoln_Center","surface_form":"Lincoln Center","offset":822},{"uri":"Rivalry","surface_form":"rivalry","offset":896},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenage","offset":941},{"uri":"Gang","surface_form":"gangs","offset":956},{"uri":"Immigrants","surface_form":"immigrants","offset":1019},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":1035},{"uri":"Caucasian","surface_form":"Caucasian","offset":1070},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":1124},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1136},{"uri":"Theme","surface_form":"theme","offset":1371},{"uri":"Sophisticated","surface_form":"sophisticated","offset":1378},{"uri":"Musical_theatre","surface_form":"musical theatre","offset":1498}]}
