{"id":51066,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal","text":"e=\"preserve\">Thrash metal is a type of heavy metal music, one of the extreme metal types of music, that is characterised by its high speed and aggression.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of thrash metal are generally traced to the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a number of bands began incorporating the sound of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal with elements of hardcore punk and more specifically Thrashcore, creating a new genre and developing into a separate movement from punk rock. This genre is much more aggressive compared to its relative, speed metal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"heavy metal","offset":39},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":51},{"uri":"Extreme_metal","surface_form":"extreme metal","offset":69},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"speed","offset":133},{"uri":"Aggression","surface_form":"aggression","offset":143},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":225},{"uri":"1980s","surface_form":"1980s","offset":241},{"uri":"New_Wave_of_British_Heavy_Metal","surface_form":"New Wave of British Heavy Metal","offset":308},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":357},{"uri":"Thrashcore","surface_form":"Thrashcore","offset":393},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":471},{"uri":"Speed_metal","surface_form":"speed metal","offset":543}]}
