{"id":51082,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone%2C_Perth_and_Kinross","text":"Scone (\"Sg\u00E0in\"; \"Scoine\" []) is a town in Perth and Kinross, Scotland.\nThe medieval town of Scone, which grew up around the monastery and royal residence, ended in the early nineteenth century when \"Scone Palace\" was built on the site. The modern town of New Scone nowadays is simply called Scone. It has a population of over 4000 people and is a suburb of Perth.\nOld Scone was the historic capital of (Scotland). In the Middle Ages it was an important royal centre, used as a royal residence and as the coronation site of the kingdom's monarchs. Around the royal site grew the town of Perth and the Abbey of Scone.\nScone and Scotland.\nScone's role came under threat as Scotland's twelfth century kings gradually became more French and less Gaelic. Walter of Coventry reported in the reign of William I of Scotland that \"The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude.\" Though exaggerated, there was truth in this. Apparently for this reason, when the Normanized David I of Scotland (\"Dab\u00EDd mac Ma\u00EDl Choluim\") went to Scone to be crowned there in the summer of 1124, he initially refused to take part in the ceremonies.\nModern town.\nConstructing the new palace meant destroying the old town and moving its inhabitants to a new settlement. The new village was constructed in 1805 as planned town, and originally called New Scone. It lies 2km to the west of the old location and 1\u00BD km farther from Perth. Until 1997 the town was called \"New Scone\", but is now referred to simply as Scone. The town had 4,430 inhabitants according to the 2001 Census for Scotland, 84.33% of whom are Scottish; it is demographically old even compared with the rest of Scotland.\nThe site of Old Scone is mostly in the grounds of the modern palace. This palace is a popular tourist attraction. Visitors come to see the gardens in the palace grounds, the exotic birds which roam freely in the grounds, Moot Hill, which lies in the grounds, as well as the palace itself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Perth_and_Kinross","surface_form":"Perth and Kinross","offset":42},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":61},{"uri":"Perth%2C_Scotland","surface_form":"Perth","offset":357},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":403},{"uri":"Coronation","surface_form":"coronation","offset":504},{"uri":"Scone_Abbey","surface_form":"Abbey of Scone","offset":600},{"uri":"Walter_of_Coventry","surface_form":"Walter of Coventry","offset":749},{"uri":"William_I_of_Scotland","surface_form":"William I of Scotland","offset":793},{"uri":"David_I_of_Scotland","surface_form":"David I of Scotland","offset":1121},{"uri":"Scottish_people","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":1738}]}
