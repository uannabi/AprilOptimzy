{"id":51085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation","text":"A coronation is a ceremony that gives a monarch regal or royal power. The power is symbolized by putting a crown upon his or her head. We say that the king or queen is \"crowned\" at the coronation.\nThe ritual may have a religious meaning. Coronations are not as common now as in the past, although in some countries such as Great Britain it is still normal to hold the ceremony to install a new king or queen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremony","offset":18},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":40},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":83},{"uri":"Crown","surface_form":"crown","offset":107},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":151},{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"queen","offset":159},{"uri":"Ritual","surface_form":"ritual","offset":201},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":323}]}
