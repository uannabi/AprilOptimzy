{"id":511050,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Florida_Flight_90","text":"e=\"preserve\">Air Florida Flight 90 was a scheduled U.S. domestic passenger flight from Washington National Airport to Fort Lauderdale \u2013 Hollywood International Airport. On January 13, 1982, the Boeing 737-200 registered as N62AF, crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River.\nThe aircraft had originally been purchased by United Airlines in 1969 and flown with the registration number of N9050U. It was sold to Air Florida in 1980.\nThe aircraft struck the 14th Street Bridge, which carries Interstate 395 between Washington, D.C. and Arlington County, Virginia. It crushed seven occupied vehicles on the bridge and destroyed of guard rail before it plunged through the ice into the Potomac River.\nThe crash occurred less than two miles (3\u00A0km) from the White House and within view of both the Jefferson Memorial and The Pentagon. The aircraft was carrying 74 passengers and five crewmembers. Four passengers and one flight attendant survived and were rescued from the crash. Another passenger, Arland D. Williams, Jr., assisted in the rescue of the survivors but drowned before he himself could be rescued. Four motorists on the bridge were killed. The survivors were rescued from the icy river by civilians and professionals.\nPresident Ronald Reagan commended these acts during his State of the Union speech a few days later. The cause of the crash was pilot error.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport","surface_form":"Washington National Airport","offset":87},{"uri":"Fort_Lauderdale_%E2%80%93_Hollywood_International_Airport","surface_form":"Fort Lauderdale \u2013 Hollywood International Airport","offset":118},{"uri":"Boeing","surface_form":"Boeing","offset":194},{"uri":"14th_Street_Bridge_(Potomac_River)","surface_form":"14th Street Bridge","offset":247},{"uri":"Potomac_River","surface_form":"Potomac River","offset":275},{"uri":"United_Airlines","surface_form":"United Airlines","offset":336},{"uri":"Interstate_395_(District_of_Columbia-Virginia)","surface_form":"Interstate 395","offset":504},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":527},{"uri":"Arlington_County%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Arlington County, Virginia","offset":548},{"uri":"Guard_rail","surface_form":"guard rail","offset":642},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":766},{"uri":"Jefferson_Memorial","surface_form":"Jefferson Memorial","offset":806},{"uri":"The_Pentagon","surface_form":"The Pentagon","offset":829},{"uri":"Arland_D._Williams%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Arland D.
