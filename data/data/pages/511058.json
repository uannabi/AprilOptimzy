{"id":511058,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines_Flight_191","text":"Delta Air Lines Flight 191 was a regularly scheduled Delta Air Lines domestic service from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles, via Dallas that crashed on August 2, 1985, at 18:05 (). The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar operating this flight encountered a microburst while on approach to land on runway 17L (now marked 17C) at Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).\nThe pilots were unable to successfully escape the weather event, and the aircraft impacted the ground over a mile short of the runway. The flight hit a car driving north of the airport and crashed two water tanks. The crash killed 136 of the 152 passengers and 11 crew on board, and the driver of the car.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash resulted from the flight crew's decision to fly through a thunderstorm, the lack of procedures and training to avoid or escape microbursts, and the lack of hazard information on wind shear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Delta_Air_Lines","surface_form":"Delta Air Lines","offset":53},{"uri":"Fort_Lauderdale%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Fort Lauderdale, Florida","offset":91},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":119},{"uri":"Dallas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":136},{"uri":"Lockheed_L-1011_TriStar","surface_form":"Lockheed L-1011 TriStar","offset":192},{"uri":"Microburst","surface_form":"microburst","offset":252},{"uri":"Fort_Worth_International_Airport","surface_form":"Fort Worth International Airport","offset":323},{"uri":"National_Transportation_Safety_Board","surface_form":"National Transportation Safety Board","offset":673}]}
