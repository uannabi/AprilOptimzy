{"id":511070,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots","text":"e=\"preserve\">There are a numbers of ways to calculate square roots of numbers, and even more ways to estimate them.\nThe mathematical operation of finding a root is the opposite operation of exponentiation, and therefore involves a similar but reverse thought process.\nFirstly, one needs to know how precise the result is expected to be. This is because often square roots are irrational. For example, square root of a nice round whole number 28 is a fraction which in its decimal notation has infinite length, and therefore it is impossible to express it exactly:formula_1\nMoreover, for some real numbers the square root is a complex number. For example, square root of -4 is a complex number 2\"i\":formula_1\nIn many cases there may be multiple valid answers. For example, square root of 4 is 2, but -2 is also a valid answer. One can verify that they are both valid answers by squaring each candidate answer and checking if you obtain 4 as the result of verification:formula_1\nformula_1\nPlease note that calculating a square root is a special case of the problem of calculating Nth root.\nCalculating.\nMost calculators provide a function for calculation of a square root.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":54},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":70},{"uri":"Estimation","surface_form":"estimate","offset":101},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"exponentiation","offset":190},{"uri":"Arithmetic_precision","surface_form":"precise","offset":299},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":359},{"uri":"Irrational_numbers","surface_form":"irrational","offset":376},{"uri":"Whole_number","surface_form":"whole number","offset":429},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fraction","offset":450},{"uri":"Decimal_places","surface_form":"decimal notation","offset":472},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":493},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":592},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":626},{"uri":"Imaginary_unit","surface_form":"i","offset":695},{"uri":"Nth_root","surface_form":"calculating Nth root","offset":1066},{"uri":"Calculator","surface_form":"calculator","offset":1106}]}
