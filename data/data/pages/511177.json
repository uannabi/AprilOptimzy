Bournemouth after a bomb scare.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":40},{"uri":"Claudio_Ranieri","surface_form":"Claudio Ranieri","offset":150},{"uri":"Arsenal_F.C.","surface_form":"Arsenal","offset":268},{"uri":"Manchester_United_F.C.","surface_form":"Manchester United","offset":475},{"uri":"A.F.C._Bournemouth","surface_form":"A.F.C.
