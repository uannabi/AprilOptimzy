It happened in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh, India. It killed around 31 people. At least 72 people were injured.\nTwo trains passing over a small bridge both derailed within minutes of each other. The Kamayani Express was traveling to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. The other train, the Janata Express, was going in the opposite direction towards Mumbai.
