{"id":511362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition","text":"Demolition is a process in which buildings are torn down. Demolition is different from deconstruction, which is carefully taking a building apart to reuse its parts.\nFor small buildings, such as houses, demolition is often simple. Buildings are often pulled down with excavators, bulldozers or small cranes. Other specialized equipment may also be used. Larger buildings may use a wrecking ball swung by a crane. This works well for masonry buildings. Sometimes building implosion is used. This involves using carefully placed explosive charges. If done correctly, the building falls in on itself and not on nearby buildings.\nPreparation.\nBefore a building can be torn down, several things have to happen. A demolition permit has to be obtained from a city, town or county. All hazardous waste must be removed. This includes asbestos, lead paint and any flammable materials. All utilities (water, electricity and natural gas) have to be disconnected. Many municipalities have checklists of what to do before a building can be demolished. They also have checklists of things that must be removed first.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":33},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":195},{"uri":"Excavator","surface_form":"excavator","offset":268},{"uri":"Bulldozer","surface_form":"bulldozer","offset":280},{"uri":"Crane_(machine)","surface_form":"cranes","offset":300},{"uri":"Wrecking_ball","surface_form":"wrecking ball","offset":381},{"uri":"Masonry","surface_form":"masonry","offset":433},{"uri":"Building_implosion","surface_form":"building implosion","offset":462},{"uri":"Explosive_material","surface_form":"explosive charges","offset":527},{"uri":"Hazardous_waste","surface_form":"hazardous waste","offset":778},{"uri":"Asbestos","surface_form":"asbestos","offset":825},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":835},{"uri":"Flammability","surface_form":"flammable","offset":854},{"uri":"Public_utility","surface_form":"utilities","offset":879},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":897},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":913},{"uri":"Municipalities","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":956},{"uri":"List","surface_form":"list","offset":1058}]}
