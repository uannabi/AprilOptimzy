{"id":511679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_1%27s_(video)","text":"\"#1's\" is Mariah Carey's sixth VHS/DVD release. A collection of the music videos of her U.S. number-one singles (songs that reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100) up to that time, the home video was originally released on VHS in December 7, 1999, while the DVD was released in February 1, 2000. A year before this, Carey had released a greatest hits compilation, \"1's\", which included her thirteen U.S. number-one singles up to that point. The DVD of the same name is based on that album, but by the time of its release, Carey had already scored a fourteenth U.S. number one, \"Heartbreaker\", from her latest studio release \"Rainbow\". Its music video and the video of its remix (as a bonus track) were thus included on the DVD. During the month of the DVD's release, Carey had also earned her fifteenth number one single, \"Thank God I Found You\".\nThe DVD does not include the official music videos for \"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", and \"Someday\". They are replaced by live performances culled from previous DVD/video releases.\n\"#1's\" was re-released in 2008 as part of \"Mariah Carey: DVD Collection\", a 2DVD set including also '. The video features a shortened version from the original, without the introductory sections per track.\nTrack listing.\n1taken from the Columbia Music Video release \"MTV Unplugged +3\"\n2taken from the Columbia Music Video release \"Here Is Mariah Carey\"\n3edited version taken from the Columbia Music Video release '","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mariah_Carey","surface_form":"Mariah Carey","offset":10},{"uri":"VHS","surface_form":"VHS","offset":31},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":35},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":150},{"uri":"VHS","surface_form":"VHS","offset":230},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":265},{"uri":"Number_1%27s_(Mariah_Carey_album)","surface_form":"1's","offset":372},{"uri":"Heartbreaker_(Mariah_Carey_song)","surface_form":"Heartbreaker","offset":585},{"uri":"Rainbow_(Mariah_Carey_album)","surface_form":"Rainbow","offset":632},{"uri":"Thank_God_I_Found_You","surface_form":"Thank God I Found You","offset":830},{"uri":"Vision_of_Love","surface_form":"Vision of Love","offset":910},{"uri":"Love_Takes_Time","surface_form":"Love Takes Time","offset":928},{"uri":"Someday_(Mariah_Carey_song)","surface_form":"Someday","offset":951},{"uri":"MTV_Unplugged_%2B3","surface_form":"MTV Unplugged +3","offset":1308},{"uri":"Here_Is_Mariah_Carey","surface_form":"Here Is Mariah Carey","offset":1372}]}
