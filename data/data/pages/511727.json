This was also called in some cases the Principality of the Pindus, although this name is mainly used for the events of 1917 in Samarina.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":39},{"uri":"West_Macedonia","surface_form":"West Macedonia","offset":78},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":94},{"uri":"Grevena","surface_form":"Grevena","offset":172},{"uri":"Aromanians","surface_form":"Aromanians","offset":218},{"uri":"Smolikas","surface_form":"Smolikas","offset":418},{"uri":"Pindus","surface_form":"Pindus","offset":447},{"uri":"Principality_of_the_Pindus","surface_form":"Principality of the Pindus","offset":695},{"uri":"Alcibiades_Diamandi","surface_form":"Alcibiades Diamandi","offset":754},{"uri":"Nicolaos_Matussis","surface_form":"Nicolaos Matussis","offset":778},{"uri":"Vlach_%26quot%3BRoman_Legion%26quot%3B","surface_form":"Vlach \"Roman Legion\"","offset":812},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":900},{"uri":"Principality_of_the_Pindus","surface_form":"Principality of the Pindus","offset":953}]}
