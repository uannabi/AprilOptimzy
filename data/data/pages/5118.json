{"id":5118,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary","text":"Sir Edmund Hillary, (born 20 July 1919, died 11 January 2008) was a New Zealand mountaineer and explorer. He and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay were the first people to climb Mount Everest. They got to the top on 29 May 1953. Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth. During his teenage years, Hillary had attended Auckland Grammar School.\nSir Edmund Hillary's fame came as a result of being the first New Zealander in the world to conquer Mt. Everest in Nepal. He is on the New Zealand five dollar note. He also climbed ten other mountains after Mount Everest, all of which are also in the Himalayas.\nEarly life.\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus Hillary and Gertrude Hillary, n\u00E9e Clark, in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919. His family moved to Tuakau (south of Auckland) in 1920, after his father (who served at Gallipoli) had gotten land there. His grandparents were early settlers in northern Wairoa in the mid 19th century after moving from Yorkshire, England.\nHillary learned at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School. He finished primary school two years early, but he did not do very well at high school. At first, he was smaller than other students there and very shy so he felt safe with his books and often thought of a life filled with adventure. Every day, he rode a train to and from high school, and he often used this time to read. Learning how to box helped him become more confident. At age 16 his interest in climbing started during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu. Although very tall at 6\u00A0ft 5 in (195\u00A0cm), he was stronger than many of his fellow hikers.\nHe learned about mathematics and science at The University of Auckland, and in 1939 he completed his first important climb, which was reaching the top of a mountain called Mount Ollivier. With his brother Rex, Hillary became a beekeeper during summertime, which allowed him to do climbing in the winter.\nPersonal life.\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose in 1953, by whom he had a son and two daughters. In 1975, his wife and their younger daughter were killed in a plane crash. Hillary married June Mulgrew in 1989; they remained married until he died.\nDeath.\nHillary died of a heart attack in Auckland, at the age of 88.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":68},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":96},{"uri":"Sherpa","surface_form":"Sherpa","offset":113},{"uri":"Tenzing_Norgay","surface_form":"Tenzing Norgay","offset":126},{"uri":"Mount_Everest","surface_form":"Mount Everest","offset":172},{"uri":"Auckland_Grammar_School","surface_form":"Auckland Grammar School","offset":318},{"uri":"Mt._Everest","surface_form":"Mt.
