They escape from the city and stow away on the ship of Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s, while sailing to the New World. After befriending a horse named Altivo, they land off the Mexican coast. After seeing landmarks on the map, they take a direction to the legendary golden city. As they arrive at the waterfall, a woman and an army of guards recognize them as gods, and escort them to the city. There, they meet the elders, kindhearted Chief Tannabok and the malicious high priest Tzekel Kan. Tannabok welcomes the two to the city warmly, while Tzekel Kan mainly sees them as an opportunity to enhance his own standing. He also believes the gods' arrival will spark the \"Year of the Jaguar\", a time when everyone will be purged from the city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"DreamWorks_Animation","surface_form":"DreamWorks Animation","offset":76},{"uri":"Kevin_Kline","surface_form":"Kevin Kline","offset":107},{"uri":"Kenneth_Branagh","surface_form":"Kenneth Branagh","offset":120},{"uri":"Rosie_Perez","surface_form":"Rosie Perez","offset":137},{"uri":"Jim_Cummings","surface_form":"Jim Cummings","offset":150},{"uri":"Frank_Welker","surface_form":"Frank Welker","offset":164},{"uri":"Armand_Assante","surface_form":"Armand Assante","offset":178},{"uri":"Edward_James_Olmos","surface_form":"Edward James Olmos","offset":194},{"uri":"Tobin_Bell","surface_form":"Tobin Bell","offset":217},{"uri":"Elton_John","surface_form":"Elton John","offset":248},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":282},{"uri":"Box_office_bomb","surface_form":"flopped","offset":439},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":523},{"uri":"El_Dorado","surface_form":"El Dorado","offset":559},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":644},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":749},{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"waterfall","offset":873},{"uri":"Jaguar","surface_form":"Jaguar","offset":1255}]}
