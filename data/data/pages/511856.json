{"id":511856,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagrant_foul","text":"=\"preserve\">In basketball, a flagrant foul is a serious personal foul. It is considered flagrant if it involves too much or too violent contact that can injure another player. A flagrant foul may or may not be intentional. In the NCAA, if intentional, a flagrant foul is called an \"intentional foul\".\nThe NBA made a flagrant foul rule in the 1990s. It is intended to stop contact which puts a player's safety and health at risk. In the NBA, Flagrant 1 and Flagrant 2 are fouls. A player who commits a flagrant 2 foul must immediately leave the game.\nFlagrant fouls can also be punished with fines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":15},{"uri":"Personal_foul_(basketball)","surface_form":"personal foul","offset":56},{"uri":"NCAA","surface_form":"NCAA","offset":230},{"uri":"NBA","surface_form":"NBA","offset":305}]}
