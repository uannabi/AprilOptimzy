{"id":512541,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_Kingdom","text":"Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in the United Kingdom have improved a lot in recent years. In 2005, civil partnerships for same sex couples was legalised across the UK. In 2014, same sex marriage was legalised in England, Scotland and Wales. Gay people cannot get married in Northern Ireland because the Northern Ireland assembly voted against legalising it.\nSex between two men was illegal in the UK until 1967, but no law was ever made regarding lesbian sexual activity. In 1967, sex between men was partially decriminalized in England and Wales. It was made legal for men over 21 years' old in 1967, with some very serious restrictions, legal for men over 18 in 1994, and equalized with the heterosexual age of consent in 2002. The bill in 2000 also introduced a lesbian age of consent for the first time too. In Scotland it was legalised in 1981 and in Northern Ireland it was legalized in 1982. However, the UK Parliament legislated for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, which is expected to come into force on or before 13 January 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":40},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":60},{"uri":"Same_sex_marriage","surface_form":"same sex marriage","offset":199},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":234},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":243},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":256},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":296},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland_assembly","surface_form":"Northern Ireland assembly","offset":325}]}
