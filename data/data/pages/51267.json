{"id":51267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect","text":"The Doppler effect is a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave. It is caused by the change in distance between the thing creating the wave (causer) and whatever is measuring seeing or hearing the wave (watcher or observer).\nAnother word for \"causer\" is \"sender\" or \"source\". Another word for \"change in distance\" is \"speed\" or \"relative velocity\".\nA common example is sitting in a car while another car goes by the watcher. The watcher will hear a change in pitch, while the sender will not.\nFor waves read all the waves that can send out or reflected by an object. And for reflection read change of direction of a wave.\nEffects of changes in distance.\nIf observer and creator of the wave get closer, the frequency is higher and the wavelength is shorter.\nIf the distance between the observer and creator gets longer, the frequency is lower and the wavelength is longer.\nAn extreme example of the doppler effect is an aeroplane flying at a faster speed than the speed of sound and how the wall of sound is heard on the ground.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":34},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":48},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":64},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measuring","offset":170},{"uri":"Observe","surface_form":"observe","offset":219},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":387}]}
