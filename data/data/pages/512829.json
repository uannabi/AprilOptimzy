The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the species as lower risk. This species only lives naturally in the Columbia Basin of Washington State.\nThe last male purebred Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit died March 30, 2006, at the Oregon Zoo in Portland. The last purebred female died in 2008. A program by the Oregon Zoo, Washington State University and Northwest Trek is trying to preserve the genes by breeding surviving females with the Idaho pygmy rabbit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":49},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":64},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":91},{"uri":"Great_Basin","surface_form":"Great Basin","offset":111},{"uri":"Montana","surface_form":"Montana","offset":127},{"uri":"Leporid","surface_form":"leporid","offset":177},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":247},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":289},{"uri":"Weasels","surface_form":"Weasels","offset":457},{"uri":"Predation","surface_form":"predators","offset":478},{"uri":"Coyote","surface_form":"Coyote","offset":506},{"uri":"Red_Fox","surface_form":"red fox","offset":515},{"uri":"Badger","surface_form":"badger","offset":526},{"uri":"Bobcat","surface_form":"bobcat","offset":535},{"uri":"Owl","surface_form":"owl","offset":544},{"uri":"Hawk","surface_form":"hawk","offset":553},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunt","offset":564},{"uri":"Isolation","surface_form":"isolated","offset":608},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":617},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered species","offset":678},{"uri":"International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature","surface_form":"International Union for Conservation of Nature","offset":733},{"uri":"Washington_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Washington State","offset":872},{"uri":"Portland%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Portland","offset":983},{"uri":"Washington_State_University","surface_form":"Washington State University","offset":1061},{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":1134},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":1143}]}
