{"id":51290,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Cretaceous","text":"The Upper Cretaceous is the last geological epoch in the Cretaceous. It began 100.5 million years ago, and ended 66 million years ago.\nThe Cretaceous is traditionally divided into Lower Cretaceous (early), and Upper Cretaceous (late), because of the different rocks. The rocks reflect the conditions in which they were formed. From lowest to highest, it is subdivided into the Cenomanian, Turonian, Coniacian, Santonian, Campanian, and Maastrichtian ages.\nThe Upper Cretaceous is the time of chalk. Chalk is composed of countless millions of calcareous (CaCO3) plates called coccoliths. They are so small they can only just be seen with a light microscope; details require an electron microscope. The plates are formed by single-celled planktonic algae called coccolithophores, and were laid down in the off-shore seas.\nThe only other rock found in chalk is the flint, which is siliceous (silica, SiO2). This derives from those algae and animals which have skeletons of silica. Undoubtedly, this marks periods when the climate was somewhat different.\nThe Cretaceous was the last period when dinosaurs were the dominant land animals. \"Triceratops\", \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Velociraptor\" lived at this time. The huge \"Mosasaurus\" was the dominant marine predator. In the Cretaceous period, birds became more diverse. Flowering plants developed more, and became the dominant plants on land. The Upper Cretaceous ended with the T extinction event.\nExtinction events.\nThe end of the Cretaceous period is marked by the huge extinction event which marked the end of the dinosaurs. However, many groups had already disappeared long before then. There was an earlier extinction event in the Upper Cretaceous at the CenomanianTuronian boundary, about 95 to 90 million years ago. All we know about it is that there was huge volcanic activity which led to changes in sea life.\nThe event brought about the extinction of the pliosaurs, and most ichthyosaurs, and most lines of pterosaurs. Although the cause is uncertain, the result starved the Earth's oceans of oxygen for nearly half a million years. This caused the extinction of about 27 percent of marine invertebrates, including certain planktonic and benthic foraminifera, mollusks, bivalves, dinoflagellates and calcareous nannofossils. This global environmental disturbance increased atmospheric and oceanic temperatures. Boundary sediments show an enrichment of trace elements, and contain elevated \u03B413C values. \u03B413C varies in time as a function of biological productivity. This means the seas were no longer so favourable for life at that time, and many species went extinct.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geological","offset":33},{"uri":"Epoch_(geology)","surface_form":"epoch","offset":44},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":57},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":84},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":139},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":180},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rocks","offset":260},{"uri":"Chalk","surface_form":"chalk","offset":492},{"uri":"Calcium_carbonate","surface_form":"calcareous","offset":542},{"uri":"Coccolith","surface_form":"coccolith","offset":575},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscope","offset":645},{"uri":"Electron_microscope","surface_form":"electron microscope","offset":676},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":736},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":747},{"uri":"Coccolithophore","surface_form":"coccolithophore","offset":760},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":862},{"uri":"Silicon_dioxide","surface_form":"siliceous","offset":878},{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"silica","offset":889},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":1055},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":1091},{"uri":"Triceratops","surface_form":"Triceratops","offset":1134},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus","offset":1149},{"uri":"Velociraptor","surface_form":"Velociraptor","offset":1169},{"uri":"Mosasaurus","surface_form":"Mosasaurus","offset":1213},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":1242},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":1249},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1285},{"uri":"Diverse","surface_form":"diverse","offset":1303},{"uri":"Flowering_plants","surface_form":"Flowering plants","offset":1312},{"uri":"T_extinction_event","surface_form":"T extinction event","offset":1421},{"uri":"CenomanianTuronian_boundary","surface_form":"CenomanianTuronian boundary","offset":1703},{"uri":"Volcanic_activity","surface_form":"volcanic activity","offset":1810},{"uri":"Pliosaur","surface_form":"pliosaur","offset":1908},{"uri":"Ichthyosaur","surface_form":"ichthyosaur","offset":1928},{"uri":"Pterosaurs","surface_form":"pterosaurs","offset":1960},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"plankton","offset":2176},{"uri":"Benthic","surface_form":"benthic","offset":2191},{"uri":"Foraminifera","surface_form":"foraminifera","offset":2199},{"uri":"Mollusks","surface_form":"mollusks","offset":2213},{"uri":"Bivalves","surface_form":"bivalves","offset":2223},{"uri":"Dinoflagellate","surface_form":"dinoflagellate","offset":2233},{"uri":"%CE%B413C","surface_form":"\u03B413C","offset":2442}]}
