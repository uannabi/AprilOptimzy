{"id":51297,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropod","text":"Theropods ('beast foot') are a group of bipedal saurischian dinosaurs.\nAlthough they were primarily carnivorous, a number of theropod groups evolved herbivory, omnivory and insectivory.\nToday, they are represented by the 9,300 living species of birds, which evolved in the Upper Jurassic from small feathered coelurosaurian dinosaurs.\nAmong the features linking theropods to birds are bipedalism, the three-toed foot, a furcula (wishbone), air-filled bones, feathers and brooding of the eggs.\nProto-theropods.\nTheropods first appear in the earliest part of the Upper Triassic about 230 million years ago. They were the sole large terrestrial carnivores from the Lower Jurassic until the close of the Cretaceous, about 65 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bipedal","surface_form":"bipedal","offset":40},{"uri":"Saurischia","surface_form":"saurischia","offset":48},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":60},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":100},{"uri":"Herbivore","surface_form":"herbivory","offset":149},{"uri":"Omnivore","surface_form":"omnivory","offset":160},{"uri":"Insectivore","surface_form":"insectivory","offset":173},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":245},{"uri":"Upper_Jurassic","surface_form":"Upper Jurassic","offset":273},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":299},{"uri":"Coelurosaur","surface_form":"coelurosaur","offset":309},{"uri":"Bipedalism","surface_form":"bipedalism","offset":385},{"uri":"Furcula","surface_form":"furcula","offset":420},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":561},{"uri":"Lower_Jurassic","surface_form":"Lower Jurassic","offset":662},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":700}]}
