{"id":51299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwasawa_theory","text":"In number theory, Iwasawa theory is a Galois module theory of ideal class groups, started by Kenkichi Iwasawa, in the 1950s, as part of the theory of cyclotomic fields. In the early 1970s, Barry Mazur thought about generalizations of Iwasawa theory to Abelian Varieties. Later, in the early 90s, Ralph Greenberg has suggested an Iwasawa theory for motives.\nFormulation.\nThe first thing Iwasawa noticed was that there are towers of fields in algebraic number theory, having Galois group isomorphic with the additive group of p-adic integers. That group, usually written \u0393 in the theory and with multiplicative notation, can be found as a subgroup of Galois groups of infinite field extensions (which are by their nature pro-finite groups). The group formula_1 is the inverse limit of the additive groups formula_1, where \"p\" is the fixed prime number and formula_1. We can express this by Pontryagin duality in another way: \u0393 is dual to the discrete group of all formula_1-power roots of unity in the complex numbers.\nExample.\nwhere formula_1 is the field generated by a primitive formula_1-th root of unity. This tower of fields has a union formula_1. Then the Galois group of formula_1 over formula_1 is isomorphic with formula_1; because the Galois group of formula_1 over formula_1 is formula_1. In order to get an interesting Galois module here, Iwasawa took the ideal class group of formula_1, and let formula_1 be its formula_1-torsion part. There are norm mappings formula_1 when formula_1, and so an inverse system. Letting formula_1 be the inverse limit, we can say that formula_1 acts on formula_1, and it is good to have a description of this action.\nThe motivation here was undoubtedly that the formula_1-torsion in the ideal class group of formula_1 had already been identified by Kummer as the main obstacle to the direct proof of Fermat's last theorem. What Iwasawa did that was new, was to go 'off to infinity' in a new direction. In fact, formula_1 is a module over the group ring formula_1. This is a well-behaved ring (regular and two-dimensional), meaning that it is quite possible to classify modules over it, in a way that is not too coarse.\nHistory.\nFrom this beginning, in the 1950s, a good-sized theory has been built up. A basic connection was noticed between the module theory, and the p-adic L-functions that were defined in the 1960s by Kubota and Leopoldt. The latter begin from the Bernoulli numbers, and use interpolation to define p-adic analogues of the Dirichlet L-functions. It became clear that the theory might be able to move ahead finally from Kummer's century-old results on regular primes.\nThe main conjecture of Iwasawa theory was formulated as an assertion that two ways of defining p-adic L-functions (by module theory, by interpolation) should coincide, as far as that was well-defined. This was eventually proved by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles for Q, and for all totally real number fields by Andrew Wiles. These proofs were modeled upon Ken Ribet's proof of the converse to Herbrand's theorem (so-called Herbrand-Ribet theorem).\nMore recently, also modeled upon Ribet's method, Chris Skinner and Eric Urban have announced a proof of a \"main conjecture\" for GL(2). An easier proof of the Mazur-Wiles theorem can be found by using Euler systems as developed by Kolyvagin (see Washington's book). Other generalizations of the main conjecture proved using the Euler system method have been found by Karl Rubin, amongst others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":3},{"uri":"Galois_module","surface_form":"Galois module","offset":38},{"uri":"Ideal_class_group","surface_form":"ideal class group","offset":62},{"uri":"Kenkichi_Iwasawa","surface_form":"Kenkichi Iwasawa","offset":93},{"uri":"Cyclotomic_field","surface_form":"cyclotomic field","offset":150},{"uri":"Barry_Mazur","surface_form":"Barry Mazur","offset":189},{"uri":"Ralph_Greenberg","surface_form":"Ralph Greenberg","offset":296},{"uri":"Motive_(algebraic_geometry)","surface_form":"motives","offset":348},{"uri":"Algebraic_number_theory","surface_form":"algebraic number theory","offset":441},{"uri":"Galois_group","surface_form":"Galois group","offset":473},{"uri":"P-adic_integer","surface_form":"p-adic integer","offset":524},{"uri":"Pro-finite_group","surface_form":"pro-finite group","offset":719},{"uri":"Inverse_limit","surface_form":"inverse limit","offset":766},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":837},{"uri":"Pontryagin_duality","surface_form":"Pontryagin duality","offset":888},{"uri":"Roots_of_unity","surface_form":"roots of unity","offset":978},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":1000},{"uri":"Field_norm","surface_form":"norm","offset":1458},{"uri":"Inverse_limit","surface_form":"inverse limit","offset":1549},{"uri":"Kummer","surface_form":"Kummer","offset":1794},{"uri":"Fermat%27s_last_theorem","surface_form":"Fermat's last theorem","offset":1845},{"uri":"Module_(mathematics)","surface_form":"module","offset":1971},{"uri":"Group_ring","surface_form":"group ring","offset":1987},{"uri":"Regular_local_ring","surface_form":"regular","offset":2038},{"uri":"P-adic_L-function","surface_form":"p-adic L-function","offset":2313},{"uri":"Bernoulli_number","surface_form":"Bernoulli number","offset":2413},{"uri":"Interpolation","surface_form":"interpolation","offset":2440},{"uri":"Dirichlet_L-function","surface_form":"Dirichlet L-function","offset":2488},{"uri":"Regular_prime","surface_form":"regular prime","offset":2616},{"uri":"Barry_Mazur","surface_form":"Barry Mazur","offset":2863},{"uri":"Andrew_Wiles","surface_form":"Andrew Wiles","offset":2879},{"uri":"Totally_real_number_field","surface_form":"totally real number field","offset":2911},{"uri":"Ken_Ribet","surface_form":"Ken Ribet","offset":2986},{"uri":"Herbrand-Ribet_theorem","surface_form":"Herbrand-Ribet theorem","offset":3053},{"uri":"Euler_system","surface_form":"Euler system","offset":3278},{"uri":"Kolyvagin","surface_form":"Kolyvagin","offset":3308},{"uri":"Karl_Rubin","surface_form":"Karl Rubin","offset":3444}]}
