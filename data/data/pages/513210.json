{"id":513210,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Vermont","text":"The Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont is the head of the government of the state. The governor is elected in even-numbered years by direct voting for a term of two years. Vermont along with New Hampshire are now the only states to hold gubernatorial elections every two years, instead of every four as in the other 48 states.\nThere is no limit on the number of terms a governor can serve. If no candidate receives at least 50 percent plus one vote of all votes for governor cast in the election, the governor is then elected by the state legislature.\nThe incumbent governor is Phillip Scott.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":20},{"uri":"Government_of_Vermont","surface_form":"government of the state","offset":61},{"uri":"Term_of_office","surface_form":"term","offset":156},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":194},{"uri":"Vermont_General_Assembly","surface_form":"state legislature","offset":536},{"uri":"Phillip_Scott","surface_form":"Phillip Scott","offset":581}]}
