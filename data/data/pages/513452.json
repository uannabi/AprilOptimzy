It tracks airplay from radio stations in the United States. The chart was started on August 16, 2003 (as a unpublished chart). It became official the week of October 25, 2003. At first it had six stations who programed a full-time Dance format. This is when it made its playlist available for viewing on BDS Radio's website. This included the selected Top 40, Rhythmic, and Adult Top 40 stations who submit their mix show hours to Billboard. A modified version was added to Billboard's website in January 2013. It featured 15 songs. Originally featuring 25 charted titles when it started in 2003, it was expanded finally to 40 songs in December 2014. It is available from Billboard and from BDS.\nThe first number one single on this chart was \"Never (Past Tense)\". It was by The Roc Project featuring Tina Arena for the week ending August 16, 2003. When Billboard made the chart official the week ending October 25, 2003, \"Just The Way You Are\" by Milky was the first number-one single in the published chart.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Record_chart","surface_form":"chart","offset":69},{"uri":"Monitor","surface_form":"monitor","offset":80},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard Magazine","offset":99},{"uri":"Airplay","surface_form":"airplay","offset":129},{"uri":"Radio_station","surface_form":"radio station","offset":142},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":164},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":256},{"uri":"Radio_program","surface_form":"programed","offset":328},{"uri":"Format","surface_form":"format","offset":356},{"uri":"Playlist","surface_form":"playlist","offset":389},{"uri":"Nielsen_Broadcast_Data_Systems","surface_form":"BDS Radio's website","offset":423},{"uri":"Top_40","surface_form":"Top 40","offset":471},{"uri":"Rhythmic_Songs_Chart","surface_form":"Rhythmic","offset":479},{"uri":"Adult_Top_40","surface_form":"Adult Top 40","offset":493},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":645},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":836},{"uri":"Tina_Arena","surface_form":"Tina Arena","offset":919},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"published","offset":1111}]}
