{"id":513469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Evans","text":"Daniel Jackson Evans (born October 16, 1925) is an American politician. He served three terms as the 16th Governor of the state of Washington from 1965 to 1977. He represented the state in the United States Senate from 1983 to 1989.\nEarly life.\nEvans was born in Seattle, Washington. He served in the United States Navy during the later years of World War II. Evans studied at the University of Washington. He originally studied to be a structural engineer.\nGovernor of Washington (1965-1977).\nEvans served as governor from 1965 until 1977, still the only governor to serve three four-year consecutive terms and the second to be elected to three terms following Arthur B. Langlie in Washington state history. A 1981 University of Michigan study named him one of the ten outstanding American governors of the 20th century. He declined to run for a fourth term.\nSerial killer Ted Bundy served as a campaign aide for Evans and maintained a close relationship with the Governor. During the 1972 campaign, Bundy followed Evans' Democratic opponent around the state, tape recording his speeches and reported back to Evans personally.\nUnited States senator (1983-1989).\nIn 1983, Governor John Spellman appointed Evans to the United States Senate to fill a seat left vacant by the death of longtime senator Henry M. \"Scoop\" Jackson. Evans won a special election later that year against Mike Lowry and filled the remainder of Jackson's unexpired term, retiring from politics after the 1988 elections. He was not happy as a U.S. Senator; he wrote an April 1988 piece in \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"Why I'm Quitting the Senate\", in which he complained of \"bickering and protracted paralysis\".\nFailed vice presidential bids.\nEvans was seriously considered for the Republican vice presidential nomination on the ticket with Gerald Ford in 1976 (but lost out to Bob Dole). Richard Nixon in 1968 had also hinted at a possible Evans nomination for the vice presidency.\nAt the 1968 Republican National Convention (where he gave the keynote address) Evans refused to endorse Nixon for the presidential nomination, remaining a supporter of the unsuccessful candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.\nPersonal life.\nEvans married Nancy Bell in 1959. Together, they have three children. He lives in Seattle as of 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"List_of_Washington_Governors","surface_form":"16th Governor","offset":101},{"uri":"Washington_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":131},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senate","offset":193},{"uri":"Seattle%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Seattle, Washington","offset":263},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":301},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":346},{"uri":"University_of_Washington","surface_form":"University of Washington","offset":381},{"uri":"Structural_engineer","surface_form":"structural engineer","offset":437},{"uri":"Arthur_B._Langlie","surface_form":"Arthur B.
