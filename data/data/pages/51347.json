{"id":51347,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre","text":"The Nanjing Massacre was a massacre (an unjust killing of many people) that happened in Nanjing, China, in December of 1937 and January of 1938. It was part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which was the part of World War II between China and Japan. At the time, Japan was trying to take over China and Nanjing was the Chinese capital. The Japanese Army reached Nanjing on 13 December 1937 and began killing thousands upon thousands of men and boys and raping thousands upon thousands of women and girls.\nSome Japanese claim the fighting in Nanjing was the same or not much worse than fighting in other places and in other wars. That is simply untrue. There is a lot of evidence from the Chinese, from outsiders who were there, from outsiders who have studied it, and from the Japanese themselves that things were much worse. There were many, many war crimes: soldiers without weapons were killed; people who were not soldiers were killed; many were tortured (hurt very badly), mutilated (hurt ways that can never be fixed), or killed in very cruel ways; many were raped (forced to have sex) or forced to work and treated like things. We have the orders from the soldier's leaders telling them to do these kinds of things and not to follow rules against them. The Nanjing Massacre was so bad that some even think of it as a kind of genocide (trying to wipe out an entire group of people).\nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre\u2014and anger at attempts to deny that it happened or to honor the soldiers who led it at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo\u2014still cause difficulty between the Chinese and Japanese governments and between Chinese and Japanese people.\nNames.\nThe Nanjing Massacre is also known as the. It was known at the time as the or the. The name of Nanjing has not changed: it was then and now, but people have changed the way they spell the sounds of Chinese names using the Latin alphabet. \"Nanking\" was the Postal Map spelling, which usually tried to spell words the way local people said them around the year 1900. \"Nanjing\" is the pinyin spelling, which spells words the way they should sound in Mandarin Chinese.\nThe Mandarin Chinese name for the Nanjing Massacre is the \"N\u00E1nj\u012Bng D\u00E0t\u00FAsh\u0101\", which means the same thing. (Part-by-part, \"d\u00E0t\u00FAsh\u0101\" could mean \"a big butchering and killing\" but, taken all together, it is just the Chinese word for \"massacre\".) It is written in traditional Chinese writing and in the easier Chinese writing now used by mainland China and Singapore.\nThe Japanese can use similar names but often prefer to call it the \"Nankin Jiken\", which just means \"The Thing that Happened in Nanjing\". It is written in Japanese writing.\nMass murder of civilians.\nDuring the six weeks of the Nanjing massacre, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) massacred between 40,000 and 300,000 people. It is difficult to know exactly how many people were killed in this mass murder, because the IJA burnt many bodies, buried others in mass graves, and dumped others in the Yangtze River. Because of this, scholars and historians do not agree on exactly how many civilians were killed.p.\u00A01015\nHowever, historians agree that the Imperial Japanese Army began massacring Chinese civilians the day they entered Nanjing. On that day, John Rabe, a German businessman, wrote in his diary: \"We come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had... been [running away] and were shot from behind.\"p.\u00A067\nIn another massacre, Japanese soldiers shot thousands of Chinese people with machine guns. They left their bodies in a trench they named the \"Ten-Thousand-Corpse Ditch.\" Most historians think that more than 12,000 people were killed in this massacre. The IJA also massacred about 100 Hui people (a minority group in China who are mostly Muslim).\nTorture of civilians.\nFor the entire six weeks of the Massacre, the Imperial Japanese Army kept killing Chinese civilians. They killed in cruel, brutal ways and often tortured their victims before killing them.\nRape.\nDuring the Massacre, the Japanese soldiers raped about 20,000 women including children and the elderly.p.\u00A01012 Soldiers would go from door to door, searching for girls. When they found one, they would take her and rape her as a group. If anyone tried to stop the soldiers, the soldiers would shoot them.p.\u00A077\nRight after they raped the women, the Japanese soldiers would often kill them, sometimes by mutilating their sex organs.\nOne survivor of the massacre said that sons were forced to rape their mothers, and fathers were forced to rape their daughters. One group of soldiers gang-raped a pregnant woman, who gave birth only a few hours later (the baby did not seem to be hurt). Japanese soldiers also raped Buddhist nuns and forced monks to rape women.\nKilling of prisoners of war.\nStarting in 1931, an international law called the Third Geneva Convention said it was illegal to treat prisoners of war in certain ways. It said these prisoners had rights for example, the right to have a trial before being executed. However, in August 1937, Hirohito, the Emperor of Japan, had decided that neither he nor the army would not follow any international laws about how Chinese prisoners of war had to be treated.\nRight after the IJA took over Nanjing, they started searching for ex-Chinese soldiers. They took thousands of young men as prisoners. Some of these men were never soldiers; the IJA just assumed they were. Without any trials, the IJA took many of these young men to the Yangtze River and killed them with machine guns.\nAccording to confessions made by former IJA soldiers, on December 13 and 14, 1937, a unit of IJA soldiers had taken 14,777 Chinese prisoners of war. In the next few days, they took another 2,0003,000 prisoners. In two days, the IJA massacred every one of these prisoners of warover 15,000 people. In their confessions, the former IJA soldiers said their military leaders had ordered them to do this.\nOver the six weeks of the massacre, the IJA killed a total of about 30,000 Chinese prisoners of war.p.\u00A01015\nTheft and arson.\nThe Japanese Army left most of the buildings in Nanjing destroyed by looting and arson. They destroyed newly built government buildings as well as many civilians' homes. Soldiers also stole whatever they wanted. Because the Imperial Japanese Army was so much stronger than the Chinese soldiers and civilians in Nanjing, the Chinese could not fight back. This meant the Japanese could take all of the city's valuable things for themselves.\nEnd of the massacre.\nIn January 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army announced that Nanjing was in \"order\" again. In the first week of February, it created a government that would obey all of Japan's needs. After that, the IJA left. The massacre was over.\nTrial and punishment.\nOn September 2, 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers. This ended World War II.\nSoon after this, the Allied Powers began creating international military courts. To try Japan's leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity, they created the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE).\nInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East.\nAll three of these men were found guilty of \"Class A\" war crimes. This meant they had been found guilty of planning and being in charge of the war. All three were sentenced to death and were executed.\nThe Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.\nIn 1946, the Chinese government created the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal. This court tried General Matsui's lieutenant, Tani Hisao, for his part in the Nanjing Massacre. It found him guilty and sentenced him to death.\nDenial.\nThe Nanjing Massacre is still very controversial in Japan. Only a small number of Japanese writers say the Massacre never happened at all. Most of the argument over the massacre has to do with how many Chinese people died. Some scholars say that many fewer Chinese people died than most historians say. For example, Japanese writer Tanaka Masaaki says that only a few hundred civilians died in Nanjing.\nAs of 2014, Japan still honored fourteen \"Class A\" war criminalsincluding the three who were in charge of the Nanjing Massacreat a national shrine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Massacre","surface_form":"massacre","offset":27},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"unjust","offset":40},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"killing","offset":47},{"uri":"Nanjing","surface_form":"Nanjing","offset":88},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":97},{"uri":"December","surface_form":"December","offset":107},{"uri":"1937","surface_form":"1937","offset":119},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":128},{"uri":"1938","surface_form":"1938","offset":139},{"uri":"Second_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"Second
