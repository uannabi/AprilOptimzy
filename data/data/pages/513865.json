{"id":513865,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mis-Teeq","text":"Mis-Teeq were an English R&B and UK garage girl group. The members were lead singer Sabrina Washington, rapper Alesha Dixon and backing vocalist Su-Elise Nash. A fourth member, Zena McNally, performed on only one song, \"Why\" (the group's first song). She left soon after to start a solo career.\nThe group only released two studio albums, \"Lickin' on Both Sides\" and \"Eye Candy\". They released a self titled album in the United States in 2004. That album had songs from the group's first two albums. There was also a greatest hits album released in 2005. The group broke up in 2005 after their label went out of business. All of the group's singles reached the UK top 40.\nEver since the group broke up in 2005, there have been rumors about the group releasing more music. On 9 February 2011, it was reported that the group were in talks to do a comeback tour. This was denied by Dixon. Two years later, Dixon said that she would never rule out a reunion..","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":17},{"uri":"Contemporary_R%26amp%3BB","surface_form":"R&B","offset":25},{"uri":"UK_garage","surface_form":"UK garage","offset":33},{"uri":"Sabrina_Washington","surface_form":"Sabrina Washington","offset":84},{"uri":"Alesha_Dixon","surface_form":"Alesha Dixon","offset":111},{"uri":"Su-Elise_Nash","surface_form":"Su-Elise Nash","offset":145},{"uri":"Lickin%27_on_Both_Sides","surface_form":"Lickin' on Both Sides","offset":339},{"uri":"Eye_Candy_(album)","surface_form":"Eye Candy","offset":367},{"uri":"Mis-Teeq_(album)","surface_form":"self titled","offset":395},{"uri":"Greatest_Hits_(Mis-Teeq_album)","surface_form":"greatest hits","offset":516}]}
