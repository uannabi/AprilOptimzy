Some of its articles were written by the best-known scholars of the time. The articles are still of value and interest to modern scholars as examples for the knowledge of the 19th and early 20th centuries. They contain, however, a number of problematic areas for the modern scholar using them as a source. The eleventh edition is no longer restricted by copyright and is available online, both in its original text and in part in other online encyclopaedias and works.\nBackground.\nThe 1911 eleventh edition was assembled under the leadership of American publisher Horace Everett Hooper, and edited by Hugh Chisholm. American marketing methods assisted sales. Some 11% of the contributors were American, and a New York office was established to run that side of the enterprise.\nSome articles were written by the best-known scholars of the day, such as Edmund Gosse, J. B. Bury, Algernon Charles Swinburne, John Muir, Prince Peter Kropotkin, T. H. Huxley, G. K. Chesterton, Edmund Husserl and William Michael Rossetti, and others well known to that era.\nThe eleventh edition has become a commonly quoted source because of the reputation of the \"Britannica\" at that time and because it is now in the public domain and has been made available on the Internet. The \"Encyclop\u00E6dia Britannica\" of 1911 has been used as a source for many modern projects, such as Wikipedia and the \"Gutenberg Encyclopedia\".\n\"Gutenberg Encyclopedia\".\nThe \"Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia\" is actually the eleventh edition of the \"Encyclop\u00E6dia Britannica\", renamed to address Britannica's trademark concerns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["book"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Edition_(book)","surface_form":"editions","offset":85},{"uri":"Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","surface_form":"Encyclop\u00E6dia Britannica","offset":102},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":180},{"uri":"Problematic","surface_form":"problematic","offset":369},{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":482},{"uri":"Online","surface_form":"online","offset":509},{"uri":"Assembled","surface_form":"assembled","offset":639},{"uri":"Horace_Everett_Hooper","surface_form":"Horace Everett Hooper","offset":692},{"uri":"Hugh_Chisholm","surface_form":"Hugh Chisholm","offset":729},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":837},{"uri":"Edmund_Gosse","surface_form":"Edmund Gosse","offset":979},{"uri":"J._B._Bury","surface_form":"J.
