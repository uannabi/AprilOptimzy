In 1993 versions of some episodes, at the end of some scenes of some episodes and some episodes, the 1993 Fraggle Rock \"Stay tuned\" screen/logo plastered/replaced the 1982\u20131987 Fraggle Rock ending credits and at the end of 1993 versions of some episodes, 1993 Fraggle Rock ending credits replace/plastered 1982\u20131987 Fraggle Rock ending credits. The intro was shortened on The Hub in 2010\u20132013, and Hub Network in 2013\u20132014 and Discovery Family since 2014. In the cartoonish/animated intro, the Roland D-50 patch \"Piano-Fifty\" was heard. In some versions of the theme, the Yamaha DX7 internal factory patch \"Electric Bass 1\" was heard in 1983\u20131987. It got cartoonish/animated in season 6 (1987).\n\"Fraggle Rock\" was co-produced by British television company Television South (TVS), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, U.S. pay television service Home Box Office and Henson Associates. Unlike \"Sesame Street\", it was intended from the start to be an international production. Henson described the \"Fraggle Rock\" series as \"a high-energy, raucous musical romp. It's a lot of silliness. It's wonderful.\" While the program proved accessible to audiences of all ages, it used the fantasy creatures as examples to deal with serious issues. These included prejudice, spirituality, personal identity, the environment, and social conflict.\n\"Fraggle Rock\" features many original songs.\nThe Workshop/Lighthouse.\nThe Fraggles call the human world \"outer space\" and humans \"silly creatures from outer space.\"\nDoozers.\nDoozers are people smaller than Fraggles. Doozers have green skin and small eyes. They almost always wear hard hats. They spend most of their time building clear structures using cranes and other construction tools. The Fraggles like to eat these structures.\nGorgs.\nGorgs are people much bigger than Fraggles. They call their house \"the castle\" and the rest of their land \"the universe.\" The show never says whether they really are rulers or whether they are poor farmers who like to pretend they are rulers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":33},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":41},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":50},{"uri":"Live_action","surface_form":"live action","offset":70},{"uri":"Puppet","surface_form":"puppet","offset":82},{"uri":"Television_series","surface_form":"television series","offset":89},{"uri":"Jim_Henson","surface_form":"Jim Henson","offset":126},{"uri":"The_Muppets","surface_form":"Muppet","offset":173},{"uri":"The_Hub","surface_form":"The Hub","offset":683},{"uri":"Hub_Network","surface_form":"Hub Network","offset":709},{"uri":"Discovery_Family","surface_form":"Discovery Family","offset":738},{"uri":"Roland_D-50","surface_form":"Roland D-50","offset":805},{"uri":"Yamaha_DX7","surface_form":"Yamaha DX7","offset":883},{"uri":"Produced","surface_form":"produced","offset":1028},{"uri":"Television_South","surface_form":"Television South","offset":1067},{"uri":"Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation","surface_form":"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation","offset":1095},{"uri":"U.S.","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":1130},{"uri":"Pay_television","surface_form":"pay television","offset":1135},{"uri":"HBO","surface_form":"Home Box Office","offset":1158},{"uri":"Sesame_Street","surface_form":"Sesame Street","offset":1205},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":1261},{"uri":"Raucous","surface_form":"raucous","offset":1349},{"uri":"Romp","surface_form":"romp","offset":1365},{"uri":"Silly","surface_form":"silliness","offset":1385},{"uri":"Fantasy","surface_form":"fantasy","offset":1487},{"uri":"Creatures","surface_form":"creatures","offset":1495},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":1508},{"uri":"Prejudice","surface_form":"prejudice","offset":1561},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spirituality","offset":1572},{"uri":"Identity","surface_form":"personal identity","offset":1586},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":1609},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":1626},{"uri":"Conflict","surface_form":"conflict","offset":1633},{"uri":"Hard_hat","surface_form":"hard hat","offset":1923}]}
