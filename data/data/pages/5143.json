{"id":5143,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Rose","text":"The \"Mary Rose\" was a ship which belonged to Henry VIII of England. She sank in 1545 in battle with a French fleet.\nIn 1979, the \"Mary Rose\" Trust was formed. In 1982 the \"Mary Rose\" Trust managed to get the \"Mary Rose\" out of the sea. In 1994, they started to preserve her.\nThe remains of the \"Mary Rose\" are currently in Portsmouth, England with the HMS \"Victory\" and HMS \"Warrior\".\nSinking.\nIt is not known the exact reason for the sinking. One of the theories is that she had the gun ports open to fire at the French. She then turned to fire at the other side, but the men on board failed to close the gun ports. Sea water got in the open gun ports, which tipped her over and she sank.\nThe \"Mary Rose\" sank because the wind blew and tipped her over.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Henry_VIII_of_England","surface_form":"Henry VIII of England","offset":45},{"uri":"1545","surface_form":"1545","offset":80},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":102},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":119},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":162},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":239},{"uri":"Portsmouth","surface_form":"Portsmouth","offset":323},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":335},{"uri":"HMS_Victory","surface_form":"HMS \"Victory\"","offset":352},{"uri":"HMS_Warrior_(1860)","surface_form":"HMS \"Warrior\"","offset":370},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":502},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":514}]}
