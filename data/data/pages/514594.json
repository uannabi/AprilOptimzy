{"id":514594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee","text":"A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee that is a member of the genus \"Apis\". They produce and store honey and make perennial, colonial nests from wax. They are in contrast with the stingless honey bee.\nHoney bees are the only living members of the tribe Apini, all in the genus \"Apis\". There are only seven species of honey bee, with a total of 44 subspecies. Historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized.\nHoney bees are only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, but only members of the genus \"Apis\" are true honey bees. The study of honey bees is known as 'melittology'.\nThe first \"Apis\" bees appear in the fossil record at the Eocene\u2013Oligocene boundary (34 million years ago (mya)), in European deposits. This shows that the bees were present in Europe by that time. Few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin.\nNo \"Apis\" species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of \"A. mellifera\" by Europeans. Only one fossil species is known, a single 14-million-year-old specimen from Nevada.\nThe close relatives of modern honey bees\u00A0\u2013 bumblebees and stingless bees\u00A0\u2013 are also social to some degree,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bee","offset":33},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":61},{"uri":"Honey","surface_form":"honey","offset":98},{"uri":"Perennial","surface_form":"perennial","offset":113},{"uri":"Colony_(biology)","surface_form":"colonial","offset":124},{"uri":"Beeswax","surface_form":"wax","offset":144},{"uri":"Stingless_bee","surface_form":"stingless honey bee","offset":179},{"uri":"Tribe_(biology)","surface_form":"tribe","offset":246},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":305},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":346},{"uri":"Fossil_record","surface_form":"fossil record","offset":706},{"uri":"Eocene","surface_form":"Eocene","offset":727},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":734},{"uri":"New_World","surface_form":"New World","offset":989},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":1151},{"uri":"Bumblebee","surface_form":"bumblebee","offset":1202},{"uri":"Stingless_bee","surface_form":"stingless bee","offset":1217}]}
