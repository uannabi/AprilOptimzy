{"id":514603,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev_tortoise","text":"The Negev tortoise (\"Testudo werneri\") is a tortoise found mainly in the Negev desert in southern Israel. It was once present in the Sinai Peninsula. In Israel it is protected by law and there are conservation programs. It is currently considered a critically endangered species.\nThe Negev is one of the world's smallest tortoises. Unlike other tortoises it does not hibernate in winter. Instead, winter is the breeding season. In 2010 the IUCN recommended that Israel take additional steps to protect the Negev tortoise including creating a wildlife preserve.\nThere is some disagreement over whether the Negev tortoise is the same species as the Kleinmann's tortoise.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tortoise","surface_form":"tortoise","offset":44},{"uri":"Negev","surface_form":"Negev","offset":73},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":89},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":98},{"uri":"Sinai_Peninsula","surface_form":"Sinai Peninsula","offset":133},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":179},{"uri":"Critically_endangered_species","surface_form":"critically endangered species","offset":249},{"uri":"Hibernate","surface_form":"hibernate","offset":367},{"uri":"IUCN","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":440},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":462},{"uri":"Wildlife_preserve","surface_form":"wildlife preserve","offset":542},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":632},{"uri":"Kleinmann%27s_tortoise","surface_form":"Kleinmann's tortoise","offset":647}]}
