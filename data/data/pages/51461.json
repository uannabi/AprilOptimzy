{"id":51461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish","text":"Shellfish is a culinary term for some aquatic invertebrates used as food: molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. It is not a scientific term, and its use may vary from place to place.\nBoth saltwater and freshwater invertebrates are considered shellfish. Molluscs commonly used as food include the clam, mussel, oyster, winkle, and scallop.\nSome crustaceans commonly eaten are the shrimp, prawn, lobster, crayfish, and crab.\nEchinoderms are not eaten as commonly as molluscs and crustaceans. In Asia, sea cucumber and sea urchins are eaten.\nEdible cephalopods such as squid, octopus, and cuttlefish and terrestrial snails, though all molluscs, are sometimes considered to be shellfish and sometimes not.\nThe term \"finfish\" is sometimes used to distinguish ordinary (vertebrate) fish from shellfish.\nJewish and Islamic dietary laws forbid the eating of shellfish (those that live on the land, and in the water).\nIn Japanese cuisine, chefs often use shellfish and their roe. Sushi and sashimi feature both raw and cooked shellfish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Invertebrate","surface_form":"invertebrate","offset":46},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":68},{"uri":"Mollusc","surface_form":"mollusc","offset":74},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":84},{"uri":"Echinoderm","surface_form":"echinoderm","offset":101},{"uri":"Clam","surface_form":"clam","offset":298},{"uri":"Mussel","surface_form":"mussel","offset":304},{"uri":"Oyster","surface_form":"oyster","offset":312},{"uri":"Periwinkle_(mollusc)","surface_form":"winkle","offset":320},{"uri":"Scallop","surface_form":"scallop","offset":332},{"uri":"Shrimp","surface_form":"shrimp","offset":381},{"uri":"Prawn","surface_form":"prawn","offset":389},{"uri":"Lobster","surface_form":"lobster","offset":396},{"uri":"Crayfish","surface_form":"crayfish","offset":405},{"uri":"Crab","surface_form":"crab","offset":419},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":495},{"uri":"Sea_cucumber","surface_form":"sea cucumber","offset":501},{"uri":"Sea_urchin","surface_form":"sea urchin","offset":518},{"uri":"Cephalopod","surface_form":"cephalopod","offset":548},{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":568},{"uri":"Octopus","surface_form":"octopus","offset":575},{"uri":"Cuttlefish","surface_form":"cuttlefish","offset":588},{"uri":"Snail","surface_form":"snail","offset":615},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":778},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":799},{"uri":"Halal","surface_form":"Islamic","offset":810},{"uri":"Japanese_cuisine","surface_form":"Japanese cuisine","offset":914},{"uri":"Roe","surface_form":"roe","offset":968},{"uri":"Sushi","surface_form":"Sushi","offset":973},{"uri":"Sashimi","surface_form":"sashimi","offset":983}]}
