{"id":514634,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine","text":"Alanine (abbreviated as Ala or A) is an \u03B1-amino acid. It has the chemical formula CH3CH(NH2)COOH.\nThe L-isomer is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the genetic code. Its codons are GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG. It is classified as a non-polar amino acid.\nL-Alanine accounts for 7.8% of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins. Leucine is the only amino acid which is more common.\nD-Alanine occurs in bacterial cell walls and in some peptide antibiotics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":42},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":65},{"uri":"Isomer","surface_form":"isomer","offset":104},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":128},{"uri":"Genetic_code","surface_form":"genetic code","offset":155},{"uri":"Non-polar","surface_form":"non-polar","offset":230},{"uri":"Primary_structure","surface_form":"primary structure","offset":287},{"uri":"Proteins","surface_form":"proteins","offset":326},{"uri":"Leucine","surface_form":"Leucine","offset":336},{"uri":"Bacterial","surface_form":"bacterial","offset":409},{"uri":"Cell_wall","surface_form":"cell wall","offset":419},{"uri":"Peptide","surface_form":"peptide","offset":442},{"uri":"Antibiotics","surface_form":"antibiotics","offset":450}]}
