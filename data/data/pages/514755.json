{"id":514755,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillwater%2C_Minnesota","text":"Stillwater is a city in Washington County, Minnesota. It is on the St. Croix River directly across from the state of Wisconsin. The population was 18,225 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat. Stillwater is part of the Twin Cities Metro Area.\nTreaties.\nOn July 29 and September 29, 1837, treaties were signed between the US government and the local Ojibwa and Dakota nations. They allowed settlement in the St. Croix River Valley. The town was founded by settlers drawn by the area's then-abundant lumber and river traffic. It is one of Minnesota's oldest towns, preceding Minneapolis by several years. Stillwater was officially incorporated as a city on March 4, 1854 (the same day as St. Paul). The city was named for the calm waters of the St. Croix River.\nTerritorial convention.\nStillwater is often called the birthplace of Minnesota. In 1848, a territorial convention that began the process of establishing Minnesota as a state was held in Stillwater. The convention selected three leading Minnesota cities as locations for three important public institutions. Minneapolis got the University of Minnesota, Saint Paul became the capital, and Stillwater was chosen as the site of the territory's first prison. The Minnesota Territorial Prison was opened in 1853.\nLumbering era.\nLumbering was the main industry in the St. Croix River Valley in the second half of the nineteenth century. For many years logs were sent down the St. Croix river, collected at the St. Croix Boom Site two miles upstream of Stillwater, and processed in Stillwater's many sawmills. Steamboats were used most widely from 1860 to 1890, and a few are still used for entertainment today.\nCivil war.\nStillwater sent men of the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Company B and the 8th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment Company C to fight during the American Civil War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Washington_County%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Washington County","offset":24},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":43},{"uri":"St._Croix_River_(Wisconsin-Minnesota)","surface_form":"St. Croix River","offset":67},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":117},{"uri":"2010_United_States_Census","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":161},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":184},{"uri":"Minneapolis-Saint_Paul","surface_form":"Twin Cities Metro Area","offset":223},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaties","offset":292},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"US government","offset":325},{"uri":"Ojibwa","surface_form":"Ojibwa","offset":353},{"uri":"Sioux","surface_form":"Dakota","offset":364},{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":393},{"uri":"St._Croix_River_(Wisconsin-Minnesota)","surface_form":"St. Croix River Valley","offset":411},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":439},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"found","offset":448},{"uri":"Lumber","surface_form":"lumber","offset":502},{"uri":"Minneapolis","surface_form":"Minneapolis","offset":577},{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"incorporated","offset":633},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":651},{"uri":"St._Paul%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"St. Paul","offset":690},{"uri":"Birthplace","surface_form":"birthplace","offset":819},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territorial","offset":855},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"convention","offset":867},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":1010},{"uri":"University_of_Minnesota","surface_form":"University of Minnesota","offset":1091},{"uri":"St._Paul%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Saint Paul","offset":1116},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":1138},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":1210},{"uri":"Minnesota_Territorial_Prison","surface_form":"Minnesota Territorial Prison","offset":1222},{"uri":"Lumbering","surface_form":"Lumbering","offset":1286},{"uri":"Nineteenth_century","surface_form":"nineteenth century","offset":1374},{"uri":"St._Croix_Boom_Site","surface_form":"St. Croix Boom Site","offset":1467},{"uri":"Sawmill","surface_form":"sawmill","offset":1556},{"uri":"Steamboat","surface_form":"Steamboat","offset":1566},{"uri":"1st_Minnesota_Volunteer_Infantry","surface_form":"1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry","offset":1706},{"uri":"8th_Minnesota_Volunteer_Infantry_Regiment","surface_form":"8th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment","offset":1757},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":1829}]}
