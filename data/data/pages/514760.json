The garden is dedicated to the plants of Israel.\nThe botanic garden was opened in 1931 by Otto Warburg and Alexander Eig. They were the founders of the botanic department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. After Mount Scopus was isolated from Israel in 1948, they decided to create a new botanical garden in West Jerusalem, in Givat Ram. The new garden, Jerusalem Botanical Gardens, was opened in 1954.\nThe National Botanic Garden of Israel is also an archaeological park. It has many Jewish burial caves from the Second Temple period. In the southern part of the garden there is a famous cave called the Tomb of Nicanor. The cave is also burial place of two Zionist activists: Leon Pinsker and Menachem Ussishkin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botanic_garden","surface_form":"botanic garden","offset":143},{"uri":"Mount_Scopus","surface_form":"Mount Scopus","offset":169},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":185},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":237},{"uri":"Otto_Warburg","surface_form":"Otto Warburg","offset":286},{"uri":"Alexander_Eig","surface_form":"Alexander Eig","offset":303},{"uri":"Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem","surface_form":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem","offset":374},{"uri":"Givat_Ram","surface_form":"Givat Ram","offset":527},{"uri":"Jerusalem_Botanical_Gardens","surface_form":"Jerusalem Botanical Gardens","offset":554},{"uri":"Archaeological_park","surface_form":"archaeological park","offset":652},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":685},{"uri":"Second_Temple","surface_form":"Second Temple","offset":714},{"uri":"Tomb_of_Nicanor","surface_form":"Tomb of Nicanor","offset":805},{"uri":"Zionism","surface_form":"Zionist","offset":859},{"uri":"Leon_Pinsker","surface_form":"Leon Pinsker","offset":878},{"uri":"Menachem_Ussishkin","surface_form":"Menachem Ussishkin","offset":895}]}
