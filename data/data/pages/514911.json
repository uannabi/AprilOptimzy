{"id":514911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","text":"Viewing himself as a direct successor to the Roman Emperors of Antiquity, he was Emperor of the Romans from his papal coronation in 1220 until his death; he was also a claimant to the title of King of the Romans from 1212 and unopposed holder of that monarchy from 1215. As such, he was King of Germany, of Italy, and of Burgundy. At the age of three, he was crowned King of Sicily as a co-ruler with his mother, Constance of Hauteville, the daughter of Roger II of Sicily. His other royal title was King of Jerusalem by virtue of marriage and his connection with the Sixth Crusade.\nHe was frequently at war with the Papacy, hemmed in between Frederick's lands in northern Italy and his Kingdom of Sicily (the \"Regno\") to the south, and thus he was excommunicated four times and often vilified in pro-papal chronicles of the time and since. Pope Gregory IX went so far as to call him an Antichrist.\nSpeaking six languages (Latin, Sicilian, German, French, Greek and Arabic), Frederick was an avid patron of science and the arts. He played a major role in promoting literature through the Sicilian School of poetry. His Sicilian royal court in Palermo, from around 1220 to his death, saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo-Romance language, Sicilian. The poetry that emanated from the school had a significant influence on literature and on what was to become the modern Italian language. The school and its poetry were saluted by Dante and his peers and predate by at least a century the use of the Tuscan idiom as the elite literary language of Italy.\nHe was also the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered \"irrational\".\nAfter his death, his line quickly died out and the House of Hohenstaufen came to an end.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_Emperors","surface_form":"Roman Emperors","offset":45},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Emperor of the Romans","offset":81},{"uri":"King_of_the_Romans","surface_form":"King of the Romans","offset":193},{"uri":"King_of_Germany","surface_form":"King of Germany","offset":287},{"uri":"King_of_Italy","surface_form":"of Italy","offset":304},{"uri":"King_of_Burgundy","surface_form":"of Burgundy","offset":318},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sicily","surface_form":"King of Sicily","offset":367},{"uri":"Constance_of_Sicily","surface_form":"Constance of Hauteville","offset":413},{"uri":"Roger_II_of_Sicily","surface_form":"Roger II of Sicily","offset":454},{"uri":"King_of_Jerusalem","surface_form":"King of Jerusalem","offset":500},{"uri":"Sixth_Crusade","surface_form":"Sixth Crusade","offset":568},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sicily","surface_form":"Kingdom of Sicily","offset":687},{"uri":"Excommunication","surface_form":"excommunicated","offset":749},{"uri":"Pope_Gregory_IX","surface_form":"Pope Gregory IX","offset":841},{"uri":"Antichrist","surface_form":"Antichrist","offset":887},{"uri":"Sicilian_School","surface_form":"Sicilian School","offset":1088},{"uri":"Palermo","surface_form":"Palermo","offset":1143},{"uri":"Italo-Romance","surface_form":"Italo-Romance","offset":1226},{"uri":"Sicilian_language","surface_form":"Sicilian","offset":1250},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian language","offset":1380},{"uri":"Dante","surface_form":"Dante","offset":1440},{"uri":"Trial_by_ordeal","surface_form":"trials by ordeal","offset":1614},{"uri":"House_of_Hohenstaufen","surface_form":"House of Hohenstaufen","offset":1720}]}
