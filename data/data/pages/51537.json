{"id":51537,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A4ki","text":"In Finnish mythology, V\u00E4ki means races of Haltijas (Finnish elves) and their magical powers. Different things in nature had their own v\u00E4ki guarding them. For example, V\u00E4ki of water lived in and protected water. V\u00E4ki is the name of both the magical power and Haltijas. V\u00E4ki could sometimes be seen. They looked like little man-like creatures. Sometimes V\u00E4ki went inside people and made people ill. V\u00E4ki makes people ill if they behave badly in their kingdom. For example, if someone shouted in a forest without reason then the V\u00E4ki of forest may make then ill. Shaman could heal these illnesses by telling the v\u00E4ki to leave the person and go back to its original place.\nThe other version of v\u00E4ki refers to the realm of the dead. V\u00E4ki was the anonymous pack of dead people. Once they (v\u00E4ki) had been our beloved ones, relatives etc. but after spending some time in the afterlife they had been become unknown masses of dead creatures without any personal markings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Finnish_mythology","surface_form":"Finnish mythology","offset":3},{"uri":"Haltija","surface_form":"Haltija","offset":42},{"uri":"Elf","surface_form":"elves","offset":60},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":77},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":113},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":175},{"uri":"Man","surface_form":"man","offset":322},{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":331},{"uri":"Illness","surface_form":"ill","offset":392},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":449},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":495},{"uri":"Reason","surface_form":"reason","offset":510},{"uri":"Shaman","surface_form":"Shaman","offset":560}]}
