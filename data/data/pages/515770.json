{"id":515770,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Suites_(Bach)","text":"The \"Six suites for unaccompanied cello\" by Johann Sebastian Bach are some of the most often performed and recognizable solo compositions ever written for cello. They were most likely composed during the period 1717\u20131723, when Bach served as a Kapellmeister in K\u00F6then. The title of Anna Magdalena Bach's manuscript was \"Suites \u00E1 Violoncello Solo senza Basso\".\nThe suites have been performed and recorded by many famous cellists; like Mstislav Rostropovich, Emanuel Feuermann, Pierre Fournier, Jacqueline du Pr\u00E9, Paul Tortelier, Andr\u00E9 Navarra, Yo-Yo Ma, Gregor Piatigorsky, Mischa Maisky, J\u00E1nos Starker, Anner Bijlsma or Heinrich Schiff. Yo-Yo Ma won the 1985 Best Instrumental Soloist Grammy Award for his bestselling album \"Six Unaccompanied Cello Suites\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":44},{"uri":"Cello","surface_form":"cello","offset":155},{"uri":"Kapellmeister","surface_form":"Kapellmeister","offset":244},{"uri":"K%C3%B6then_(Anhalt)","surface_form":"K\u00F6then","offset":261},{"uri":"Anna_Magdalena_Bach","surface_form":"Anna Magdalena Bach","offset":282},{"uri":"Mstislav_Rostropovich","surface_form":"Mstislav Rostropovich","offset":434},{"uri":"Emanuel_Feuermann","surface_form":"Emanuel Feuermann","offset":457},{"uri":"Pierre_Fournier","surface_form":"Pierre Fournier","offset":476},{"uri":"Jacqueline_du_Pr%C3%A9","surface_form":"Jacqueline du Pr\u00E9","offset":493},{"uri":"Paul_Tortelier","surface_form":"Paul Tortelier","offset":512},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Navarra","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Navarra","offset":528},{"uri":"Yo-Yo_Ma","surface_form":"Yo-Yo Ma","offset":543},{"uri":"Gregor_Piatigorsky","surface_form":"Gregor Piatigorsky","offset":553},{"uri":"Mischa_Maisky","surface_form":"Mischa Maisky","offset":573},{"uri":"J%C3%A1nos_Starker","surface_form":"J\u00E1nos Starker","offset":588},{"uri":"Anner_Bijlsma","surface_form":"Anner Bijlsma","offset":603},{"uri":"Heinrich_Schiff","surface_form":"Heinrich Schiff","offset":620},{"uri":"Yo-Yo_Ma","surface_form":"Yo-Yo Ma","offset":637},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Best_Instrumental_Soloist_Performance_(without_orchestra)","surface_form":"Best Instrumental Soloist Grammy Award","offset":659}]}
