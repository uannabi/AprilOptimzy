The band's name comes from the name from Mills' uncle's ship, which sank. Only his uncle and one other crew mate survived. Since the spelling \"Odessa\" was already being used by a Scottish synth band, they instead used the Hungarian spelling, replacing the \"ss\" with \"sz\".\nIndividually, Mills is known as Catacombkid. Knight is known as Beaches Beaches. When asked\u00A0how Mills got his nickname he says, \"I got into Aesop Rock and he has a song called 'Catacomb Kids.' I thought it sounded cool.\" Knight got his nickname when, \"...I was high in my bedroom making music one day\u2026\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic music","offset":58},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":94},{"uri":"Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival","surface_form":"Coachella","offset":2178},{"uri":"Bonnaroo_Music_Festival","surface_form":"Bonnaroo Music Festival","offset":2268},{"uri":"Lollapalooza","surface_form":"Lollapalooza","offset":2533},{"uri":"Odesa","surface_form":"Odessa","offset":2933}]}
