{"id":5160,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London","text":"The Tower of London is an ancient Norman stone fortress in London, England. It stands on the bank of the River Thames, in the oldest part of the city.\nIt is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nHistory.\nThe fortress was built by William the Conqueror, King William I, starting in 1078. The moat was built by Richard I, using water diverted from the River Thames.\nThe Tower had many uses. Its main function was to protect Norman rule in the years after the conquest. It was a prison, and a place of execution. Today, the Crown Jewels are kept there. This is the collection of jewels owned by the British state, and sometimes worn by the monarch. There is also a museum of armour.\nThe Tower of London has a collection of ravens, large black birds of the Crow family. They are taken care of by the staff who work there. The ravens' wing feathers are kept short so they cannot fly away. This is because a legend (story) says that if the ravens leave the Tower, the Tower and the Kingdom will fall.\nThe closest Underground station to the Tower of London is Tower Hill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":26},{"uri":"Norman_architecture","surface_form":"Norman","offset":34},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":41},{"uri":"Fortress","surface_form":"fortress","offset":47},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":59},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":105},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":145},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":159},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":166},{"uri":"William_I_of_England","surface_form":"King William I","offset":245},{"uri":"Moat","surface_form":"moat","offset":283},{"uri":"Richard_I_of_England","surface_form":"Richard I","offset":301},{"uri":"Crown_Jewels","surface_form":"Crown Jewels","offset":513},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":629},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":654},{"uri":"Armour","surface_form":"armour","offset":664},{"uri":"Raven","surface_form":"raven","offset":712},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":732},{"uri":"Crow","surface_form":"Crow","offset":745},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"staff","offset":788},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":822},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":827},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":894},{"uri":"Kingdom","surface_form":"Kingdom","offset":968},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"Underground","offset":999}]}
