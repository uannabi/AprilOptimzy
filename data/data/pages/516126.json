He remained a faithful pet for many years after his owner died.\nLife.\nThe dog was born on a farm near the city of \u014Cdate in Akita Prefecture.\nIn 1924, Hidesabur\u014D Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the University of Tokyo, took Hachik\u014D, a golden brown Akita as a pet. During his owner's life, Hachik\u014D greeted him at the end of each day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The two kept their daily routine until May 1925, when Professor Ueno did not come back to the train station. The professor had died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Each day for the next nine years, nine months and fifteen days, Hachik\u014D waited for Ueno's return. He showed up at the exact time the train was due at the station.\nOther travellers begin to notice Hachik\u014D still showing up. Many of the people had seen Hachik\u014D and Professor Ueno meet each afternoon. At first, people who worked at the station were not very friendly to the dog. But after a story was written about him in \"Asahi Shinbun\", people started to bring Hachik\u014D treats and food for him to eat while he waited.\nAkitas in Japan.\nIn 1932 one of Ueno's students Hirokichi Saito (who had learned much about the Akita breed) saw the dog at the station. He followed him to the home of the former gardener of Professor Ueno\u2014Kikuzaboro Kobayashi, where he learned the history of Hachik\u014D's life. Shortly after this meeting, the former student published a census of all the Akitas in Japan. His research found only 30 purebred Akitas still alive, including Hachik\u014D from Shibuya Station.\nJapanese culture.\nSaito went back many times to visit Hachik\u014D. Over the years he wrote several news stories about the dog's remarkable loyalty. In 1932 one of these stories, published in the Tokyo \"Asahi Shinbun\", made Hachik\u014D a national sensation.\nHis faithfulness to his master's memory meant a spirit of family loyalty for all Japanese people to achieve. Teachers and parents used Hachik\u014D's devotional watching for his master as an example for children to follow. A well-known Japanese artist made a sculpture of the dog, and in Japan a new awareness of the Akita breed grew.\nAt last, Hachik\u014D's legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty to the Emperor of Japan himself.\nDeath.\nHachik\u014D died on March 8, 1935, and was found on a street in Shibuya.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Akita_Inu","surface_form":"Akita","offset":51},{"uri":"Loyalty","surface_form":"loyalty","offset":95},{"uri":"Akita_Prefecture","surface_form":"Akita Prefecture","offset":227},{"uri":"University_of_Tokyo","surface_form":"University of Tokyo","offset":320},{"uri":"Shibuya_Station","surface_form":"Shibuya Station","offset":468},{"uri":"Cerebral_hemorrhage","surface_form":"cerebral hemorrhage","offset":622},{"uri":"Asahi_Shinbun","surface_form":"Asahi Shinbun","offset":1063},{"uri":"Gardener","surface_form":"gardener","offset":1338},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":1494},{"uri":"Purebred_dog","surface_form":"purebred","offset":1556},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":1816},{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":1907},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":2128},{"uri":"Symbolism","surface_form":"symbol","offset":2264},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"Emperor of Japan","offset":2289}]}
