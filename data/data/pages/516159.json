The New York State Legislature meets in this building. The building is in the state's capital city, Albany. It is part of the Empire State Plaza on State Street in Capitol Park.\nHistory.\nThe building was completed in 1899. It cost $25 million. It was the most expensive government building of its time. The building is a mix of architectural styles. Because different architects were involved at different times, the building is a combination of Italian Renaissance and Romanesque architecture. It sits on a granite foundation. In addition to the State Assembly Chamber, it has the State Senate Chamber and the governor's office (also called the Red Room).\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The following year it was declared a National Historic Landmark.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capitol_building","surface_form":"capitol building","offset":34},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":58},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":72},{"uri":"New_York_State_Legislature","surface_form":"New York State Legislature","offset":86},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":141},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":168},{"uri":"Albany%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Albany","offset":182},{"uri":"Empire_State_Plaza","surface_form":"Empire State Plaza","offset":208},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":317},{"uri":"Expense","surface_form":"expensive","offset":342},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":352},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architectural styles","offset":410},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":450},{"uri":"Renaissance_Revival_architecture","surface_form":"Italian Renaissance","offset":528},{"uri":"Romanesque_architecture","surface_form":"Romanesque architecture","offset":552},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":590},{"uri":"Foundation_(engineering)","surface_form":"foundation","offset":598},{"uri":"New_York_State_Assembly","surface_form":"State Assembly Chamber","offset":629},{"uri":"New_York_State_Senate","surface_form":"State Senate Chamber","offset":664},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":693},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":704},{"uri":"National_Register_of_Historic_Places","surface_form":"National Register of Historic Places","offset":770},{"uri":"National_Historic_Landmark","surface_form":"National Historic Landmark","offset":853}]}
