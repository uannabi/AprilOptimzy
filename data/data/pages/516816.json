The castle-like building overlooks the Flensburg Fjord. Called the \"Red Castle\", it is well known for its beautiful architecture. It was patterned after the Marienburg (Malbork Castle) in Poland, the seat of the Teutonic Knights.\nHistory.\nThe academy was opened 1 October 1910. At the start of World War I in August 1914, the academy was temporarily closed. The Germans thought the war would be short. It reopened in January 1915. Cadets would spend three months training then go to sea to train aboard cruisers. At the end of World War II, after Adolf Hitler committed suicide, Admiral Karl D\u00F6nitz set up the last Nazi government at Flensburg-M\u00FCrwik academy. A few days later Germany surrendered.\nCurrently cadets spend a year at Flensburg-M\u00FCrwik academy before going on to study at the F\u00FChrungsakademie der Bundeswehr in Hamburg or the Bundeswehr University Munich.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_Navy","surface_form":"German Navy","offset":84},{"uri":"Flensburg","surface_form":"Flensburg","offset":108},{"uri":"M%C3%BCrwik","surface_form":"M\u00FCrwik","offset":118},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":130},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":142},{"uri":"Flensburg_Fjord","surface_form":"Flensburg Fjord","offset":165},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":242},{"uri":"Pattern","surface_form":"pattern","offset":263},{"uri":"Marienburg","surface_form":"Marienburg","offset":283},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":314},{"uri":"Teutonic_Knight","surface_form":"Teutonic Knight","offset":338},{"uri":"Academy","surface_form":"academy","offset":369},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":420},{"uri":"Cadet","surface_form":"Cadet","offset":557},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":609},{"uri":"Cruiser","surface_form":"cruiser","offset":629},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":653},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":673},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":696},{"uri":"Admiral","surface_form":"Admiral","offset":705},{"uri":"Karl_D%C3%B6nitz","surface_form":"Karl D\u00F6nitz","offset":713},{"uri":"Nazi_Party","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":741},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":803},{"uri":"Surrender_(military)","surface_form":"surrendered","offset":811},{"uri":"F%C3%BChrungsakademie_der_Bundeswehr","surface_form":"F\u00FChrungsakademie der Bundeswehr","offset":914},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":949},{"uri":"Bundeswehr_University_Munich","surface_form":"Bundeswehr University Munich","offset":964}]}
