{"id":516925,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A bye in sports and other competitive activities can have two different meanings. Both mean that a participant in a competition is not required to compete while most of the other participants are. Its main use is in tournament competitions. In single-elimination tournaments, when there are an odd number of participants, a bye allows one or more to play in a later round. Other types of eliminator tournaments may also include a bye for others reasons. An example would be as a reward for the best ranked team(s).\nIn round-robin tournaments where there are an odd number of competitors, usually one gets a bye in each round. However, over the whole tournament, each team plays the same number of games.\nSimilar to the round-robin context, in leagues where most teams play on the same days during regular-season play, a team that does not play on a given day is said to be on bye. In sports that are played weekly, especially gridiron football, a team that does not play at all during a given week is said to be on its bye week. For example, during the regular football Season in the NFL, each team gets a week off (bye week) during the regular season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sports","surface_form":"sports","offset":22},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competitive activities","offset":39},{"uri":"Participant","surface_form":"participant","offset":112},{"uri":"Compete","surface_form":"compete","offset":160},{"uri":"Tournament","surface_form":"tournament","offset":229},{"uri":"Elimination","surface_form":"elimination","offset":264},{"uri":"Odd_number","surface_form":"odd number","offset":307},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":470},{"uri":"Ranked","surface_form":"ranked","offset":512},{"uri":"Round-robin","surface_form":"round-robin","offset":531},{"uri":"League","surface_form":"league","offset":756},{"uri":"Gridiron_football","surface_form":"gridiron football","offset":939},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":1046},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":1074},{"uri":"Season_(sports)","surface_form":"Season","offset":1083},{"uri":"NFL","surface_form":"NFL","offset":1097},{"uri":"Regular_season","surface_form":"regular season","offset":1150}]}
