It is the largest package delivery company in the world. UPS delivers more than 14 million packages a day to more than 200 countries. It is based in Sandy Springs, Georgia, USA. The company started in 1936 when several smaller companies merged and took the new name. It was owned by employees until 1999 when it offered stock to outsiders.\nThe company uses brown uniforms and delivery trucks.
