{"id":517063,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doo-wop","text":"Doo-wop is a genre of music that was developed in African-American communities in The USA. It started in the 1940s. Doo-wop achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (1914\u20131978) is often called the \"Godfather of Doo-wop\". He introduced the \"top and bottom\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics.\nThe first record to use the syllables \"doo-wop\" was the 1955 hit \"When You Dance\" by the Turbans. The term \"doo-wop\" first appeared in print in 1961. During the late 1950s many Italian-American groups added to the doo-wop scene. The peak of doo-wop was in 1961. Doo-wop's influence continued in soul, pop, and rock groups of the 1960s. At various times in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the genre has seen revivals. Doo-wop was a precursor to many of the afro-American musical styles seen today. An evolution of jazz and blues, doo-wop also influenced many of the major Rock and Roll groups that defined the later decades of the 20th century. Doo-wop is iconic for it\u2019s swing-like beats and using the off-beat to keep time. Doo-wop laid the foundation for many musical innovations, for example, R&B.\nIt has had a revival recently as Meghan Trainor usually makes songs with in the genre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical_genre","surface_form":"genre of music","offset":13},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":50},{"uri":"Mainstream","surface_form":"mainstream","offset":133},{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popularity","offset":144},{"uri":"Vocal_harmony","surface_form":"vocal harmony","offset":196},{"uri":"Bill_Kenny_(singer)","surface_form":"Bill Kenny","offset":295},{"uri":"Format","surface_form":"format","offset":397},{"uri":"Tenor","surface_form":"tenor","offset":426},{"uri":"Lead_vocals","surface_form":"lead","offset":444},{"uri":"Bass_(vocal_range)","surface_form":"bass","offset":455},{"uri":"Lyric","surface_form":"lyric","offset":480},{"uri":"Harmony","surface_form":"harmony","offset":543},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":561},{"uri":"Beat_(music)","surface_form":"beat","offset":581},{"uri":"Instrumentation","surface_form":"instrumentation","offset":610},{"uri":"The_Turbans","surface_form":"the Turbans","offset":741},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"print","offset":791},{"uri":"Italian-American","surface_form":"Italian-American","offset":833},{"uri":"Soul_music","surface_form":"soul","offset":951},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":957},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":966},{"uri":"Precursor","surface_form":"precursor","offset":1084},{"uri":"African-American_people","surface_form":"afro-American","offset":1109},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1153},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":1166},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":1175},{"uri":"Rock_and_Roll","surface_form":"Rock and Roll","offset":1224},{"uri":"Decade","surface_form":"decade","offset":1268},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":1283},{"uri":"Icon","surface_form":"icon","offset":1308},{"uri":"Innovation","surface_form":"innovation","offset":1423},{"uri":"R%26amp%3BB","surface_form":"R&B","offset":1449},{"uri":"Meghan_Trainor","surface_form":"Meghan Trainor","offset":1487},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":1516}]}
