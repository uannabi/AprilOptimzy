{"id":5171,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix","text":"\"The Matrix\" is a science fiction action movie that was made in 1999. It was written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers. The main actors in the movie are Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving. \"The Matrix\" was followed by two sequels: \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\".\nStory.\nThe main character of the movie is Thomas A. Anderson (played by Keanu Reeves), who is a computer programmer at MetaCortex, a big software company, but he is also an underground hacker. Thomas meets Trinity (played by Carrie-Anne Moss), who then introduces him to Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), who gives him a choice between taking a blue pill or a red pill. If he took the blue pill, he would wake up at his bed and wouldn't be bothered anymore, but if he took the red pill, Morpheus would show him the truth about the Matrix. Thomas takes the red pill. Then Morpheus tells Thomas he is actually Neo, or \"the one\". He explains to Neo that the Matrix is a computer program made by robots to simulate a world which humans think is real. He then explains to Neo that, because he is \"the one\" he is able to modify the Matrix however he wants. Morpheus then helps Neo to get out of the Matrix. At the beginning, Neo is skeptical about his power, but after training, he is able to show his real power. Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the rest of the rebels then go on a journey to free humans from the Matrix.\nSymbolism.\nThere is a lot of symbolism in \"The Matrix\". Common sources are Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism (the concept of maya), the ancient philosopher Plato and \"Plato's Cave\", modern philosophers such as Ren\u00E9 Descartes, and modern authors such as William Gibson.\nDescartes says that maybe humans are brains in jars. A monster is maybe tricking humans. The monster makes humans believe that they are in the real world, but actually humans are simply brains. Humans cannot know what is real.\nPhilosophy.\nThere are also references to \"Simulacra and Simulation\", a very modern philosophy book by Jean Baudrillard. Baudrillard says that in the modern world, copies of copies are made. \"The Real\" is gone because people do not know what the first things were. For example, a modern person who eats a chicken did not kill the chicken. That person does not know what a real chicken is. The chicken meat is false because the person did not kill the chicken. The person's reality is the chicken meat.\nMusic.\nDon Davis made the score (orchestra part with violins and flutes).\nThe Matrix's soundtrack (band music for a movie) includes music from bands such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Massive Attack, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, and Marilyn Manson.\nOther meanings.\nThe word \"matrix\" sometimes means \"origin\" or \"beginnings\". In very old English, \"matrix\" means \"womb\". A matrix is also a part of mathematics.\nEffect of the movie.\nA new religion called Matrixism or The path of the One is based on the movie \"The Matrix\". The religion began in 2004 with 300 members. Now there are about 16,000 members of Matrixism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":18},{"uri":"Wachowski_Brothers","surface_form":"Wachowski Brothers","offset":105},{"uri":"Keanu_Reeves","surface_form":"Keanu Reeves","offset":158},{"uri":"Laurence_Fishburne","surface_form":"Laurence Fishburne","offset":172},{"uri":"Carrie-Anne_Moss","surface_form":"Carrie-Anne Moss","offset":192},{"uri":"Hugo_Weaving","surface_form":"Hugo Weaving","offset":214},{"uri":"The_Matrix_Reloaded","surface_form":"The Matrix Reloaded","offset":271},{"uri":"The_Matrix_Revolutions","surface_form":"The Matrix Revolutions","offset":297},{"uri":"Keanu_Reeves","surface_form":"Keanu Reeves","offset":394},{"uri":"Hacker","surface_form":"hacker","offset":507},{"uri":"Carrie-Anne_Moss","surface_form":"Carrie-Anne Moss","offset":547},{"uri":"Laurence_Fishburne","surface_form":"Laurence Fishburne","offset":613},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":996},{"uri":"Skepticism","surface_form":"skeptical","offset":1255},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1469},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":1515},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":1529},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":1539},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":1595},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophers","offset":1628},{"uri":"Ren%C3%A9_Descartes","surface_form":"Ren\u00E9 Descartes","offset":1649},{"uri":"Jean_Baudrillard","surface_form":"Jean Baudrillard","offset":2037},{"uri":"Rammstein","surface_form":"Rammstein","offset":2593},{"uri":"Rage_Against_the_Machine","surface_form":"Rage Against the Machine","offset":2616},{"uri":"Marilyn_Manson_(band)","surface_form":"Marilyn Manson","offset":2703},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"womb","offset":2832},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrix","offset":2841},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":2866},{"uri":"Matrixism","surface_form":"Matrixism","offset":2922},{"uri":"Matrixism","surface_form":"Matrixism","offset":3074}]}
