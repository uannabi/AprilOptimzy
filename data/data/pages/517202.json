{"id":517202,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartouche","text":"A cartouche is a hieroglyphic symbol of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. It is oval with a horizontal line at one end, showing that the text enclosed is a royal name.\nIt starts to be used at the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty under Pharaoh Sneferu. The cartouche is usually vertical with a horizontal line, but it is horizontal if it makes the name fit better, with a vertical line on the left. The Ancient Egyptian word for it was \"shenu\". In demotic writing, the cartouche was reduced to a pair of brackets and a vertical line.\nOf the five royal titles it was the \"prenomen\", the throne name, and the \"Son of Ra\" titulary, the so-called \"nomen\" name given at birth, which were enclosed by a cartouche.\nAt times amulets were given the form of a cartouche displaying the name of a king and placed in tombs. Such items are often important to archaeologists for dating the tomb and its contents. Cartouches were only worn by pharaohs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hieroglyph","surface_form":"hieroglyph","offset":17},{"uri":"Ancient_Egyptian","surface_form":"ancient Egyptian","offset":43},{"uri":"Pharaoh","surface_form":"pharaoh","offset":60},{"uri":"Oval","surface_form":"oval","offset":75},{"uri":"Pharaoh","surface_form":"royal","offset":151},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"Dynasty","offset":215},{"uri":"Sneferu","surface_form":"Sneferu","offset":237},{"uri":"Egyptian_language","surface_form":"Ancient Egyptian","offset":396},{"uri":"Amulet","surface_form":"amulet","offset":710}]}
