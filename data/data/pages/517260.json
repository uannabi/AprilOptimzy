{"id":517260,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Dynasty_of_Egypt","text":"The Second Dynasty ruled ancient Egypt from c. 2890 to c. 2686\u00A0BC It is the second dynasty of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. During this time the seat of government was centred at Thinis. Very little is known about this period in ancient Egyptian history.\nThere is very little archaeological evidence of the time. But to compare the differences between the First and Third Dynasties shows that there must have important institutional and economic developments during the Second Dynasty.\nRulers.\nManetho wrote that the capital was at Thinis, the same as during the First Dynasty. However, at least the first three kings were buried at Saqqara. This could mean the center of power had moved to Memphis. Beyond this, little can be said about the events during this period. The annual records on the Palermo Stone only survive for the end of the reign of Nebra and for parts of Nynetjer's. One important event possibly happened during the reign of Khasekhemwy: many Egyptologists read his name (\"the Two Powers arise\") as commemorating the union of the Upper and Lower Egypts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"ancient Egypt","offset":25},{"uri":"Early_Dynastic_Period_(Egypt)","surface_form":"Early Dynastic Period of Egypt","offset":98},{"uri":"Thinis","surface_form":"Thinis","offset":185},{"uri":"First_Dynasty_of_Egypt","surface_form":"First","offset":362},{"uri":"Third_Dynasty_of_Egypt","surface_form":"Third","offset":372},{"uri":"Manetho","surface_form":"Manetho","offset":500},{"uri":"Thinis","surface_form":"Thinis","offset":538},{"uri":"Saqqara","surface_form":"Saqqara","offset":639},{"uri":"Memphis%2C_Egypt","surface_form":"Memphis","offset":697},{"uri":"Palermo_Stone","surface_form":"Palermo Stone","offset":801},{"uri":"Raneb","surface_form":"Nebra","offset":856},{"uri":"Nynetjer","surface_form":"Nynetjer","offset":879},{"uri":"Khasekhemwy","surface_form":"Khasekhemwy","offset":949},{"uri":"Upper_Egypt","surface_form":"Upper","offset":1054},{"uri":"Lower_Egypt","surface_form":"Lower Egypt","offset":1064}]}
