{"id":517332,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_haemochromatosis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hereditary haemochromatosis is a disease caused by a genetic disorder in which a person accumulates a dangerous level of iron in a body.\nHumans, like most animals, have no means to excrete excess iron. Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs disrupting their normal function.\nThe hereditary form of the disease is most common among those of Northern European ancestry, in particular those of Celtic descent. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":46},{"uri":"Genetic_disorder","surface_form":"genetic disorder","offset":66},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":134},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"Human","offset":150},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":168},{"uri":"Excrete","surface_form":"excrete","offset":194},{"uri":"Tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":242},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":254},{"uri":"Celt","surface_form":"Celt","offset":411},{"uri":"Autosomal_recessive","surface_form":"autosomal recessive","offset":458}]}
