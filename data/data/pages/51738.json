The actual color of the metal, used for example in gilding, is called Metallic gold. Gold paint can be made by mixing brown, yellow paint and orange paint.\nThe web color \"gold\" (shown at right) is sometimes referred to as golden in order to distinguish it from the element \"gold\". The use of \"gold\" as a color term in traditional usage is more often applied to the color \"gold (metallic)\" (shown below).\nThe first recorded use of \"golden\" as a color name in English was in the year 1300 to refer to the element gold and in 1423 to refer to blonde hair.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":37},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":100},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":106},{"uri":"Paint","surface_form":"paint","offset":202},{"uri":"Web_color","surface_form":"web color","offset":272},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":570},{"uri":"Blonde","surface_form":"blonde","offset":652}]}
