{"id":517439,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A mantle is a layer inside a planetary body that is between the core and the crust of a planetary body. Mantles are made of rock or ices. They are generally the largest layer of the planetary body. All terrestrial planets, a number of asteroids, and some moons have mantles.\nEarth's mantle.\nThe Earth's mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core. Its mass is 4.01 \u00D7 1024 kg. It makes up 67% the mass of the Earth. It has a thickness of 2,900\u00A0kilometres (1,800\u00A0mi). It makes up about 84% of Earth's volume. The Earth's mantle behaves as a viscous fluid.\nOther planetary mantles.\nMercury has a silicate mantle that is approximately 490\u00A0km thick. Mercury's mantle makes up 28% of its mass. Venus's silicate mantle is approximately 2800\u00A0km thick. Venus's mantle makes up around 70% of its mass. Mars's silicate mantle is approximately 1600\u00A0km thick. Mar's mantle makes up 74\u201388% of its mass.\nMoons with mantles.\nJupiter's moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede have silicate mantles. Io's mantle is 1100\u00A0km thick. Ganymede's mantle is 1315\u00A0km thick. Europa's mantle is 1165\u00A0km thick. The silicate mantle of the Moon is approximately 1300\u20131400\u00A0km thick. Titan and Triton each have a mantle made of ice or other solid volatile substances.\nAsteroids with mantles.\nSome of the largest asteroids have mantles. For example, Vesta has a silicate mantle similar in composition to diogenite meteorites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planetary body","offset":42},{"uri":"Core","surface_form":"core","offset":77},{"uri":"Crust_(geology)","surface_form":"crust","offset":90},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":137},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ices","offset":145},{"uri":"Terrestrial_planet","surface_form":"terrestrial planets","offset":215},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroids","offset":248},{"uri":"Moons","surface_form":"moons","offset":268},{"uri":"Silicate","surface_form":"silicate","offset":337},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":393},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":540},{"uri":"Viscosity","surface_form":"viscous","offset":580},{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":588},{"uri":"Mercury_(planet)","surface_form":"Mercury","offset":620},{"uri":"Approximately","surface_form":"approximately","offset":658},{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Venus's","offset":729},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars's","offset":833},{"uri":"Io_(moon)","surface_form":"Io","offset":966},{"uri":"Europa_(moon)","surface_form":"Europa","offset":970},{"uri":"Ganymede_(moon)","surface_form":"Ganymede","offset":982},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":1141},{"uri":"Titan_(moon)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":1183},{"uri":"Triton_(moon)","surface_form":"Triton","offset":1193},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":1240},{"uri":"Volatiles","surface_form":"volatile","offset":1246},{"uri":"Substance","surface_form":"substances","offset":1255},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroids","offset":1311},{"uri":"Vesta","surface_form":"Vesta","offset":1348},{"uri":"Diogenite","surface_form":"diogenite","offset":1402},{"uri":"Meteorites","surface_form":"meteorites","offset":1412}]}
