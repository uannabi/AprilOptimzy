{"id":517954,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language","text":"=\"preserve\">The\u00A0Unified Modeling Language\u00A0(UML) is a general-purpose, developmental,\u00A0modeling language\u00A0in the field of\u00A0software engineering. UML is used to provide a standard way to show what the design of a system looks like.\nUML was originally developed to standardize the different notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed by\u00A0Grady Booch,\u00A0Ivar Jacobson\u00A0and\u00A0James Rumbaugh\u00A0at\u00A0Rational Software\u00A0in 1994\u201395, with further development led by them through 1996.\nIn 1997, UML was adopted as a standard by the\u00A0Object Management Group\u00A0(OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 the Unified Modeling Language was also published by the\u00A0International Organization for Standardization\u00A0(ISO) as an approved ISO standard.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Software_engineering","surface_form":"software engineering","offset":119},{"uri":"Grady_Booch","surface_form":"Grady Booch","offset":359},{"uri":"Ivar_Jacobson","surface_form":"Ivar Jacobson","offset":372},{"uri":"James_Rumbaugh","surface_form":"James Rumbaugh","offset":390},{"uri":"Rational_Software","surface_form":"Rational Software","offset":408},{"uri":"Object_Management_Group","surface_form":"Object Management Group","offset":535},{"uri":"International_Organization_for_Standardization","surface_form":"International Organization for Standardization","offset":684}]}
