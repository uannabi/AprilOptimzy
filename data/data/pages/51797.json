Most often this means that a freedom fighter wants his people to have own nation and independence and/or get rid of oppressors. People who think like this are said to think in a nationalist way\nFreedom fighter is a \"relativistic\" term - this means a person decides by his or her point of view if he call some persons or groups freedom fighters or not. Freedom fighter is a \"positive\" term - this means that he or she calls a person \"freedom fighter\" only if he or she supports the goals of the freedom fighter. If people do not support his goals, they probably use more \"negative\" terms like insurgent, terrorist, rebel or criminal.\nFreedom fighters are often called terrorists by their opponents if they hurt civilians. However, not all freedom fighters hurt civilians. Some freedom fighters damage the opposing military. Some freedom fighters damage property - this is called sabotage. There are also freedom fighters who do not use violence at all. For example, the Mahatma Gandhi and the Dalai Lama.\nGroups.\nThese are examples of groups who call themselves freedom fighters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":52},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"free","offset":72},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":198},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":209},{"uri":"Oppressor","surface_form":"oppressor","offset":240},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalist","offset":302},{"uri":"Point_of_view","surface_form":"point of view","offset":403},{"uri":"Insurgent","surface_form":"insurgent","offset":716},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":727},{"uri":"Rebel","surface_form":"rebel","offset":738},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"criminal","offset":747},{"uri":"Terrorists","surface_form":"terrorists","offset":791},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":834},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":937},{"uri":"Sabotage","surface_form":"sabotage","offset":1002},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":1059},{"uri":"Mahatma_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mahatma Gandhi","offset":1093},{"uri":"Dalai_Lama","surface_form":"Dalai Lama","offset":1116}]}
