{"id":51805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(joinery)","text":"=\"preserve\">In joinery, a groove is a slot or trench cut into a member which runs parallel to the grain. A groove is something else than a dado, which runs across the grain.\nGrooves are used for several purposes in cabinet making and other woodworking fields. Typically, a groove is used to house the panels in frame and panel construction and the bottoms drawers.\nA groove may be \"through\", meaning that it passes all the way through the surface and its ends are open, or \"stopped\", meaning that one or both of the ends finish before the groove meets edge of the surface.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Joinery","surface_form":"joinery","offset":15},{"uri":"Slot","surface_form":"slot","offset":38},{"uri":"Trench","surface_form":"trench","offset":46},{"uri":"Wood_grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":98},{"uri":"Dado_(joinery)","surface_form":"dado","offset":139},{"uri":"Cabinet_making","surface_form":"cabinet making","offset":215},{"uri":"Woodworking","surface_form":"woodworking","offset":240},{"uri":"Frame_and_panel","surface_form":"frame and panel","offset":311},{"uri":"Drawer","surface_form":"drawer","offset":356}]}
