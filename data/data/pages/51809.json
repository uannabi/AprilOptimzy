{"id":51809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepultura","text":"Sepultura is a thrash metal/death metal/groove metal band from Brazil that has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. The brothers Max and Igor Cavalera started it in Belo Horizonte in 1984. The two brothers have left the band since, Max in 1996, and Igor in 2006, with American singer Derrick Green and drummer Jean Dolabella replacing them after their exits, although Dolabella left in 2011 to be replaced with Eloy Casagrande.\nHistory.\nThe band's name is Portuguese for the word \"grave\". The Cavalera brothers chose this name after translating English band Motorhead's song called \"Dancing On Your Grave\".\nSinger Wagner Lamounier and bass player Paulo Jr. were the first stable members to join the band along the Cavaleras. Lamounier left after a year and Max decided to sing as well as play guitar. The band added a second guitar player named Jairo Guedez. These members recorded their first album \"Morbid Visions\" in 1986. The song \"Troops of Doom\" from this album gave the band a small amount of popularity.\nGuedez left after the album was released, being replaced by Andreas Kisser. This line-up lasted until 1996 and accomplished several things. They recorded five more albums, where they began to play a more thrash metal sound than death/black metal in the first three albums, Schizophrenia (1987), Beneath The Remains (1989) and Arise (1991), and then moved on to groove metal with the last two of these five albums, Chaos A.D. (1993) and Roots (1996). Popular songs from the Chaos A.D. include Refuse/Resist and Roots Bloody Roots. On Roots, they also included a song they recorded with the Brazilian Xavantes tribe called Itsari, who also toured with them.\nConflicts between Max and the other members led to Max leaving the band. He was replaced with American singer Derrick Green. Although the band's album sales have lowered with each album released with Green, he remains in the group today, having recorded the albums Against (1998), Nation (2001), Roorback (2003), Dante XXI (2006), A-Lex (2009) and Kairos (2011) with the band.\nIgor Cavalera left the band in 2006 after Dante XXI. A year later, he made up with his brother Max, and the two formed The Cavalera Conspiracy. Igor's first replacement in Sepultura was Jean Dolabella, who recored A-Lex and Kairos with the band before quitting. The band's drummer today is Eloy Casagrande.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thrash_metal","surface_form":"thrash metal","offset":15},{"uri":"Death_metal","surface_form":"death metal","offset":28},{"uri":"Groove_metal","surface_form":"groove metal","offset":40},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":53},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":63},{"uri":"Belo_Horizonte","surface_form":"Belo Horizonte","offset":167},{"uri":"1984","surface_form":"1984","offset":185}]}
