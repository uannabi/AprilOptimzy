{"id":518243,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk","text":"=\"preserve\">An asterisk * is a typographic symbol or glyph.\nIt is so-called because it looks like an image of a star. Computer scientists and mathematicians often speak it as star. Example: \"the A* search algorithm\".\nIn English, an asterisk is usually five-pointed or six-pointed in typefaces, and six- or eight-pointed when handwritten. It can be used as censorship. It is also used on the internet to correct one's spelling, in which case it appears after the correct word.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Typographic","surface_form":"typographic","offset":31},{"uri":"Glyph","surface_form":"glyph","offset":53},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"Computer","offset":118},{"uri":"A%2A_search_algorithm","surface_form":"A* search algorithm","offset":195},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"typefaces","offset":283}]}
