It was released on 23 May 2014 by Epic Records, Syco Music and Mr. Kanani. Lloyd herself co-wrote five songs on the tracklist, working with new producers and songwriters such as Beth Ditto and Tove Lo. It is her last album released through Epic and Syco.\nBackground.\nOn 16 October 2013, Lloyd told \"Billboard\" that the title of her second studio album is \"Sorry I'm Late\". She explained, \"I think it has two meanings. [...] It's been a long time since I've actually done anything new, but for me, it's as a person. I mean, I've spent a whole lot of time trying to figure out who I am, and I think everybody goes through that.\" Lloyd confirmed that \"Sorry I'm Late\", which was originally due for release in November, was pushed back until early 2014, despite the record being done.\nThe explicit version of the album artwork depicts Lloyd smoking while sitting in a bathtub; censored pressings of the record remove the smoke.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mytalk","surface_form":"user talk page","offset":243},{"uri":"Emailing_users","surface_form":"email","offset":262},{"uri":"Blocking_policy","surface_form":"Blocking policy","offset":322},{"uri":"Username_policy","surface_form":"Username policy","offset":340},{"uri":"Appealing_a_block","surface_form":"policy","offset":376},{"uri":"Guide_to_appealing_blocks","surface_form":"guide","offset":387},{"uri":"Cher_Lloyd","surface_form":"Cher Lloyd","offset":589},{"uri":"Epic_Records","surface_form":"Epic Records","offset":635},{"uri":"Syco_Music","surface_form":"Syco Music","offset":649},{"uri":"Beth_Ditto","surface_form":"Beth Ditto","offset":779},{"uri":"Tove_Lo","surface_form":"Tove Lo","offset":794},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard","offset":900}]}
