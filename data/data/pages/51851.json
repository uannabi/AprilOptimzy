{"id":51851,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">In formal number theory a G\u00F6del numbering is a function which assigns to each symbol and formula of some formal language a unique natural number called a G\u00F6del number (GN). The concept was first used by Kurt G\u00F6del for the proof of his incompleteness theorem.\nA G\u00F6del numbering can be interpreted as an encoding where a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation, and a stream of natural numbers can then represent some form or function. A numbering of the set of computable functions can then be represented by a stream of G\u00F6del numbers (also called effective numbers). Rogers' equivalence theorem states criteria for which those numberings of the set of computable functions are G\u00F6del numberings.\nDefinition.\nGiven a countable set \"S\", a G\u00F6del numbering is an injective function\nwith both \"f\" and formula_1 (the inverse of \"f\") being computable functions.\nBase notation and strings.\nOne of the simplest G\u00F6del numbering schemes is used every day: The correspondence between integers and their representations as strings of symbols. For example, the sequence 2 3 is understood, by a particular set of rules, to correspond to the number twenty-three. Similarly, strings of symbols from some alphabet of \"N\" symbols can be encoded by identifying each symbol with a number from 0 to \"N\" and reading the string as the base \"N\"+1 representation of an integer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":23},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":60},{"uri":"Formal_language","surface_form":"formal language","offset":118},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":143},{"uri":"Kurt_G%C3%B6del","surface_form":"Kurt G\u00F6del","offset":216},{"uri":"G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem","surface_form":"incompleteness theorem","offset":248},{"uri":"Encoding","surface_form":"encoding","offset":315},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":359},{"uri":"Mathematical_notation","surface_form":"mathematical notation","offset":371},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":410},{"uri":"Numbering_(computability_theory)","surface_form":"numbering","offset":470},{"uri":"Computable_function","surface_form":"computable function","offset":494},{"uri":"Rogers%27_equivalence_theorem","surface_form":"Rogers' equivalence theorem","offset":601},{"uri":"Countable_set","surface_form":"countable set","offset":749},{"uri":"Injective_function","surface_form":"injective function","offset":792},{"uri":"Inverse_function","surface_form":"inverse","offset":844},{"uri":"Computable_function","surface_form":"computable function","offset":866},{"uri":"Base_(mathematics)","surface_form":"base","offset":1344}]}
