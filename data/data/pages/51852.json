{"id":51852,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, computer science and linguistics, a formal language is one that has a particular set of symbols, and whose expressions are made according to a particular set of rules. The symbol formula_1 is often used as a variable for formal languages in logic.\nUnlike natural languages, the symbols and formulas in formal languages are syntactically and semantically related to one another in a precise way. As a result, formal languages are completely (or almost completely) void of ambiguity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":29},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguistics","offset":50},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":237},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":270},{"uri":"Natural_language","surface_form":"natural languages","offset":284},{"uri":"Ambiguity","surface_form":"ambiguity","offset":500}]}
