{"id":51865,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function","text":"e=\"preserve\">An inverse function is a concept of mathematics. A function will calculate some output formula_1, given some input formula_1. This is usually written formula_1. The inverse function does the reverse. Let's say formula_1 is the inverse function of formula_1, then formula_1. Or otherwise put, formula_1. An inverse function to formula_1 is usually called formula_1. It is not to be confused with formula_1, which is a reciprocal function.\nExamples.\nIf formula_1 over real formula_1, then formula_1\nTo find the inverse function, swap the roles of formula_1 and formula_1 and solve for formula_1. For example, formula_1 would turn to formula_1, and then formula_1. This shows that the inverse function of formula_1 is formula_1.\nNot all functions have inverse functions: for example, function formula_1 has none (because formula_1, and formula_1 cannot be both 1 and -1), but every binary relation has its own inverse relation.\nIn some cases, finding the inverse of a function can be very difficult to do.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":49},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":64},{"uri":"Real","surface_form":"real","offset":479},{"uri":"Binary_relation","surface_form":"binary relation","offset":892}]}
