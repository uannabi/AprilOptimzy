Her parents were Henrietta Howland Robinson and Edward Henry Green. Her brother was Edward Howland Robinson Green (1868\u20131936).

They were married in Morristown, New Jersey February 23, 1909; she was 32 and he was 63.

The list of assets included 36 pages of bonds, eight pages of blue chip stocks, and $31 million in a non-interest bearing checking account. Her will was found in a tin cabinet with four bars of soap.

The rest was divided between 63 charities and educational institutions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wealthy","surface_form":"wealthiest","offset":93},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":117},{"uri":"Hoboken%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Hoboken, New Jersey","offset":161},{"uri":"Parents","surface_form":"parents","offset":205},{"uri":"Henrietta_Howland_Robinson","surface_form":"Henrietta Howland Robinson","offset":218},{"uri":"Edward_Howland_Robinson_Green","surface_form":"Edward Howland Robinson Green","offset":285},{"uri":"Grandson","surface_form":"grandson","offset":379},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America's","offset":391},{"uri":"Millionaire","surface_form":"millionaire","offset":407},{"uri":"John_Jacob_Astor","surface_form":"John Jacob Astor","offset":420},{"uri":"Morristown%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Morristown, New Jersey","offset":459},{"uri":"Estate_(law)","surface_form":"estate","offset":667},{"uri":"Assets","surface_form":"assets","offset":733},{"uri":"Bond_(finance)","surface_form":"bond","offset":761},{"uri":"Blue_chip_(stock_market)","surface_form":"blue chip stocks","offset":783},{"uri":"Interest_bearing","surface_form":"interest bearing","offset":826},{"uri":"Transaction_account","surface_form":"checking account","offset":843},{"uri":"Will_(law)","surface_form":"will","offset":865},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":885},{"uri":"Cupboard","surface_form":"cabinet","offset":889},{"uri":"Soap","surface_form":"bars of soap","offset":907},{"uri":"Consanguinity","surface_form":"genetic","offset":957},{"uri":"Cousin","surface_form":"cousin","offset":977},{"uri":"Probate","surface_form":"probate","offset":1027},{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charities","offset":1068},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"educational institutions","offset":1082}]}
