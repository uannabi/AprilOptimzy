{"id":519,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnifying_glass","text":"A magnifying glass is a lens through which can be used to make things appear bigger, so you can see them better. It is used in many applications and manual operations, e.g., for examining postage stamps in philately.\nThe magnifying glass consists of a piece of convex-shaped glass or plastic. It has to be held at the right distance between the eye and the object for the object to be in focus. The magnifying glass usually comes with a handle. A telescope is a more advanced kind of magnifying glass and consists of at least two glass lenses.\nA pair of binoculars is like a telescope for each eye. \"Spectacles\" or eyeglasses also use lenses to correct a person's vision.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lens_(optics)","surface_form":"lens","offset":24},{"uri":"Postage_stamps","surface_form":"postage stamps","offset":188},{"uri":"Philately","surface_form":"philately","offset":206},{"uri":"Focus_(optics)","surface_form":"focus","offset":388},{"uri":"Telescope","surface_form":"telescope","offset":447},{"uri":"Binoculars","surface_form":"binoculars","offset":554},{"uri":"Eyeglasses","surface_form":"eyeglasses","offset":615}]}
