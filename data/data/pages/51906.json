A wide range of tones of puce are shown below.\nChinese dried plums, a favorite snack among Chinese people worldwide, can be said to be puce coloured.\nWhere the name came from.\nThe name is from the French word \"puce\" which means \"flea\". Some people say that the colour name comes from the colour of a squashed flea or the colour of a flea full of blood. Other people say that colour name comes from the flea's droppings of digested blood, which spread out in deep red stain when water contacts them. Still others say that the colour name means the colour of the belly of a flea.\nOn the other hand, the colour name may refer to blue-lavender of the Pennyroyal flower, also named \"puce\" in French. The name may come from the use of strong-smelling Pennyroyal to ward off fleas.[http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/p/pennyr23.html]\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED) dates the use of \"puce\" (in \"couleur puce\")in English from 1787. The first recorded use of \"puce\" as a color name was in the 14th century, in the French language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gray","surface_form":"gray","offset":17},{"uri":"Red-violet","surface_form":"red-violet","offset":25},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":36},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":99},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":106},{"uri":"Purple","surface_form":"purple","offset":115},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":159},{"uri":"Brown","surface_form":"brown","offset":201},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":405},{"uri":"Flea","surface_form":"flea","offset":517},{"uri":"Pennyroyal","surface_form":"Pennyroyal","offset":855},{"uri":"Pennyroyal","surface_form":"Pennyroyal","offset":953},{"uri":"Oxford_English_Dictionary","surface_form":"Oxford English Dictionary","offset":1044},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1122},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French language","offset":1222}]}
