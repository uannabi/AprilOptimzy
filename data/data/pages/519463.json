{"id":519463,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology","text":"Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. Algebraic topology can be used in a number of other fields such as physics, branches of geometry and number theory.\nAlgebraic topology can be used to count \"holes\" in a shape: for example, a wedding ring and a hollow pipe both have one hole, but a figure-8 has two. This can also be done in different dimensions; a hollow sphere has a kind of \"2-dimensional\" hole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":34},{"uri":"Abstract_algebra","surface_form":"abstract algebra","offset":67},{"uri":"Topological_space","surface_form":"topological space","offset":93},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":180},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":201},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":214},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":435}]}
