{"id":519618,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigrapha","text":"=\"preserve\">Pseudepigrapha (pseudo = false; graphe = writing) are falsely attributed works. They are written works not by their supposed author.\nThey include Old Testament works not included in the Bible. They were a group of early writings which were not included in the Bible, or the Apocrypha. Most were falsely ascribed to biblical characters.\nThese are Jewish religious works thought to be written about 300 BC to 300 AD. They are distinguished by Protestants from the deuterocanonical (Catholic and Orthodox) or Apocrypha (Protestant). These books appear in the Septuagint and Vulgate but not in the Hebrew Bible or in Protestant bibles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":137},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":158},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":198},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"Apocrypha","offset":286},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":358},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":413},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":423},{"uri":"Protestants","surface_form":"Protestants","offset":453},{"uri":"Deuterocanonical_books","surface_form":"deuterocanonical","offset":474},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":492},{"uri":"Orthodox","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":505},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"Apocrypha","offset":518},{"uri":"Septuagint","surface_form":"Septuagint","offset":568},{"uri":"Vulgate","surface_form":"Vulgate","offset":583},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":606}]}
