{"id":519620,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)","text":"In civil proceedings and criminal prosecutions under the common law, a defendant may raise a defense (or defence) in an attempt to avoid criminal or civil liability. It is an answer, made by a defendant to a plaintiff's action or a denial of a prosecutor's charges. It is also an answer in equity.\nCriminal defenses.\nMany of the above are considered an affirmative defense in which case the burden of proof may be on the defendant to prove their innocence. Otherwise in a criminal trial the burden of proof usually rests with the prosecution. They must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civil_law","surface_form":"civil proceeding","offset":3},{"uri":"Criminal_law","surface_form":"criminal prosecution","offset":25},{"uri":"Common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":57},{"uri":"Defendant","surface_form":"defendant","offset":71},{"uri":"Legal_liability","surface_form":"liability","offset":155},{"uri":"Defendant","surface_form":"defendant","offset":193},{"uri":"Plaintiff","surface_form":"plaintiff","offset":208},{"uri":"Prosecutor","surface_form":"prosecutor","offset":244},{"uri":"Equity_(law)","surface_form":"equity","offset":290},{"uri":"Affirmative_defense","surface_form":"affirmative defense","offset":353},{"uri":"Legal_burden_of_proof","surface_form":"burden of proof","offset":391},{"uri":"Prosecution","surface_form":"prosecution","offset":530},{"uri":"Reasonable_doubt","surface_form":"reasonable doubt","offset":592}]}
