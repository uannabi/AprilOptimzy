He served as Prime Minister of Japan from 1946 to 1947 and from 1948 to 1954.\nHe was the Ambassador to England in 1936. By 1939 he had fallen out of favor with the government. He was against the military expansion Japan was engaged in at the time. All he felt he could do was retire. He was later imprisoned for these same views. When General Douglas MacArthur became the military governor of Japan, Yoshida was called to Tokyo to become the new foreign minister.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":60},{"uri":"Diplomat","surface_form":"diplomat","offset":69},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"Ambassador","offset":183},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":197},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":258},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":289},{"uri":"Expansion","surface_form":"expansion","offset":298},{"uri":"Retirement","surface_form":"retire","offset":370},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"General","offset":429},{"uri":"Douglas_MacArthur","surface_form":"Douglas MacArthur","offset":437},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":475},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":516},{"uri":"Foreign_minister","surface_form":"foreign minister","offset":540}]}
