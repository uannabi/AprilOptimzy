{"id":519830,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Dalton","text":"Andrew Gregory Dalton (born October 29, 1987) is an American football quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU). In his final college game, the 2011 Rose Bowl against the Wisconsin Badgers, Dalton led the Horned Frogs to a 21\u201319 victory. He left the TCU program as its all-time leader in wins. He also holds several statistical passing records.\nDalton was selected by the Bengals in the second round (35th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year, $5.2 million contract. Under a West Coast-style offensive scheme, Dalton and receiver A.J. Green, the Bengals' 2011 first-round selection from the University of Georgia, have become a great quarterback/receiver combination. Dalton and Green broke NFL records for completions (completed passes) and yards for a rookie quarterback/receiver combination.\nDalton is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to have thrown for over 3,000 yards in each of his first three seasons. The others are Cam Newton, Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, and Russell Wilson. Dalton is also one of five to have passed for at least 20 touchdowns in each of his first three seasons. He joins Manning, Luck, Wilson, and Dan Marino. Dalton is the only quarterback to lead the Cincinnati Bengals to four consecutive Playoffs. He is just one of five quarterbacks to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons. He is also the Bengals franchise record holder for passing yards and touchdowns in a season.\nDue to his red hair, Dalton has been nicknamed \"The Red Rifle\" by Bengals fans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"American football","offset":52},{"uri":"Quarterback","surface_form":"quarterback","offset":70},{"uri":"Cincinnati_Bengals","surface_form":"Cincinnati Bengals","offset":90},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":116},{"uri":"College_football","surface_form":"college football","offset":158},{"uri":"Texas_Christian_University","surface_form":"Texas Christian University","offset":178},{"uri":"Rose_Bowl","surface_form":"Rose Bowl","offset":248},{"uri":"University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison","surface_form":"Wisconsin Badgers","offset":270},{"uri":"Texas_Christian_University","surface_form":"Horned Frogs","offset":304},{"uri":"NFL_Draft","surface_form":"NFL Draft","offset":526},{"uri":"USD","surface_form":"$","offset":560},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":565},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":573},{"uri":"West_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"West Coast","offset":591},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"offensive scheme","offset":608},{"uri":"Wide_receiver","surface_form":"receiver","offset":637},{"uri":"A.J._Green","surface_form":"A.J.
