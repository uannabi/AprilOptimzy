The show, which started in 1964 as \"Recollections\", has been the longest running program on WAMU. The show ranks first in its timeslot, and its audience is \"remarkably young for a public radio crowd.\" Walker was blind.\nWalker died in Rockville, Maryland from cancer, aged 83.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":53},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":85},{"uri":"WAMU","surface_form":"WAMU-FM","offset":178},{"uri":"Gunsmoke","surface_form":"Gunsmoke","offset":254},{"uri":"The_Jack_Benny_Show","surface_form":"The Jack Benny Show","offset":266},{"uri":"The_Lone_Ranger","surface_form":"The Lone Ranger","offset":289},{"uri":"Fibber_McGee_and_Molly","surface_form":"Fibber McGee and Molly","offset":308},{"uri":"Superman","surface_form":"Superman","offset":338},{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blind","offset":671},{"uri":"Rockville%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Rockville, Maryland","offset":693},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":718}]}
