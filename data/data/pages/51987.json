He wrote about many topics, and influenced many other thinkers.\nFoucault studied institutions such as psychiatric wards, hospitals, schools, and prisons, to figure out how they affected the people living in them. He was gay. He also studied the history of sexuality and, later in his life, wrote about homosexuality.\nHe is often called a postmodernist or post-structuralist philosopher. Some philosophers claim that some of his ideas were influenced by existentialism. However, Foucault rejected all of these labels.\nEarly life.\nFoucault was born in 1926 in Poitiers, France. His father, Paul Foucault, was a surgeon. He attended the Jesuit Coll\u00E8ge Saint-Stanislas. After World War II Foucault studied at the \u00C9cole Normale Sup\u00E9rieure.

In the mid-1950s, he worked at Warsaw University and at the University of Hamburg.\nHe returned to France in 1960 to become a philosophy professor at the University of Clermont-Ferrand. In the mid-1960s, Foucault moved with his lover to Tunis (in North Africa), and got a job teaching at the University of Tunis. In 1966 he published \"Les Mots et les choses\" (The Order of Things), which was very popular. In 1968 he returned to France, where he published \"L'arch\u00E9ologie du savoir\" (The Archaeology of Knowledge).\nIn the late 1960s, after France had huge student protests and riots, the French government created a new experimental university at Vincennes. Foucault became the first head of its philosophy department. Foucault joined students in occupying administration buildings and fighting with police.\nIn 1970, Foucault became a Professor of the History of Systems of Thought at the Coll\u00E8ge de France.
