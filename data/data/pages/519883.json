{"id":519883,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction","text":"An injunction is a court order that either commands or prevents a party from doing a specific act.\nUS law.\nInjunctions can be temporary or permanent. A restraining order and a preliminary injunction are examples of temporary injunctions. Either may be issued early in a lawsuit to prevent either party from doing anything that might unfairly influence the outcome of the litigation. A permanent injunction is usually issued after a case is settled. It enforces the final decision of the court.\nAustralian apprehended violence orders.\nIn the state of New South Wales, an apprehended violence order (AVO) may be issued against a person from whom another person fears violence. They can be issued to prevent physical abuse, harassment or stalking. Any person who violates an AVO may be charged with a criminal offence.\nUK injunctions and super-injunctions.\nWhile the United Kingdom has injunctions much the same as other countries they also have super-injunctions. This is an injunction (sometimes called a gag-order) that prevents journalists from writing anything about a court case. It also prevents them from reporting that the injunction itself has been issued. If any injunction in the UK prevents details of the order from being known it is also called a super-injunction.\nAnti-suit injunctions.\nIn common law countries anti-suit injunctions are court orders used to prevent a court or tribunal from assuming jurisdiction or taking over an ongoing lawsuit. An anti-suit injunction may also be used to prevent a party from filing a second lawsuit in another jurisdiction at the same time as the first case.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Court_order","surface_form":"court order","offset":19},{"uri":"Command","surface_form":"command","offset":43},{"uri":"Prevent","surface_form":"prevent","offset":55},{"uri":"Temporary","surface_form":"temporary","offset":126},{"uri":"Permanent","surface_form":"permanent","offset":139},{"uri":"Restraining_order","surface_form":"restraining order","offset":152},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":203},{"uri":"Lawsuit","surface_form":"lawsuit","offset":270},{"uri":"Litigation","surface_form":"litigation","offset":371},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":487},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":550},{"uri":"Physical_abuse","surface_form":"physical abuse","offset":705},{"uri":"Harass","surface_form":"harass","offset":721},{"uri":"Stalking","surface_form":"stalking","offset":735},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"criminal","offset":798},{"uri":"Offence","surface_form":"offence","offset":807},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":864},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":918},{"uri":"Gag-order","surface_form":"gag-order","offset":1004},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"journalist","offset":1029},{"uri":"Court_case","surface_form":"court case","offset":1071},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":1189},{"uri":"Common_law_countries","surface_form":"common law countries","offset":1303},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":1413}]}
