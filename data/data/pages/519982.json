The series is centered on the fictional Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a pastiche of pizza restaurants such as Chuck E. Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza Place.\nIn the first three games in the series, the player controls a nighttime security guard, who must utilize security cameras and other tools to survive against animatronic characters which become mobile and homicidal after hours. The fourth game in the series takes place in the house of a child who must defend against nightmarish versions of the animatronics. The fifth game, \"Sister Location\", is set in a maintenance facility owned by a sister company of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and sees the player character as a technician who must complete different tasks each night. In the sixth game, \"Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator\", the player assumes the role of a new owner of the pizzeria.\nA horror attraction based on the series was featured in the Adventuredome for Halloween 2016, and a film adaptation is planned. The series appeared in the \"Guinness Book of Records: Gamer's Edition\", setting a record for the largest number of sequels released in a year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
