{"id":519990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_interest","text":"e=\"preserve\">A security interest is a legal claim on collateral. The collateral can be real estate, personal property or any asset. Collateral is usually used to secure a loan.\nThe borrower is the party who borrows the funds. The lender is the one who lends the money in return for a security interest. The lender can repossess the asset if the borrower fails to repay the loan. The lender can then sell the asset to repay the loan. A loan secured by collateral is called a \"secured loan\" (also called a lien). A loan with no collateral (such as a credit card) is an unsecured loan. There is nothing for the lender to repossess.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":38},{"uri":"Claim","surface_form":"claim","offset":44},{"uri":"Collateral_(finance)","surface_form":"collateral","offset":53},{"uri":"Real_estate","surface_form":"real estate","offset":87},{"uri":"Personal_property","surface_form":"personal property","offset":100},{"uri":"Asset","surface_form":"asset","offset":125},{"uri":"Loan","surface_form":"loan","offset":171},{"uri":"Borrow","surface_form":"borrow","offset":181},{"uri":"Lend","surface_form":"lend","offset":230},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":262},{"uri":"Repossession","surface_form":"repossess","offset":318},{"uri":"Lien","surface_form":"lien","offset":504}]}
