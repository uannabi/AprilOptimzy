{"id":52022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_bridge","text":"A suspension bridge is a type of bridge that has been made since ancient times as early as 100 AD. Some simple suspension bridges, for use by pedestrians and livestock, are still constructed, based upon the ancient Inca rope bridge.\nSuspended from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads.\nThe design of the modern suspended-deck suspension bridge was developed in the early 19th century. It can cross a longer span than other kinds of bridges.\nThe Akashi Kaiky\u014D Bridge is the world's longest suspension bridge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":33},{"uri":"Pedestrian","surface_form":"pedestrian","offset":142},{"uri":"Inca_rope_bridge","surface_form":"Inca rope bridge","offset":215},{"uri":"Canyon","surface_form":"canyon","offset":283},{"uri":"Akashi_Kaiky%C5%8D_Bridge","surface_form":"Akashi Kaiky\u014D Bridge","offset":557}]}
