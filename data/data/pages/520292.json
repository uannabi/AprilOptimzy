The power station is open to visitors. Around 50,000 tourists visit it each year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity","surface_form":"pumped-storage","offset":65},{"uri":"Hydroelectricity","surface_form":"hydroelectric","offset":80},{"uri":"Argyll_and_Bute","surface_form":"Argyll and Bute","offset":111},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":128},{"uri":"Turbine","surface_form":"turbine","offset":142},{"uri":"Ben_Cruachan","surface_form":"Ben Cruachan","offset":173},{"uri":"Cruachan_Reservoir","surface_form":"Cruachan Reservoir","offset":211},{"uri":"Loch_Awe","surface_form":"Loch Awe","offset":233},{"uri":"Power_stations","surface_form":"power stations","offset":305},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":327},{"uri":"Black_start","surface_form":"black start","offset":360},{"uri":"National_Grid_(Great_Britain)","surface_form":"National Grid","offset":390},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"Construction","offset":405},{"uri":"Hunterston_A_nuclear_power_station","surface_form":"Hunterston A nuclear power station","offset":456},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":559},{"uri":"Generator","surface_form":"generated","offset":571}]}
