{"id":520308,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe_Geoglyphs","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Steppe Geoglyphs are a number of Neolithic earth constructions in the Turgay Trough area of Turgai in northern Kazakhstan. There are at least 260 of these earthworks.\nMany or all of them are smaller earthworks (mounds, trenches and ramparts) arranged with each other to make geometric and other shapes (composite figures). These shapes are squares, rings and three others. The composite figures range from slightly under 90 m in length to over 400 m in diameter.\nBesides being made of earth dug out and piled up, some of the geoglyphs are made by placing stones next to each other.\nSome of the large shapes have been given names, including Bestamskoe Ring, Ushtogaysky (\"or\" Ushtogay) Square, Turgay triradial swastika, Large cross Ashtasti, Ekedyn cross, Ashutasti ring, Kyzyloba line, Koga cross, and Shili square.\nOptical dating (optically stimulated luminescence) was used to get a date for these structures. The results indicate that they date between eight and one thousand years ago.\nThe earthworks were discovered in 2007 by Dimitriy Dey. He found them when he was looking at Google Earth. He had been looking for pyramids or similar structures in Kazakhstan. The geoglyphs were first reported to the scientific community in 2014.\nRoad construction in 2013 damaged one of the structures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":50},{"uri":"Turgay_Trough","surface_form":"Turgay Trough","offset":87},{"uri":"Turgai","surface_form":"Turgai","offset":109},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":128},{"uri":"Earthworks","surface_form":"earthworks","offset":172},{"uri":"Optically_stimulated_luminescence","surface_form":"optically stimulated luminescence","offset":850},{"uri":"Google_Earth","surface_form":"Google Earth","offset":1101}]}
