{"id":520353,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_poetry","text":"The earliest known English poem is a hymn on the creation. Bede says this was by C\u00E6dmon (flourished 658\u2013680). He was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced poetry at a monastery at Whitby. This is probably the earliest written Anglo-Saxon poetry we have.\nMuch of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically. Estimates for the date of the great epic \"Beowulf\" range from AD 608 through to AD 1000, and there has never been agreement.\nIt is possible to identify some key moments. \"The Dream of the Rood\" was written before about AD 700, when parts were carved in runes on the Ruthwell Cross. Some poems on historical events, such as \"The Battle of Brunanburh\" (937) and \"The Battle of Maldon\" (991), seem to have been written shortly after the events, so they can be dated reasonably precisely.\nAnglo-Saxon poetry is known by the manuscripts in which it survives. The most important manuscripts are from the late 10th and early 11th centuries. They are known as the C\u00E6dmon manuscript, the Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and the Beowulf manuscript.\n\"Beowulf\" is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase.\nWith one notable exception (the so-called \"Rhyming Poem\"), Anglo-Saxon poetry depends on alliteration for its structure. Any rhyme included is just ornamental.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":27},{"uri":"Hymn","surface_form":"hymn","offset":37},{"uri":"Creation","surface_form":"creation","offset":49},{"uri":"Bede","surface_form":"Bede","offset":59},{"uri":"C%C3%A6dmon","surface_form":"C\u00E6dmon","offset":81},{"uri":"Illiterate","surface_form":"illiterate","offset":142},{"uri":"Herdsman","surface_form":"herdsman","offset":153},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":175},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastery","offset":187},{"uri":"Whitby","surface_form":"Whitby","offset":200},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"written","offset":238},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":246},{"uri":"Epic","surface_form":"epic","offset":401},{"uri":"Beowulf","surface_form":"Beowulf","offset":407},{"uri":"The_Dream_of_the_Rood","surface_form":"The Dream of the Rood","offset":536},{"uri":"Runes","surface_form":"runes","offset":618},{"uri":"Ruthwell_Cross","surface_form":"Ruthwell Cross","offset":631},{"uri":"Battle_of_Brunanburh","surface_form":"The Battle of Brunanburh","offset":689},{"uri":"The_Battle_of_Maldon","surface_form":"The Battle of Maldon","offset":726},{"uri":"Manuscripts","surface_form":"manuscripts","offset":885},{"uri":"C%C3%A6dmon_manuscript","surface_form":"C\u00E6dmon manuscript","offset":1021},{"uri":"Vercelli_Book","surface_form":"Vercelli Book","offset":1044},{"uri":"Exeter_Book","surface_form":"Exeter Book","offset":1063},{"uri":"Nowell_Codex","surface_form":"Beowulf manuscript","offset":1084},{"uri":"Alliteration","surface_form":"alliteration","offset":1415},{"uri":"Rhyme","surface_form":"rhyme","offset":1451},{"uri":"Ornamental","surface_form":"ornamental","offset":1474}]}
