{"id":52066,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_(color)","text":"Azure is a color that looks like the color of the sky on a bright, clear day. It is a pure chroma on the RGB color wheel halfway between blue and cyan. The complementary color of azure is orange.\nWhere the name comes from.\nThe word \"azure\" comes from the Persian \u0644\u0627\u0698\u0648\u0631\u062F \"lazhward\". Lazhward was the name of a place. This place was famous for a kind of deep blue stone. Now we call this stone \"lapis lazuli\". This means \"stone of Lazhward\".\nThe word came to Old French by the twelfth century. The French used this word to talk about the colors of coats of arms. From the French the word came to the English. The first recorded use of \"azure\" as a color name in English was in 1374.\nHeraldry.\nIn heraldry, the word \"azure\" simply means \"blue\". Azure is said to represent Jupiter and sapphires.\nIt belongs to the class of tinctures called \"colors\". In engraving, it is sometimes depicted as a region of horizontal lines or else marked with either az. or b. as an abbreviation.\nIn addition to the standard blue tincture called azure, there is a lighter blue sometimes found that is called bleu celeste or \"sky blue\". Neither azure nor bleu celeste is precisely defined as a particular shade of blue, but azure is consistently depicted in a much darker shade.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":11},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":50},{"uri":"Chroma","surface_form":"chroma","offset":91},{"uri":"Light-emitting_diode","surface_form":"RGB","offset":105},{"uri":"Color_wheel","surface_form":"color wheel","offset":109},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":137},{"uri":"Cyan","surface_form":"cyan","offset":146},{"uri":"Complementary_color","surface_form":"complementary color","offset":156},{"uri":"Orange_(color)","surface_form":"orange","offset":188},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":255},{"uri":"Lapis_lazuli","surface_form":"lapis lazuli","offset":393},{"uri":"Old_French","surface_form":"Old French","offset":457},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"coats of arms","offset":546},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":570},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":598},{"uri":"1374","surface_form":"1374","offset":675},{"uri":"Heraldry","surface_form":"heraldry","offset":694},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":735},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":769},{"uri":"Sapphire","surface_form":"sapphire","offset":781},{"uri":"Tincture_(heraldry)","surface_form":"tinctures","offset":819},{"uri":"Engraving","surface_form":"engraving","offset":849},{"uri":"Bleu_celeste","surface_form":"bleu celeste","offset":1085}]}
