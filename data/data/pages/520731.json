To help progress, the G8 finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55\u00A0billion in debt owed by poor countries. This was to allow them to use resources for improving health, education and reducing poverty.\nDeveloped countries' aid for the MDGs rose during the period. More than half went for debt relief. Much of the rest went towards natural disaster relief and military aid, instead of development.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"G8","surface_form":"G8","offset":92},{"uri":"World_Bank","surface_form":"World Bank","offset":164},{"uri":"International_Monetary_Fund","surface_form":"International Monetary Fund","offset":180},{"uri":"African_Development_Bank","surface_form":"African Development Bank","offset":222},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":275},{"uri":"Debt","surface_form":"debt","offset":286},{"uri":"Natural_disaster","surface_form":"natural disaster","offset":538}]}
