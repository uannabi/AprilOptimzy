The winner of the UEFA Champions League plays against the winner of the UEFA Europa League. It is played in the middle of August.\nHistory.\nThe UEFA Super Cup started in 1972, with the winner of the Champions Cup playing against the winner of the European Cup Winners' Cup. It was not recognized by UEFA because it had a team that was banned from UEFA competitions, Rangers F.C.. Since there was no stadium chosen to host the game, they played one match at one team's stadium, and one match at the other's. In 1973, the first Super Cup final to be recognized by UEFA was played between Ajax and Milan. On aggregate (the added score from the 2 matches), Ajax won 6-1.\nIn 1991, the UEFA Super Cup between Manchester United and Red Star Belgrade was only played at Old Trafford (Manchester United's stadium) because of the war in Yugoslavia. In 1992, the Champions Cup was renamed the UEFA Champions League. In 1995, the European Cup Winners' Cup was renamed the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. The tournament was made the same. In 1998, the tournament was made 1 match with a host stadium. In 1999, The Cup Winners' Cup was ended by UEFA. The last Super Cup to be played with the winner of the Cup Winners' Cup was between Manchester United, winners of the Champions League, and Lazio, the winners of the last ever Cup Winners' Cup. Lazio won 1-0. In the year 2000, the Cup Winners' Cup was replaced in the Super Cup by the UEFA Cup. The first match to be played this way was between Real Madrid, the winners of the Champions League, and Galatasaray S.K., winners of the UEFA Cup. Galatasaray won 2-1.\nIn 2009, the UEFA Cup was renamed the UEFA Europa League. The tournament stayed the same.\nTrophy.\nThe UEFA Super Cup trophy is with UEFA at all times. A replica trophy is given to the winning club. Forty gold medals are given to the winning club and forty silver medals to the runners-up.\nThe Super Cup trophy has went through several changes in its history. The first trophy was presented to Ajax in 1973. In 1977, the original trophy was replaced by a plaque with a gold UEFA emblem. In 1987, the next trophy was the smallest and lightest of all the European club trophies, weighing 5 kg (11 lb) and measuring 42.5 cm (16.7 in) in height. The new model, which is a larger version of the previous trophy, was introduced in 2006 and weighs 12.2 kg (27 lb) and measures 58 cm (23 in) in height.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UEFA","surface_form":"UEFA","offset":43},{"uri":"UEFA_Champions_League","surface_form":"UEFA Champions League","offset":92},{"uri":"UEFA_Europa_League","surface_form":"UEFA Europa League","offset":146},{"uri":"UEFA_Cup_Winners%27_Cup","surface_form":"European Cup Winners' Cup","offset":320},{"uri":"Rangers_F.C.","surface_form":"Rangers F.C.","offset":439},{"uri":"A.F.C._Ajax","surface_form":"Ajax","offset":659},{"uri":"A.C._Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":668},{"uri":"Manchester_United","surface_form":"Manchester United","offset":776},{"uri":"Red_Star_Belgrade","surface_form":"Red Star Belgrade","offset":798},{"uri":"Old_Trafford","surface_form":"Old Trafford","offset":835},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":900},{"uri":"S.S._Lazio","surface_form":"Lazio","offset":1341},{"uri":"Real_Madrid_C.F.","surface_form":"Real Madrid","offset":1546},{"uri":"Galatasaray_S.K.","surface_form":"Galatasaray S.K.","offset":1600}]}
