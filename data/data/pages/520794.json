It was done when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont. The album has since been released on iTunes and has attained a new wave of popularity as a result of Sanders' ongoing presidential campaign.\nBackground.\nIn 1987, Burlington-based musician Todd Lockwood was sipping coffee at Leunig's Bistro when he came up with the idea to ask the city's mayor, Bernie Sanders, to record a musical project at his studio, White Crow Audio. Lockwood called the mayor's office and left Sanders a message with a secretary. Sanders later called back to set up a meeting, where he told Lockwood \"I have to admit to you this appeals to my ego.\"\nSanders made a list of ten songs he would be willing to record, five of which made the cut for the album.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":35},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":71},{"uri":"Burlington%2C_Vermont","surface_form":"Burlington, Vermont","offset":128},{"uri":"ITunes","surface_form":"iTunes","offset":186},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign%2C_2016","surface_form":"presidential campaign","offset":267},{"uri":"Burlington%2C_Vermont","surface_form":"Burlington","offset":311},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":444}]}
