{"id":521109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing","text":"e=\"preserve\">Genome editing is a type of genetic engineering.\nDNA is inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases, or \"molecular scissors\". The nucleases make specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired places in the genome. The cell\u2019s own mechanisms repair the induced break(s) by natural processes.\nAt present there are four families of engineered nucleases being used.\nGenome editing was chosen by Nature Methods as the 2011 Method of the Year. The technique is already being used, but implanting modified embryos into a woman is not yet permitted.\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 method.\nIn 2017 this system was announced as one of the biggest scientific achievements of the year. Cas9 is an enzyme which with a guide RNA, can put a new sequence of DNA into a genome. Sir John Skehel said \"That might allow you to knock out a particular gene in a cell, or introduce a particular gene, or correct a particular mutated gene that you want to work better\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genetic_engineering","surface_form":"genetic engineering","offset":41},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":62},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":107},{"uri":"Nuclease","surface_form":"nuclease","offset":144},{"uri":"Nature_(journal)","surface_form":"Nature Methods","offset":445},{"uri":"Embryos","surface_form":"embryos","offset":553},{"uri":"CRISPR","surface_form":"CRISPR","offset":600},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":724},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":750},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":781},{"uri":"John_Skehel","surface_form":"John Skehel","offset":804}]}
