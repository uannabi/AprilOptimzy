{"id":521202,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle","text":"Skeletal muscle is a form of \"striated\" (striped) muscle tissue. It is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers known as tendons. It is one of three muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle.\nSkeletal muscle is made up of individual muscle cells or myocytes, known as \"muscle fibres\". Muscle fibres do the work when muscles contract. A great deal is known about their structure and how they work. They contract when they get a nerve impulse.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Muscle_tissue","surface_form":"muscle tissue","offset":50},{"uri":"Somatic_nervous_system","surface_form":"somatic nervous system","offset":106},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":168},{"uri":"Collagen","surface_form":"collagen","offset":188},{"uri":"Tendons","surface_form":"tendons","offset":213},{"uri":"Cardiac_muscle","surface_form":"cardiac muscle","offset":272},{"uri":"Smooth_muscle","surface_form":"smooth muscle","offset":291},{"uri":"Myocyte","surface_form":"myocyte","offset":363},{"uri":"Nerve_impulse","surface_form":"nerve impulse","offset":541}]}
