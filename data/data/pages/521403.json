{"id":521403,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_AV-8B_Harrier_II","text":"The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a single-engine ground-attack aircraft. It is the second generation of the Harrier Jump Jet family. It is capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL). The aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. It can hover like a helicopter but can also fly like a jet at near supersonic speeds. It is named after the a bird of prey. It is primarily used on light attack or multi-role missions. These range from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B is used by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military. Another is the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.\nThe project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s. It was a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK). it was aimed at working on solving the problems of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to improve the Harrier's performance. The UK dropped out of the project in 1975.\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft uses a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic changes. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar. This resulted in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but was not built. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":64},{"uri":"Ground-attack_aircraft","surface_form":"ground-attack aircraft","offset":71},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":112},{"uri":"Harrier_Jump_Jet","surface_form":"Harrier Jump Jet","offset":130},{"uri":"V/STOL","surface_form":"vertical or short takeoff and landing","offset":172},{"uri":"Anglosphere","surface_form":"Anglo-American","offset":270},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":304},{"uri":"Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier","surface_form":"Hawker Siddeley Harrier","offset":312},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":366},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":396},{"uri":"Supersonic","surface_form":"supersonic","offset":443},{"uri":"Harrier_(bird)","surface_form":"a bird of prey","offset":484},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":530},{"uri":"Combat_mission","surface_form":"missions","offset":551},{"uri":"Close_air_support","surface_form":"close air support","offset":578},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"troops","offset":606},{"uri":"Reconnaissance_aircraft","surface_form":"reconnaissance","offset":622},{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"United States Marine Corps","offset":663},{"uri":"Spanish_Navy","surface_form":"Spanish Navy","offset":702},{"uri":"Italian_Navy","surface_form":"Italian Navy","offset":724},{"uri":"British_Aerospace_Harrier_II","surface_form":"British Aerospace Harrier II","offset":766},{"uri":"Trainer_(aircraft)","surface_form":"trainer","offset":883},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1016},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1034},{"uri":"Rolls-Royce_Pegasus","surface_form":"Pegasus engine","offset":1186},{"uri":"McDonnell_Douglas","surface_form":"McDonnell Douglas","offset":1318},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":1485},{"uri":"Cockpit","surface_form":"cockpit","offset":1503},{"uri":"Fuselage","surface_form":"fuselage","offset":1525},{"uri":"Hardpoint","surface_form":"hardpoint","offset":1545},{"uri":"Aerodynamic","surface_form":"aerodynamic","offset":1590},{"uri":"Maiden_flight","surface_form":"maiden flight","offset":1738},{"uri":"Night-attack","surface_form":"night-attack","offset":1843},{"uri":"Radar","surface_form":"radar","offset":1871},{"uri":"British_Aerospace","surface_form":"British Aerospace","offset":2041},{"uri":"Boeing","surface_form":"Boeing","offset":2159},{"uri":"BAE_Systems","surface_form":"BAE Systems","offset":2170}]}
