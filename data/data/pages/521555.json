{"id":521555,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tup%C3%AD_people","text":"The Tup\u00ED people were an important ethnic group of indigenous peoples in Brazil. Scholars believe they first settled in the Amazon rainforest. Later, they started to move to the south and settled on the Atlantic coast.\nHistory.\nThe Tup\u00ED people were living in almost all of the Brazilian coast when the Portuguese first arrived there. In 1500, their population was estimated to be 1 million people. They were divided into tribes, each tribe numbering from 300 to 2,000 people. Some of these tribes are: \"Tupiniquim\", \"Tupinamb\u00E1\", \"Potiguara\", \"Tabajara\", \"Caet\u00E9s\", \"Temimin\u00F3\", \"Tamoios\".\nThe Tup\u00ED had agriculture. They grew cassava, corn, sweet potatoes, beans, peanuts, tobacco, squash, cotton and many other crops.\nEuropean colonization.\nAfter the 16th century, the Tup\u00ED were assimilated, made to work as slaves, or killed by diseases such as smallpox or by Portuguese settlers and Bandeirantes (colonial Brazilian scouts). Except for a few communities, nearly all the Tup\u00ED were killed. Today, the descendants of the survivors live on Indian reservations or are part of the dominant Brazilian society.\nCannibalism.\nThe Tup\u00ED were divided into several tribes which would constantly engage in war with each other. In these wars, the Tup\u00ED would try to capture their enemies to later kill and eat them.\nThey believed that they would gain the strength of the warriors they eat. The Tup\u00ED also ate the remains of dead relatives.\nCannibalism by the Tup\u00ED decreased after European contact and religious intervention. When Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador, arrived in Santa Catarina in 1541, for instance, he attempted to ban cannibalism.\nSome scholars question whether the Tup\u00ED actually engaged in cannibalism. They do not think the sources that talk about cannibalism, mostly written by Europeans, are reliable.\nRace-mixing and \"Cunhadismo\".\nIn the 16th century, the Tupi were the first group to have contact with the Portuguese. The Portuguese colonists did not bring many women, so miscegenation between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women started. The Tupi had a tradition, called \"Cunhadismo\", of incorporating strangers to their community. The Indians offered the Portuguese an Indian girl as wife. Once he agreed, he formed a bond of kinship with all the Indians of the tribe. The settlers also adopted the Indian practice of polygyny.\nThe relatives of an Indian woman would have to work for her husband. If a settler had many Indian wives, he would have a large number of Indian relatives who would have to work for him. They would mostly have to cut wood and take it to the ships on the coast. Since there were not a lot of Portuguese women in Brazil, intermarriage made it easier for the Portuguese to colonize the country.\nInfluence in Brazil.\nAlthough most of the Tup\u00ED population died, a large population with Tup\u00ED-Portuguese ancestry occupied much of Brazilian territory. They continued the ancient Tup\u00ED traditions in several points of the country. Darcy Ribeiro wrote that the first Brazilians looked more like the Tup\u00ED than the Portuguese. The language that they spoke, called Nheengatu or L\u00EDngua Geral, was based on Tup\u00ED.\nEventually, Brazilian society started to lose its Tupi characteristics. L\u00EDngua Geral was replaced by the Portuguese language. Indian ways of making things were replaced by European ones. Brazilian Portuguese absorbed many words from Tupi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil","surface_form":"indigenous peoples in Brazil","offset":50},{"uri":"Amazon_rainforest","surface_form":"Amazon rainforest","offset":123},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":301},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":420},{"uri":"Tupiniquim_people","surface_form":"Tupiniquim","offset":502},{"uri":"Tupinamb%C3%A1_people","surface_form":"Tupinamb\u00E1","offset":516},{"uri":"Potiguara","surface_form":"Potiguara","offset":529},{"uri":"Tabajara","surface_form":"Tabajara","offset":542},{"uri":"Caet%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Caet\u00E9s","offset":554},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":599},{"uri":"Cassava","surface_form":"cassava","offset":622},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"corn","offset":631},{"uri":"Sweet_potato","surface_form":"sweet potato","offset":637},{"uri":"Bean","surface_form":"bean","offset":653},{"uri":"Peanut","surface_form":"peanut","offset":660},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":669},{"uri":"Squash_(plant)","surface_form":"squash","offset":678},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":686},{"uri":"Cultural_assimilation","surface_form":"assimilated","offset":776},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":805},{"uri":"Smallpox","surface_form":"smallpox","offset":843},{"uri":"Bandeirantes","surface_form":"Bandeirantes","offset":882},{"uri":"Colonial_Brazil","surface_form":"colonial Brazil","offset":896},{"uri":"Reconnaissance","surface_form":"scouts","offset":915},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"communities","offset":941},{"uri":"Indian_reservation","surface_form":"Indian reservation","offset":1035},{"uri":"Warrior","surface_form":"warrior","offset":1353},{"uri":"%C3%81lvar_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_Cabeza_de_Vaca","surface_form":"Cabeza de Vaca","offset":1511},{"uri":"Conquistador","surface_form":"conquistador","offset":1537},{"uri":"Santa_Catarina_Island","surface_form":"Santa Catarina","offset":1562},{"uri":"Miscegenation","surface_form":"miscegenation","offset":1980},{"uri":"Polygyny","surface_form":"polygyny","offset":2333},{"uri":"Darcy_Ribeiro","surface_form":"Darcy Ribeiro","offset":2962},{"uri":"Nheengatu_language","surface_form":"Nheengatu","offset":3092},{"uri":"L%C3%ADngua_Geral","surface_form":"L\u00EDngua Geral","offset":3105},{"uri":"Brazilian_Portuguese","surface_form":"Brazilian Portuguese","offset":3325}]}
