This journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (\u2033World Health Culture Organization\u2033) received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of Culture of Health, holistic medicine, and Buddhism.\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the New Age.\nSkumin's doctrine of the culture of health.\nIn 1968, when Skumin was still a medical student, he proposed the term \u2033culture of health\u2033 (Russian: \u2033\u041A\u0443\u043B\u044C\u0442\u0443\u0301\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0434\u043E\u0440\u043E\u0301\u0432\u044C\u044F\u2033), which has become widespread. The main task of the culture of health is to do health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual well-being.\nThe 'culture of health' means recognizing health\u2019s central importance in life. Skumin referred to the works of Helena Blavatsky, Helena and Nicholas Roerich, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Alexander Chizhevsky. In some of his publications, he argues that the culture of health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society in the Solar System.\nThe doctrine of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture \u2013 spiritual, mental, and physical \u2013 determines the status of human health. And health \u2013 spiritual, mental, physical \u2013 is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.\nSkumin syndrome.\n\"Skumin syndrome\" () was described by Skumin in 1978 as a \"cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome\", associated with mechanical heart valve implant and manifested by irrational fear, anxiety, depression and sleep disorder. This syndrome is often accompanied by asthenia.\nAlain Carpentier \u2013 a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the head the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the H\u00F4pital Europ\u00E9en Georges-Pompidou in Paris \u2013 believed in 2011 that Skumin syndrome develops in a quarter of the patients with an artificial heart valve. It is possible that a similar problem arises in the conduct of operations to implement an artificial heart.\nSkumin mind control method.\nIn 1979, Skumin created a special modification of mind control method for psychological rehabilitation of patients. This method is based on autogenic training. Autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz. He emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. It is a method for influencing one's autonomic nervous system. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures.\nThe technique of the Skumin mind control method (Russian: \"\u041F\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043E\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0301\u043D\u0438\u043D\u0433 \u043F\u043E \u0421\u043A\u0443\u0301\u043C\u0438\u043D\u0443\") involves the use of two standard postures: sitting meditation and lying down meditation. This method of psychotraining includes five psychological exercises: the first is \"the relaxation\", the second one is \"the warming\", the third one is \"the zero gravity\", the fourth one is \"the target autosuggestion\", and the fifth exercise is \"the psychological activation\". Each session contain explanation of the theory and practice of each new exercise as it is reached. The therapeutic effect is achieved by the neutralization of traumatic emotional experiences and the progressive reorganization of the psychic structures to include previously unacceptable mental contents, too. This method of psychotherapy has found application in medical practice, in particular in the treatment of phobias, headaches, etc.\nSkumin\u2019s mixture.\nSkumin proposed mixture subsequently named after him. \"Skumin\u2019s mixture\" () is a medicine with a sedative effect, affecting the central nervous system. It is used to treat Skumin syndrome, light forms of heart failure, anxiety and sleep disorders, and asthenia. The medicine is known to be well tolerated, with no contra-indications, except sensitivity. The formula contains Adonis vernalis, Crataegus, Valerian root, Leonurus cardiaca, Eucalyptus, Peppermint, and Rose hip.\nHis works.\nSkumin wrote many books and articles on a variety medical and spiritual topics advocating a holistic approach to health. He is the author or co-author of a series illustrated books on the culture of health, yoga, Roerich\u2019s philosophy, and Buddhism.\nSkumin was important in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism. Today Theravada Buddhists, who are also known as Theravadins, number over 100 million worldwide; in recent decades Theravada has begun to take root in the West and in the Buddhist revival in Nepal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russian","offset":55},{"uri":"Psychologist","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":63},{"uri":"Psychiatrist","surface_form":"psychiatrist","offset":77},{"uri":"Psychotherapy","surface_form":"psychotherapist","offset":91},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"medical
