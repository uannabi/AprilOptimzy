{"id":521756,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_retirement_account","text":"An individual retirement account or IRA is a form of \"individual retirement plan\". It is simply a savings account with large tax advantages. An IRA is not itself an investment. It is where an investor keeps assets such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. A 401(k) is set up by an employer, but an IRA may be started by an individual. Other IRAs may be opened by small business owners and those who are self-employed.\nTypes of IRAs.\nThere are different types of IRAs: Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP-IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs. They vary as to tax filing status. Also they have different rules and conditions.\nParticipant-directed accounts.\nA participant-directed account (also called a self-directed IRA) is an IRA which is provided by some financial institutions in the United States. It allows alternative investments for retirement savings. Some examples of such alternative investments are: real estate, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas limited partnerships, precious metals, horses, and intellectual property. There is a risk of fraud when investing in Self-Directed retirement accounts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pension","surface_form":"\"individual retirement plan\"","offset":53},{"uri":"Savings_account","surface_form":"savings account","offset":98},{"uri":"Tax_advantage","surface_form":"tax advantage","offset":125},{"uri":"Asset","surface_form":"asset","offset":207},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"stock","offset":222},{"uri":"Bond","surface_form":"bond","offset":230},{"uri":"Mutual_fund","surface_form":"mutual fund","offset":240},{"uri":"401(k)","surface_form":"401(k)","offset":256},{"uri":"Employer","surface_form":"employer","offset":279},{"uri":"Small_business","surface_form":"small business","offset":361},{"uri":"Ownership","surface_form":"owners","offset":376},{"uri":"Self-employment","surface_form":"self-employed","offset":401},{"uri":"Status","surface_form":"status","offset":548},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":581},{"uri":"Condition","surface_form":"condition","offset":591},{"uri":"Financial_institution","surface_form":"financial institution","offset":735},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":765},{"uri":"Alternative","surface_form":"alternative","offset":790},{"uri":"Investment","surface_form":"investment","offset":802},{"uri":"Real_estate","surface_form":"real estate","offset":889},{"uri":"Mortgage","surface_form":"private mortgages","offset":902},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"private company stock","offset":921},{"uri":"Partnership","surface_form":"limited partnerships","offset":956},{"uri":"Precious_metal","surface_form":"precious metal","offset":978},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":995},{"uri":"Intellectual_property","surface_form":"intellectual property","offset":1007},{"uri":"Fraud","surface_form":"fraud","offset":1049}]}
