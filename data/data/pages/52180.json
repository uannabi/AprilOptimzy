{"id":52180,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason","text":"e=\"preserve\">Jason was a hero in Greek mythology. He was born in Thessaly, northern Greece. Jason was the captain of the ship called the \"Argos\". The men who helped to sail the boat were called the Argonauts. The word Argonaut comes from the name of the boat: Argo and the word ending -naut meaning \"sailor\".\nJason and the Argonauts went to find the Golden Fleece. His father was Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcus. Jason fell in love with the daughter of the Golden Fleece's owner. Her name was Medea. Medea helped Jason get the Golden Fleece from her father. Jason and Medea killed the owner of the Golden Fleece and returned to Jason's city, Iolcus. Medea then killed Jason's half-brother Pelias so Jason could be in charge. When she was found out, Jason and Medea went to live in the Greek city of Corinth. Jason then married the princess of Corinth so they could stay. The story of Jason, the Argonauts, and the Golden Fleece is told in two modern movies: \"Hercules\" starring Steve Reeves, and \"Jason and the Argonauts\" starring Todd Armstrong.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":25},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":33},{"uri":"Thessaly","surface_form":"Thessaly","offset":65},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":84},{"uri":"Argos_(mythology)","surface_form":"Argos","offset":138},{"uri":"Argonaut","surface_form":"Argonaut","offset":198},{"uri":"Golden_Fleece","surface_form":"Golden Fleece","offset":350},{"uri":"Aeson","surface_form":"Aeson","offset":380},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":400},{"uri":"Iolcus","surface_form":"Iolcus","offset":408},{"uri":"Medea","surface_form":"Medea","offset":496},{"uri":"Corinth","surface_form":"Corinth","offset":802},{"uri":"Hercules_(1958_movie)","surface_form":"Hercules","offset":962},{"uri":"Steve_Reeves","surface_form":"Steve Reeves","offset":981},{"uri":"Jason_and_the_Argonauts_(1963_movie)","surface_form":"Jason and the Argonauts","offset":1000}]}
