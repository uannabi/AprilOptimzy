{"id":521866,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadi_John","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mohammed Emwazi (born Muhammad Jassim Abdulkarim Olayan al-Dhafiri, 17 August 1988 \u2013 12 November 2015) was a Kuwaiti-born British Arab terrorist. He moved to London in 1994. He was thought to be the person seen in several videos produced by the Islamic extremist group ISIL. The videos showed the beheadings of captives in 2014 and 2015. A group of his hostages nicknamed him \"Jihadi John\" since he was part of a four-person terrorist cell with British accents whom they called \"The Beatles\".\nOn the night of 12 November 2015, US officials reported that Emwazi had been hit by a drone strike in Al-Raqqah, Syria. The following day, UK officials stated a \u201Chigh degree of certainty\u201D that Emwazi was killed. He was declared dead later that day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kuwait","surface_form":"Kuwait","offset":122},{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":135},{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":143},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":148},{"uri":"Islamic_extremist","surface_form":"Islamic extremist","offset":258},{"uri":"Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","surface_form":"ISIL","offset":282},{"uri":"Beheading","surface_form":"beheading","offset":310},{"uri":"Captive","surface_form":"captive","offset":324},{"uri":"Hostage","surface_form":"hostage","offset":366},{"uri":"Accent","surface_form":"accent","offset":466},{"uri":"The_Beatles_(terrorist_cell)","surface_form":"\"The Beatles\"","offset":491},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":540},{"uri":"Drone_strike","surface_form":"drone strike","offset":592},{"uri":"Al-Raqqah","surface_form":"Al-Raqqah","offset":608},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":619},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":645}]}
