{"id":522,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_reasoning","text":"=\"preserve\">Moral reasoning is a topic studied in psychology and in moral philosophy. It studies how people think about moral issues, problems, and questions. Psychologists who have studied it include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel. Kohlberg said that moral understanding develops in three main stages as a person gets older, but Turiel said that there are three domains of moral understanding that develop at the same time as a person gets older.\nMoral philosophy, or ethics, is a major branch of philosophy. It is the study of value or quality. It covers the analysis and use of concepts such as right, wrong, good, evil, and responsibility.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"studied","offset":39},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":50},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":74},{"uri":"Psychologist","surface_form":"Psychologist","offset":159},{"uri":"Lawrence_Kohlberg","surface_form":"Lawrence Kohlberg","offset":201},{"uri":"Moral","surface_form":"moral","offset":257},{"uri":"Ethics","surface_form":"ethics","offset":474},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":503},{"uri":"Philosophical_analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":566},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":586},{"uri":"Wrong","surface_form":"wrong","offset":610},{"uri":"Good_(philosophy)","surface_form":"good","offset":617},{"uri":"Evil","surface_form":"evil","offset":623},{"uri":"Moral_responsibility","surface_form":"responsibility","offset":633}]}
