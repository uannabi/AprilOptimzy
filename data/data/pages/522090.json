It was released on 23 October 2015. The song was Adele's first since the Bond theme \"Skyfall\" in 2012. The song reached number one in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States. In the US, it first appeared at the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Adele's fourth chart-topper there and spending ten weeks on top of the chart. It sold over 1,112,000 copies in its first week. This is the most copies of a song sold in a single week in the U.S. since the release of Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind 1997\". \"Hello\" was certified 4\u00D7 Platinum in the U.S. faster than any other song in history. On September 20, 2016, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the song 7\u00D7 Platinum for sales and streams equal to 7 million copies in the United States.\nThe song finished at number 35 on the Year-End \"Billboard\" Hot 100 of 2015 and at #7 on the 2016 chart. Similarly, the song ranked at number 25 on the Canadian 2015 year-end chart and at number 9 at the end of 2016.\n\"Hello\" won three awards at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in 2017: Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance.\nMusic video.\nThe music video was shot in Canada. It was shot in sepia. It shows Adele having a conversation on a flip phone when she suddenly loses reception. Her feelings towards a man are throughout the video.
