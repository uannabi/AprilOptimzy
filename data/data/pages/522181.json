{"id":522181,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derogation","text":"Derogation (Latin \"derogatio\") is the relaxation or exemption from of a rule of law. This is as opposed to a repeal or ending of a law. The term is used in both civil law and common law. It is sometimes used, loosely, to mean abrogation. For example in the legal maxim: \"Lex posterior derogat priori\" which means a more recent law may overrule an earlier law. Derogation is different from dispensation (an exception to a law) in that it applies to the law. A dispensation applies to specific people who are affected by the law.\nIn terms of European Union legislation, a derogation can also imply that a member state delays putting into effect a part of an European Union regulation (etc.) into their own legal system. This can be for a period of time such as five years. Or that a member state has decided not to enforce a specific provision in a treaty due to internal circumstances (typically a state of emergency).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":12},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":80},{"uri":"Repeal","surface_form":"repeal","offset":109},{"uri":"Civil_law_(legal_system)","surface_form":"civil law","offset":161},{"uri":"Common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":175},{"uri":"Abrogation","surface_form":"abrogation","offset":226},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":242},{"uri":"Dispensation_(canon_law)","surface_form":"dispensation","offset":389},{"uri":"Exception","surface_form":"exception","offset":406},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":540},{"uri":"Legislation","surface_form":"legislation","offset":555},{"uri":"Implication_and_inference","surface_form":"imply","offset":590},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":610},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":656},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"regulation","offset":671},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaty","offset":847}]}
