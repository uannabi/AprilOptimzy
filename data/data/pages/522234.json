He use brain surgery on animals, and studied their effects. His kind of surgery is called \"ablative surgery\": in most cases ablative brain surgery does not mean removing brain tissue, but rather destroying tissue and leaving it in place.\nIn 1825, Flourens pioneered the experimental method of ablating parts of the brain in living rabbits and pigeons. He carefully observed their effects. His intention was to find out whether different parts of the brain had different functions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":93},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":118},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":133},{"uri":"Physiologist","surface_form":"physiologist","offset":156},{"uri":"Anesthesia","surface_form":"anesthesia","offset":229},{"uri":"Brain_surgery","surface_form":"brain surgery","offset":248}]}
