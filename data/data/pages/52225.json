{"id":52225,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil","text":"e=\"preserve\">An anvil is a hard piece of metal which is used as a workbench when making things out of iron or steel. An anvil is used by a blacksmith when he needs to hammer hot iron to bend it into the shape he wants. A blacksmith can make new shoes for horses.\nAnvils were known in the Bronze Age and possibly earlier. They were used in Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt. They are still in use today, although not nearly as much as 100 years ago when there were many more horses.\nAnvils are extremely heavy. They are made in different sizes. The 17th century writer John Bunyan was a tinker (someone who mends pots and pans). He walked around the villages of Bedfordshire with a small anvil and a few tools on his back. His anvil was wedge-shaped, so that he could knock it into the ground when he needed to do a repair. His anvil is now in the John Bunyan museum in Bedford.\nUse as a musical instrument.\nThe anvil has sometimes been used as a percussion instrument because it makes a very loud sound when hit by the hammer. Usually musicians use a metal bar mounted on a sound-box. This sounds just as good as a real anvil (which would be very heavy to carry around).\nVerdi wrote some famous music called the \"Anvil Chorus\" in his opera \"Il Trovatore\". Wagner asked for 18 anvils in \"Das Rheingold\" in the scene which takes place below the earth where the Nibelungs are working at their forges. Albert Parlow wrote an \"Anvil Polka\", Var\u00E8se used an anvil in \"Ionisation\", Walton uses an anvil in \"Belshazzar\u2019s Feast\" and there is an anvil in the orchestra in Howard Shore's music for \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":41},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":102},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":110},{"uri":"Blacksmith","surface_form":"blacksmith","offset":139},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":167},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":255},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":288},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":339},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":358},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":547},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":560},{"uri":"John_Bunyan","surface_form":"John Bunyan","offset":567},{"uri":"Bedfordshire","surface_form":"Bedfordshire","offset":660},{"uri":"Bedford_(England)","surface_form":"Bedford","offset":868},{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion instrument","offset":945},{"uri":"Giuseppe_Verdi","surface_form":"Verdi","offset":1170},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":1233},{"uri":"Il_Trovatore","surface_form":"Il Trovatore","offset":1240},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Wagner","offset":1255},{"uri":"Das_Rheingold","surface_form":"Das Rheingold","offset":1286},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":1342},{"uri":"Forge","surface_form":"forge","offset":1389},{"uri":"Albert_Parlow","surface_form":"Albert Parlow","offset":1397},{"uri":"Edgar_Var%C3%A8se","surface_form":"Var\u00E8se","offset":1435},{"uri":"Ionisation","surface_form":"Ionisation","offset":1460},{"uri":"William_Walton","surface_form":"Walton","offset":1473},{"uri":"Belshazzar%E2%80%99s_Feast","surface_form":"Belshazzar\u2019s Feast","offset":1498},{"uri":"Howard_Shore","surface_form":"Howard Shore","offset":1560},{"uri":"The_Lord_of_the_Rings_movie_trilogy","surface_form":"\"The Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy","offset":1585}]}
