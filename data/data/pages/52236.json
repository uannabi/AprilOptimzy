{"id":52236,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_tape","text":"Duct tape, sometimes called duck tape, is a very strong adhesive tape with a cloth backing. Usually duct tape is grey or black, but it is made in other colors including transparent, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, flames, zebra stripe, leopard spot, tye dye, and others. People use duct tape to repair many things, for example a broken handbag or a broken chair.\nDuct tape was designed during World War I. It was first used to keep water out of ammunition cases. It was found to work so well that people started using it to fix many other things. Duct tape was also called \"100 mph tape\" by the military because it is said the tape will still stick in winds at speeds of 100 miles per hour. Duct tape got its name from its use on heating and air conditioning ducts but oddly enough, that is the one use that the tape is not very good for. It is illegal in California to use duct tape on ducts and most professional builders in the United States are not allowed to use it either.\nIn the United States, people use duct tape in many action movies and television shows. Strips of duct tape can be used to tie a person up because it is very hard to get them off.\nDuct tape is also great for making things like wallets, purses, clothes, and sometimes even sculptures. The use of it as an art medium is fairly new, though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adhesive_tape","surface_form":"adhesive tape","offset":56},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":77},{"uri":"Grey","surface_form":"grey","offset":113},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":121},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":152},{"uri":"Transparent","surface_form":"transparent","offset":169},{"uri":"Handbag","surface_form":"handbag","offset":346},{"uri":"Chair","surface_form":"chair","offset":366},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":403},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammunition","offset":455},{"uri":"Mph","surface_form":"mph","offset":588},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":605},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":662},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":740},{"uri":"Air_conditioning","surface_form":"air conditioning","offset":752},{"uri":"Duct","surface_form":"duct","offset":769},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":855},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":866},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":912},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":941},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":996},{"uri":"Action","surface_form":"action","offset":1040},{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":1047},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television shows","offset":1058}]}
