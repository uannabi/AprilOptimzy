{"id":522550,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)","text":"Battery is the intentional and offensive or harmful contact with another person. The exact definition varies by jurisdiction. In criminal law the elements of battery are physical contact that causes harm or offensive contact without that person's consent. Battery is often confused with assault which is threatening battery. Battery is when the threat (assault) is carried out and the person is harmed in some way. Criminal battery and civil battery may be the same or differ slightly depending on jurisdiction. In many cases the act of battery can result in both criminal and civil liability.\nCivil vs Criminal battery.\nCivil battery is a tort. It is a wrong committed against another person that results in damage. It is also called an intentional tort. In most cases they are the result of negligence, caused by carelessness or recklessness. The person on whom the battery was committed, the victim, may bring a lawsuit in court to collect monetary damages.\nIf all four elements can be proved, a \"prima facie\" case exists to go ahead and prosecute the offender.\nIn most cases the civil lawsuit follows a criminal trial. A person found not-guilty in a criminal trial does not prevent the victim from filing a civil suit. The burden of proof is usually lower in a civil court than in a criminal court.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Offensive","surface_form":"offensive","offset":31},{"uri":"Harmful","surface_form":"harmful","offset":44},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":112},{"uri":"Criminal_law","surface_form":"criminal law","offset":129},{"uri":"Assault","surface_form":"assault","offset":287},{"uri":"Battery_(tort)","surface_form":"civil battery","offset":436},{"uri":"Liability","surface_form":"liability","offset":583},{"uri":"Tort","surface_form":"tort","offset":640},{"uri":"Intentional_tort","surface_form":"intentional tort","offset":738},{"uri":"Negligence","surface_form":"negligence","offset":793},{"uri":"Carelessness","surface_form":"carelessness","offset":815},{"uri":"Recklessness","surface_form":"recklessness","offset":831},{"uri":"Victim","surface_form":"victim","offset":895},{"uri":"Lawsuit","surface_form":"lawsuit","offset":915},{"uri":"Damages","surface_form":"damages","offset":952},{"uri":"Prima_facie","surface_form":"prima facie","offset":1000},{"uri":"Legal_case","surface_form":"case","offset":1013},{"uri":"Offender","surface_form":"offender","offset":1055},{"uri":"Acquittal","surface_form":"not-guilty","offset":1138},{"uri":"Burden_of_proof","surface_form":"burden of proof","offset":1227}]}
