{"id":522672,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Nuremberg principles were a set of guidelines for determining what constitutes a war crime. The document was created by the International Law Commission of the United Nations to codify the legal principles underlying the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi party members following World War II.\nPrinciple I.\n\"Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefor and liable to punishment.\"\nPrinciple II.\n\"The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law.\"\nPrinciple III.\n\"The fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law acted as Head of State or responsible government official does not relieve him from responsibility under international law.\"\nPrinciple IV.\n\"The fact that a person acted pursuant to (an) order of his government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him\".\nBefore the time of the Nuremberg Trials, this defense was called \"Superior Orders\". After the Nuremberg Trials, that defense is now referred to by many as the \"Nuremberg Defense\". More recently a third term, \"lawful orders\", has been used for the same defense.\nPrinciple V.\n\"Any person charged with a crime under international law has the right to a fair trial on the facts and law.\"\nPrinciple VII.\n\"Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Guideline","surface_form":"guideline","offset":52},{"uri":"Determining","surface_form":"determining","offset":67},{"uri":"War_crime","surface_form":"war crime","offset":98},{"uri":"International_Law_Commission","surface_form":"International Law Commission","offset":141},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":177},{"uri":"Codification_(law)","surface_form":"codify","offset":195},{"uri":"Nuremberg_Trials","surface_form":"Nuremberg Trials","offset":238},{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":258},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":287},{"uri":"Constitute","surface_form":"constitute","offset":351},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":365},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":377},{"uri":"Liable","surface_form":"liable","offset":423},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":433},{"uri":"Impose","surface_form":"impose","offset":497},{"uri":"Penalty","surface_form":"penalty","offset":506},{"uri":"Responsibility","surface_form":"responsibility","offset":630},{"uri":"Head_of_State","surface_form":"Head of State","offset":790},{"uri":"Responsible_government","surface_form":"responsible government","offset":807},{"uri":"Official","surface_form":"official","offset":830},{"uri":"Pursuant","surface_form":"pursuant","offset":950},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":980},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"moral choice","offset":1085},{"uri":"Nuremberg_Trials","surface_form":"Nuremberg Trials","offset":1151},{"uri":"Defense","surface_form":"defense","offset":1174},{"uri":"Superior_Orders","surface_form":"Superior Orders","offset":1194},{"uri":"Nuremberg_Defense","surface_form":"Nuremberg Defense","offset":1288},{"uri":"Lawful_orders","surface_form":"lawful orders","offset":1337},{"uri":"Right_to_a_fair_trial","surface_form":"right to a fair trial","offset":1467},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1506}]}
