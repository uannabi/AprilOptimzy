{"id":522675,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In law, codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction. They are listed, usually by subject, forming a legal code (a codex or book of law). Codification is the defining feature of civil law jurisdictions.\nHistory.\nAncient Sumer's Code of Ur-Nammu was compiled 2100-2050 BC. It is the earliest known surviving civil code. Three centuries later, the Babylonian king Hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him.\nReligious laws such as the Torah were codified. Important codifications were developed in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the Lex Duodecim Tabularum. Much later the Corpus Iuris Civilis was assembled. These codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule. During much of ancient history the Roman laws were left mostly uncodified.\nThe first \"permanent\" system of codified laws could be found in China. This was with the compilation of the \"Tang Code\" in AD 624. This formed the basis of the Chinese criminal code. This was then replaced by the \"Great Qing Legal Code\". This code was in turn abolished in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China. The new laws of the Republic of China were inspired by the German codified work, the \"B\u00FCrgerliches Gesetzbuch\". A very influential example in Europe was the French Napoleonic code of 1804.\nAnother early system of laws is Hindu law framed by Manu and called as Manu Smriti. They date back to the 2nd century BC. The use of civil codes in Islamic Sharia law began with the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century AD.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":16},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":41},{"uri":"Collect","surface_form":"collect","offset":52},{"uri":"Stating","surface_form":"restating","offset":67},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":90},{"uri":"List","surface_form":"list","offset":113},{"uri":"Subject","surface_form":"subject","offset":132},{"uri":"Legal_code","surface_form":"legal code","offset":151},{"uri":"Codex","surface_form":"codex","offset":165},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":174},{"uri":"Civil_law_(legal_system)","surface_form":"civil law","offset":228},{"uri":"Sumer","surface_form":"Sumer","offset":270},{"uri":"Code_of_Ur-Nammu","surface_form":"Code of Ur-Nammu","offset":278},{"uri":"Compile","surface_form":"compile","offset":299},{"uri":"Civil_code","surface_form":"civil code","offset":357},{"uri":"Babylonia","surface_form":"Babylonia","offset":396},{"uri":"Hammurabi","surface_form":"Hammurabi","offset":412},{"uri":"Code_of_Hammurabi","surface_form":"set of laws named after him","offset":434},{"uri":"Torah","surface_form":"Torah","offset":490},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":565},{"uri":"Twelve_Tables","surface_form":"Lex Duodecim Tabularum","offset":608},{"uri":"Corpus_Iuris_Civilis","surface_form":"Corpus Iuris Civilis","offset":647},{"uri":"Exception","surface_form":"exception","offset":712},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient history","offset":760},{"uri":"Roman_law","surface_form":"Roman law","offset":780},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":884},{"uri":"Tang_Code","surface_form":"Tang Code","offset":929},{"uri":"Criminal_law","surface_form":"criminal code","offset":988},{"uri":"Great_Qing_Legal_Code","surface_form":"Great Qing Legal Code","offset":1034},{"uri":"Xinhai_Revolution","surface_form":"Xinhai Revolution","offset":1112},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":1159},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":1237},{"uri":"B%C3%BCrgerliches_Gesetzbuch","surface_form":"B\u00FCrgerliches Gesetzbuch","offset":1264},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1320},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":1335},{"uri":"Napoleonic_code","surface_form":"Napoleonic code","offset":1342},{"uri":"Hindu_law","surface_form":"Hindu law","offset":1399},{"uri":"Manu_Smriti","surface_form":"Manu Smriti","offset":1438},{"uri":"2nd_century_BC","surface_form":"2nd century BC","offset":1473},{"uri":"Civil_law","surface_form":"civil codes","offset":1500},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1515},{"uri":"Sharia","surface_form":"Sharia","offset":1523},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":1549},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":1571},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":1584}]}
