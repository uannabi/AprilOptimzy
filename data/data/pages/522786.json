{"id":522786,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tull","text":"Walter Daniel John Tull (28 April 1888 \u2013 25 March 1918) was an English professional footballer. He played as an inside forward for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton Town. He was the second person of mixed race to play in the top division of the Football League. He was the first mixed-race British outfielder in the top division of English football. His professional football career began after he was spotted while playing for his local amateur club, Clapton F.C.. He began playing for Clapton in 1908. Within a few months he had won winners' medals in the FA Amateur Cup, London County Amateur Cup and London Senior Cup. In March 1909 the \"Football Star\" called him \"the catch of the season\".\nTull was brought up in a National Children's Home orphanage in Bethnal Green, London, along with his brother. They were placed there following the death of their parents. He joined Tottenham in 1909 and transferred to Northampton Town in 1911, where he made 111\u00A0first-team appearances.\nDuring the First World War, Tull served in the Footballers' Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. He fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Tull was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 30 May 1917. This was in spite of the fact there was a ban on black people being given that status.\nTull fought in Italy in 1917\u201318. He was noted for his \"gallantry and coolness\" while leading his company of 26\u00A0men on a raiding party into enemy territory. He returned to France in 1918. Tull was killed in action on 25 March during the Spring Offensive. His body was never recovered.\nCampaigners have called for a statue to be erected in his honour. Northampton South MP Brian Binley has campaigned for Tull to be posthumously awarded the Military Cross. He was honoured with a commemorative plaque in London placed close to where he lived. A Walter Tull commemorative coin is part of a set of \u00A35 coins released by the Royal Mint.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":63},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"footballer","offset":84},{"uri":"Player","surface_form":"played","offset":99},{"uri":"Forward","surface_form":"inside forward","offset":112},{"uri":"Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.","surface_form":"Tottenham Hotspur","offset":131},{"uri":"Northampton_Town_F.C.","surface_form":"Northampton Town","offset":153},{"uri":"Mixed_race","surface_form":"mixed race","offset":199},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"Football League","offset":245},{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":290},{"uri":"Outfielder","surface_form":"outfielder","offset":298},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":354},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":376},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":438},{"uri":"Clapton_F.C.","surface_form":"Clapton F.C.","offset":452},{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"medal","offset":544},{"uri":"FA_Amateur_Cup","surface_form":"FA Amateur Cup","offset":558},{"uri":"London_Senior_Cup","surface_form":"London Senior Cup","offset":604},{"uri":"Orphanage","surface_form":"National Children's Home","offset":720},{"uri":"Orphanage","surface_form":"orphanage","offset":745},{"uri":"Bethnal_Green","surface_form":"Bethnal Green","offset":758},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":773},{"uri":"Parent","surface_form":"parent","offset":857},{"uri":"Transfer","surface_form":"transfer","offset":898},{"uri":"Appearance","surface_form":"appearance","offset":968},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":992},{"uri":"Footballers%27_Battalion","surface_form":"Footballers' Battalion","offset":1028},{"uri":"Middlesex_Regiment","surface_form":"Middlesex Regiment","offset":1058},{"uri":"Battle_of_the_Somme","surface_form":"Battle of the Somme","offset":1095},{"uri":"Commission","surface_form":"commission","offset":1133},{"uri":"Lieutenant","surface_form":"Second Lieutenant","offset":1151},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":1234},{"uri":"Social_status","surface_form":"status","offset":1264},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1287},{"uri":"Company_(military)","surface_form":"company","offset":1369},{"uri":"Raid","surface_form":"raiding party","offset":1392},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemy","offset":1411},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":1417},{"uri":"Western_Front_(World_War_I)","surface_form":"France","offset":1443},{"uri":"Killed_in_action","surface_form":"killed in action","offset":1468},{"uri":"Spring_Offensive","surface_form":"Spring Offensive","offset":1508},{"uri":"Recover","surface_form":"recover","offset":1545},{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"Campaign","offset":1556},{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statue","offset":1586},{"uri":"Northampton_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","surface_form":"Northampton South","offset":1622},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"MP","offset":1640},{"uri":"Brian_Binley","surface_form":"Brian Binley","offset":1643},{"uri":"Posthumously","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":1686},{"uri":"Award","surface_form":"award","offset":1699},{"uri":"Military_Cross","surface_form":"Military Cross","offset":1711},{"uri":"Commemorative_plaque","surface_form":"commemorative plaque","offset":1750},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1774},{"uri":"Coin","surface_form":"commemorative coin","offset":1827},{"uri":"Royal_Mint","surface_form":"Royal Mint","offset":1891}]}
