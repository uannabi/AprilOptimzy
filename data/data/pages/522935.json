His works combine Byzantine tradition and Italian Renaissance influences.\nDeath.\nShpataraku was beheaded by the Ottomans in Elbasan. His family took his body and buried him in his village with his head apart from the rest of the body, so the Ottomans could not find his exact grave. A small chapel was built later to commemorate him. He is also commemorated as a saint by the locals, on September 21.\nLegacy.\nMany of his icons are in Ardenica Monastery, St. Jovan Vladimir's Church near Elbasan, Vithkuq, and in the \"Museum of Medieval Art\" in Korce. Many of his works belong to private collections.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Albania","surface_form":"Albania","offset":49},{"uri":"Shpat_(region)","surface_form":"Shpat region","offset":150},{"uri":"Elbasan","surface_form":"Elbasan","offset":225},{"uri":"Albania","surface_form":"Albania","offset":234},{"uri":"Gjinar","surface_form":"Gjinar","offset":254},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":289},{"uri":"Byzantine_church","surface_form":"Byzantine church","offset":375},{"uri":"Italian_Renaissance","surface_form":"Italian Renaissance","offset":474},{"uri":"Ardenica_Monastery","surface_form":"Ardenica Monastery","offset":866},{"uri":"St._Jovan_Vladimir%27s_Church","surface_form":"St. Jovan Vladimir's Church","offset":886},{"uri":"Elbasan","surface_form":"Elbasan","offset":919},{"uri":"Vithkuq","surface_form":"Vithkuq","offset":928},{"uri":"Korce","surface_form":"Korce","offset":976}]}
