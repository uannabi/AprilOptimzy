{"id":523022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_username","text":"=\"preserve\">A wasted username or wasted account is a user account on a website that was not used very much (or at all) after it was made. A person who makes an account like this is called a namewaster or a name waster.\nThis word came from YouTube, where many people would post both funny and hateful comments on namewasters' YouTube channels. This was an Internet phenomenon until 2012, when YouTube deleted a lot of these wasted accounts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"User_(computing)","surface_form":"user account","offset":53},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":71},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":239},{"uri":"Internet_meme","surface_form":"Internet phenomenon","offset":355}]}
