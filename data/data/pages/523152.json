{"id":523152,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad","text":"Wayanad district is the 12th District in the state of Kerala in India. Mananthavady, Sulthanbathery, and Vythiri Taluks are all in Wayanad. The name Wayanad comes from Vayal Nadu and it means the land of paddy fields. It is a high, flat land between 700 meters and 2100 meters above sea level. It is in northeaster Kerala, in the Western Ghat mountains. It is next to the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Wayanad is about 885.92.km2 forest. Most of the people in Wayanad live in tribes. There are also many Nature Resorts in Wayanad for the travelers with great natural view points with silent atmosphere. Wayandad is one of the biggest foreign exchange earners in Kerala because it makes money-earning crops like pepper, cardamom, coffee, tea, and other spices.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times the Vedar Rajas ruled Wayanad. Later the Pazhassi Raja of the Kottayam Royal Dynasty ruled. Then there was a Mysorean invasion. Later, the British took over India, which lasted for 200 years. The British fought the Pazhassi Rajah. When the state of Kerala started in 1956, Wayanad was part of the Cannannore district. In 1957, south Wayanad was added to Kozhikode district and north Wayanad stayed with Cannannore district. Today's Wayanad was made by putting north Wayanad and south Wayanad together. This happened on November 1, 1980.\nPeople.\nMany Adivasi people live in Wayanad. They are Paniyas, Kurumas, Adiyars, Kurichyas, Ooralis, Kadans, and Kattunaikkans. These are the areas aboriginal tribes, meaning they lived there before other people came to Wayanad. Most of the Kurichyar own small pieces of land, but most of the members of other tribes are labourers and work for other people. Wayanad has the highest Adivasi population of any district in the state, at about 36%. Over the past thirty or forty years, these people have become marginialized, meaning life has become harder for them as other groups of people take more control of the area.\nMany settlers also live in Wayanad. People came to Wayanad from almost all the other parts of Kerala because the farmland is good. Wayanad has a small Jain community made of Gowders who came from Karnataka. They built temples all over the district. There are also many different kinds of Christians living in Wayanad. One fourth of the population of Wayanad is Christian. Another fourth of the population is Muslims, and the rest of the people are Hindus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala","offset":54},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":64},{"uri":"Paddy_field","surface_form":"paddy field","offset":204},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"high, flat land","offset":226},{"uri":"Cash_crop","surface_form":"money-earning crops","offset":692},{"uri":"Jain","surface_form":"Jain","offset":2099},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindus","offset":2396}]}
