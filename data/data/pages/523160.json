It is celebrated on the 20th of November each year.\nBackground.\nOn the 14th of December 1954, the United Nations General Assembly recommended that countries celebrate a Universal Children's Day. The date 20 November marks the day on which the assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. On 20 November 1959 they adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nAccording to UNICEF millions of children in the world are victims of violence every year. In addition to violence, these children are subject to abuse, neglect and exploitation. This is at home, at work, at school and in the community. It also takes place during wars and natural disasters. Many forms of abuse including corporal punishment and sexual abuse remain legal in many countries. It also remains socially acceptable in many places.\nObservance.\nMany children around the world live in poor conditions. They do not have access to education or health care. Other children are subject to violence and child labor. Universal Children's Day is celebrated to promote the wellbeing of children everywhere.\nChildren's Rights.\nThe Declaration of the Rights of the Child and The Convention on the Rights of the Child describe children's rights. Children's rights include the right to survive and thrive, to be educated, to be free from violence and abuse, to participate and to be heard.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Annual","surface_form":"annual","offset":31},{"uri":"Celebration","surface_form":"celebration","offset":38},{"uri":"Children%27s_rights","surface_form":"children's rights","offset":53},{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","surface_form":"United Nations General Assembly","offset":170},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":219},{"uri":"Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_the_Child","surface_form":"Declaration of the Rights of the Child","offset":336},{"uri":"Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child","surface_form":"Convention on the Rights of the Child","offset":413},{"uri":"UNICEF","surface_form":"UNICEF","offset":465},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":472},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":484},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":500},{"uri":"Victim","surface_form":"victim","offset":510},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":521},{"uri":"Child_abuse","surface_form":"abuse","offset":597},{"uri":"Neglect","surface_form":"neglect","offset":604},{"uri":"Exploitation","surface_form":"exploitation","offset":616},{"uri":"Home","surface_form":"home","offset":641},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"work","offset":650},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":659},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":677},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":715},{"uri":"Natural_disaster","surface_form":"natural disaster","offset":724},{"uri":"Corporal_punishment","surface_form":"corporal punishment","offset":773},{"uri":"Sexual_abuse","surface_form":"sexual abuse","offset":797},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":817},{"uri":"Acceptance","surface_form":"socially acceptable","offset":858},{"uri":"Condition","surface_form":"condition","offset":950},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":989},{"uri":"Health_care","surface_form":"health care","offset":1002},{"uri":"Child_labor","surface_form":"child labor","offset":1058},{"uri":"Wellbeing","surface_form":"wellbeing","offset":1125},{"uri":"Survive","surface_form":"survive","offset":1334},{"uri":"Thrive","surface_form":"thrive","offset":1346},{"uri":"Participate","surface_form":"participate","offset":1409}]}
