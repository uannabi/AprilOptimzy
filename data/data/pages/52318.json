The city has been defended with walls since the foundation of the Deva Victrix fort on the site in 79.\nHistory.\nThe first walls were built to help the Roman fort in 79, although these were replaced by stronger stone walls between the 1st and 3rd century. The walls enclosed a far smaller area than the modern walls, with the south-western corner much farther from the River Dee.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Defensive_wall","surface_form":"defensive wall","offset":38},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":74},{"uri":"Chester","surface_form":"Chester","offset":90},{"uri":"Deva_Victrix","surface_form":"Deva Victrix","offset":165},{"uri":"Roman_fort","surface_form":"fort","offset":178},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":250},{"uri":"Fort","surface_form":"fort","offset":256},{"uri":"1st_century","surface_form":"1st","offset":333},{"uri":"3rd_century","surface_form":"3rd century","offset":341},{"uri":"River_Dee%2C_Wales","surface_form":"River Dee","offset":467}]}
