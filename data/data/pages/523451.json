He was a member of the cabinet of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. As U.S. Attorney General, he was a known figure in the Watergate Scandal, and resigned rather than obey President Nixon's order to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox.\nRichardson served as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1970 to 1973, Secretary of Defense from January to May 1973, Attorney General from May to October 1973, and Secretary of Commerce from 1976 to 1977. That makes him one of only two individuals to have held four Cabinet positions within the United States government (the other such individual being George Shultz).\nOn December 31, 1999, Richardson died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 79.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":140},{"uri":"Gerald_Ford","surface_form":"Gerald Ford","offset":158},{"uri":"United_States_Attorney_General","surface_form":"U.S. Attorney General","offset":174},{"uri":"Watergate_Scandal","surface_form":"Watergate Scandal","offset":226},{"uri":"Saturday_Night_Massacre","surface_form":"resigned","offset":249},{"uri":"Archibald_Cox","surface_form":"Archibald Cox","offset":326},{"uri":"Secretary_of_Health%2C_Education%2C_and_Welfare","surface_form":"Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare","offset":362},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Defense","surface_form":"Secretary of Defense","offset":425},{"uri":"United_States_Attorney_General","surface_form":"Attorney General","offset":472},{"uri":"Secretary_of_Commerce","surface_form":"Secretary of Commerce","offset":519},{"uri":"Cabinet_(government)","surface_form":"Cabinet","offset":621},{"uri":"United_States_government","surface_form":"United States government","offset":650},{"uri":"George_Shultz","surface_form":"George Shultz","offset":708},{"uri":"Cerebral_hemorrhage","surface_form":"cerebral hemorrhage","offset":767},{"uri":"Boston%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Boston, Massachusetts","offset":790}]}
