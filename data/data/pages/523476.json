{"id":523476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_probability","text":"=\"preserve\">Frequency probability or Frequentism is one of the interpretations of probability theory. Repeating a scientific experiment very often gives a number of results. It is then possible, to count the number of times that a given event happened and compare it to the total number of experiments.\nThis interpretation of probabiilty was very important for statistics. People who use this interpretation are often called Frequentists. Well-known frequentists include Richard von Mises, Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, R. A. Fisher and John Venn.\nOther interpretations of probability are Bayesian probability and Axiomatic probability theory","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":82},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":361},{"uri":"Richard_von_Mises","surface_form":"Richard von Mises","offset":471},{"uri":"Egon_Pearson","surface_form":"Egon Pearson","offset":490},{"uri":"Jerzy_Neyman","surface_form":"Jerzy Neyman","offset":504},{"uri":"R._A._Fisher","surface_form":"R.
