{"id":523514,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_law","text":"e=\"preserve\">Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, notes, copyrights and patents.\nHistory.\nThe idea behind all property law is property. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch. Land ownership was through land tenure in feudal systems. The first legal right of absolute ownership was under Roman law and was called \"dominion\".\nThe Napoleonic Code was among the first government acts of modern times to introduce the notion of absolute ownership into statute. But protection of personal property rights was present in medieval Islamic law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":62},{"uri":"Real_property","surface_form":"real property","offset":87},{"uri":"Personal_property","surface_form":"personal property","offset":105},{"uri":"Civil_law_(legal_system)","surface_form":"civil law","offset":131},{"uri":"Movable_property","surface_form":"movable","offset":177},{"uri":"Immovable_property","surface_form":"immovable property","offset":189},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":285},{"uri":"Stocks","surface_form":"stocks","offset":292},{"uri":"United_States_Treasury_security","surface_form":"notes","offset":300},{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":307},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":322},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":394},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":452},{"uri":"Land_tenure","surface_form":"land tenure","offset":488},{"uri":"Feudal","surface_form":"feudal","offset":503},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":529},{"uri":"Roman_law","surface_form":"Roman law","offset":573},{"uri":"Napoleonic_Code","surface_form":"Napoleonic Code","offset":614},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":650},{"uri":"Modern_history","surface_form":"modern times","offset":669},{"uri":"Statute","surface_form":"statute","offset":733},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":800},{"uri":"Sharia","surface_form":"Islamic law","offset":809}]}
