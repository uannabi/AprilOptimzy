As debuted at Nintendo's Space World trade show in 2000, the demonstrated graphics and physics concepts were gradually incorporated into various games across many years. This includes the rapid object generation in \"Pikmin\", the \"sphere walking\" technology used in ' and \"Super Mario Galaxy\", and the physics of \"Metroid Prime\".\n\"Super Mario 64\" sequel.\nThe name \"Super Mario 128\" was first used as early as January 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto, as a possible name for a \"Super Mario 64\" sequel. This rumored expansion and sequel to \"Super Mario 64\" called \"Super Mario 64-2\" was said to be developed for the 64DD, but ended up being cancelled due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at E3's 1997 convention that he was \"just getting started\" on the project.\nIn November 1999, Shigeru Miyamoto said, \"Well, for over a year now at my desk, a prototype program of Mario and Luigi has been running on my monitor. We've been thinking about the game, and it may be something that could work on a completely new game system.\" The game had only a demo of one level made for it. Miyamoto claimed that multiplayer functionality was the first aspect of the game that he wanted to include.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Super_Mario_64","surface_form":"Super Mario 64","offset":121},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":152},{"uri":"Nintendo_Space_World","surface_form":"Space World","offset":163},{"uri":"Pikmin","surface_form":"Pikmin","offset":354},{"uri":"Super_Mario_Galaxy","surface_form":"Super Mario Galaxy","offset":410},{"uri":"Metroid_Prime","surface_form":"Metroid Prime","offset":451},{"uri":"Shigeru_Miyamoto","surface_form":"Shigeru Miyamoto","offset":562},{"uri":"64DD","surface_form":"64DD","offset":743},{"uri":"Shigeru_Miyamoto","surface_form":"Shigeru Miyamoto","offset":816},{"uri":"Electronic_Entertainment_Expo","surface_form":"E3","offset":846},{"uri":"Mario","surface_form":"Mario","offset":1021},{"uri":"Luigi","surface_form":"Luigi","offset":1031}]}
