{"id":52361,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auvergne","text":"Auvergne () is a former administrative region of France. It is now part of the administrative region of Auvergne-Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes. It is in the Massif Central in south-central France. The inhabitants of the region are known as \"Auvergnats\".\nThe four departments in Auvergne were Allier, Cantal, Haute-Loire, and Puy-de-D\u00F4me. Its capital was Clermont-Ferrand.\nHistory.\nThe region of Auvergne was named after the Arverni, one of the most powerful gallic tribes.\nThe administrative region of Auvergne was formed with the territory of the old province of Auvergne, most of the territory of the Bourbonnais and small parts of Languedoc and Lyonnais.\nDuring World War II, Vichy (a city in the department of Allier) was the headquarters of the government of the French State.\nGeography.\nThe Auvergne region has an area of, 4.8% of France's total surface area. It was surrounded by six other former regions: Burgundy to the northeast, Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes to the east and to the southeast, Languedoc-Roussillon to the south, Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es to the southwest, Limousin to the west and Centre-Val de Loire to the northwest.\nThe landscape of the region varies greatly, with valleys, mountain, meadows and forests. Much of the regions is in the Massif Central, a high region in south-central France with mountains and plateaus.\nThere are many dormant volcanoes (volcanoes that are not active) in Auvergne, mainly in the \"Monts Dore\" and in the \"Cha\u00EEne des Puys\". The highest point in Auvergne is the \"Puy de Sancy\" (), at high.\nThe northern part of the region (in the Allier department) is a land of small hills cut in two parts by a plain, the valley of the Allier river.\nAuvergne has about 50 freshwater ponds and lakes. Some are high in the mountains and have volcanic origins. The \"Gu\u00E9ry Lake\" is, at high in the Puy-de-D\u00F4me department, the highest lake in Auvergne.\nDemographics.\nThe Auvergne region had a population, in 2012, of 1,354,104, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nEconomy.\nThe region is predominantly agricultural. Cattle are common and are used both for meat (beef) and for milk, which is made into a number of well-known cheeses such as Bleu d'Auvergne, Cantal, Fourme d'Ambert and Saint-Nectaire.\nThe main industry in Auvergne is the tyre industry, represented by \"Michelin\", with headquarters and history in Clermont-Ferrand, and \"Dunlop\" in Montlu\u00E7on.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":49},{"uri":"Auvergne-Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes","surface_form":"Auvergne-Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes","offset":104},{"uri":"Massif_Central","surface_form":"Massif Central","offset":139},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":171},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":245},{"uri":"Allier","surface_form":"Allier","offset":274},{"uri":"Cantal","surface_form":"Cantal","offset":282},{"uri":"Haute-Loire","surface_form":"Haute-Loire","offset":290},{"uri":"Puy-de-D%C3%B4me","surface_form":"Puy-de-D\u00F4me","offset":307},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":324},{"uri":"Clermont-Ferrand","surface_form":"Clermont-Ferrand","offset":336},{"uri":"Arverni","surface_form":"Arverni","offset":406},{"uri":"Celts","surface_form":"gallic","offset":440},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":447},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative","offset":459},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":513},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":534},{"uri":"Auvergne_(province)","surface_form":"Auvergne","offset":546},{"uri":"Bourbonnais","surface_form":"Bourbonnais","offset":585},{"uri":"Languedoc","surface_form":"Languedoc","offset":616},{"uri":"Lyonnais","surface_form":"Lyonnais","offset":630},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":647},{"uri":"Vichy","surface_form":"Vichy","offset":661},{"uri":"Allier","surface_form":"Allier","offset":696},{"uri":"Headquarter","surface_form":"headquarter","offset":712},{"uri":"Vichy_France","surface_form":"French State","offset":750},{"uri":"Burgundy","surface_form":"Burgundy","offset":895},{"uri":"Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes","surface_form":"Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes","offset":922},{"uri":"Languedoc-Roussillon","surface_form":"Languedoc-Roussillon","offset":968},{"uri":"Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":1003},{"uri":"Limousin","surface_form":"Limousin","offset":1035},{"uri":"Centre-Val_de_Loire","surface_form":"Centre-Val de Loire","offset":1060},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":1102},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":1147},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1156},{"uri":"Meadow","surface_form":"meadow","offset":1166},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1178},{"uri":"Massif_Central","surface_form":"Massif Central","offset":1217},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":1290},{"uri":"Dormant_volcano","surface_form":"dormant volcano","offset":1315},{"uri":"Monts_Dore","surface_form":"Monts Dore","offset":1393},{"uri":"Cha%C3%AEne_des_Puys","surface_form":"Cha\u00EEne des Puys","offset":1417},{"uri":"Puy_de_Sancy","surface_form":"Puy de Sancy","offset":1473},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":1606},{"uri":"Allier_(river)","surface_form":"Allier","offset":1631},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":1667},{"uri":"Pond","surface_form":"pond","offset":1678},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":1688},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":1735},{"uri":"Puy-de-D%C3%B4me","surface_form":"Puy-de-D\u00F4me","offset":1789},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":2000},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"Cattle","offset":2014},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":2054},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":2060},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":2074},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":2122},{"uri":"Bleu_d%27Auvergne","surface_form":"Bleu d'Auvergne","offset":2138},{"uri":"Cantal_cheese","surface_form":"Cantal","offset":2155},{"uri":"Fourme_d%27Ambert","surface_form":"Fourme d'Ambert","offset":2163},{"uri":"Saint-Nectaire_(cheese)","surface_form":"Saint-Nectaire","offset":2183},{"uri":"Tire","surface_form":"tyre","offset":2236},{"uri":"Clermont-Ferrand","surface_form":"Clermont-Ferrand","offset":2311},{"uri":"Montlu%C3%A7on","surface_form":"Montlu\u00E7on","offset":2345}]}
