{"id":523840,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Mali","text":"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Mali may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. According to the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project, 98% of Malian adults do not believe that homosexuality is acceptable by society. This was one of the highest rate of non-acceptance in the 45 countries surveyed. Same-sex sexual activity is not a crime in Mali. But according to a 2013 report on Human Rights in Mali \"the law prohibits association 'for an immoral purpose'\". About 90% of Mali's population is Muslim.\nMali has long been attacked by Islamic rebels and militants. This has put gays at risk. In 2013 Islamist extremists took over the northern part of Mali. France sent 3,500 troops to help Mali. The extremists took over the town of Gao and enforced strict Sharia law. This religious law of Islam punishes gay men by execution. French troops were able to rescue two Malian men who were about to be executed for homosexuality.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"homosexuality","offset":221},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":252},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":376},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":538},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":565},{"uri":"Islamic_terrorism","surface_form":"Islamic rebels and militants","offset":577},{"uri":"Extremists","surface_form":"extremists","offset":651},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":676},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"troops","offset":717},{"uri":"Sharia_law","surface_form":"Sharia law","offset":799},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":833},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"execution","offset":859}]}
