It is native to the Congo Basin. It is one of three living species of peafowl, the other two being the Indian peafowl (originally of India and Sri Lanka) and the green peafowl (native to Burma and Indochina).\nThe Congo peacock has physical characteristics of both the peafowl and the guineafowl, which may indicate that the Congo peacock is a link between the two families.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":77},{"uri":"Peafowl","surface_form":"peafowl","offset":88},{"uri":"Congo_Basin","surface_form":"Congo Basin","offset":117},{"uri":"Indian_peafowl","surface_form":"Indian peafowl","offset":200},{"uri":"Green_peafowl","surface_form":"green peafowl","offset":259},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":284},{"uri":"Indochina","surface_form":"Indochina","offset":294},{"uri":"Guineafowl","surface_form":"guineafowl","offset":381}]}
