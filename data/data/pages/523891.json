{"id":523891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Santos","text":"S\u00E9rgio Dutra Santos (born 15 October 1975 in Diamante do Norte) is a Brazilian professional volleyball player. He is also known as Serginho or Escadinha. He plays in the libero position. In 2009 he became the first Libero to be named MVP in the World League.\nOverview.\nHe is widely regarded as one of the best liberos of all time and is unquestionably the best libero of the 2000s, with more awards than any other libero. Known for his service reception and digging skills, teams often attempted to avoid Sergio when serving.\nBeyond his defensive abilities, he was also capable of running the offense as a 'second setter' if the setter was forced to make the first contact. This was in large part due to Sergio playing the setting position while growing up and subbing in as a setter for his professional club teams over the years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diamante_do_Norte","surface_form":"Diamante do Norte","offset":45},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":69},{"uri":"Volleyball","surface_form":"volleyball","offset":92},{"uri":"Most_Valuable_Player","surface_form":"MVP","offset":234}]}
