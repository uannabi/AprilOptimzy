He is the main villain of \"The Force Awakens\", \"The Last Jedi\", and is redeemed in the final installment \"The Rise of Skywalker.\nKylo Ren is the pseudonym of Ben Solo, the son of original \"Star Wars\" trilogy characters Han Solo, who he later killed, and Leia Organa. Though trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker as a Jedi, he has been drawn to the dark side of the Force, and wants to be as powerful as his grandfather, Darth Vader who he praised and thought was the king of evil, not the one who killed the emperor. Throughout all of T\"he Force Awakens\" and the first two acts of \"The Last Jedi,\" Ren wants to be fully committed to the dark side, but there are times where the light side tries to pull him back in.

This makes him a complex character.\nKylo Ren is the master of the Knights of Ren and a commander for the First Order, an organization created from the fallen Galactic Empire.The First Order believed that the Empire's leader, Emperor Palpatine, had been killed by Luke Skywalker, not Darth Vader.
