{"id":524477,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immovable_property","text":"Immovable property is property that cannot be moved from one place to another. It is generally connected to the ground or land on which it sits. The term immovable property also includes the land.\nIn real estate law, immovable property has certain rights of ownership that go with title (full or partial) to that property. These may include rights to buildings, rights to collect rent, inherited rights, right of ways, ferries or fisheries. It generally does not include such things as grass, crops, or standing timber.\nIn much of the world's civil law systems is the same as \"real property\"; it is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface. In some countries, China for example, private ownership of land is not allowed. Individuals in China may obtain land rights for a fixed number of years for a fee. These rights may be transfered by legal means including gift or sale. They may also own houses, buildings or apartments, but not the land they sit on. In the United States immovable property is also known as real estate. In the United Kingdom it is also known as property.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"property","offset":22},{"uri":"Move","surface_form":"move","offset":46},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":122},{"uri":"Real_estate_law","surface_form":"real estate law","offset":200},{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":248},{"uri":"Ownership","surface_form":"ownership","offset":258},{"uri":"Title_(property)","surface_form":"title","offset":281},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":351},{"uri":"Renting","surface_form":"rent","offset":380},{"uri":"Inheritance","surface_form":"inherited","offset":386},{"uri":"Right_of_way","surface_form":"right of way","offset":404},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferries","offset":419},{"uri":"Fishery","surface_form":"fisheries","offset":430},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":486},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":493},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"standing timber","offset":503},{"uri":"Civil_law_(legal_system)","surface_form":"civil law","offset":543},{"uri":"Real_property","surface_form":"real property","offset":577},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":678},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":689},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":699},{"uri":"Fee","surface_form":"fee","offset":828},{"uri":"Transfer","surface_form":"transfer","offset":853},{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":867},{"uri":"Gift","surface_form":"gift","offset":889},{"uri":"Sales","surface_form":"sale","offset":897},{"uri":"Apartment","surface_form":"apartment","offset":942},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":991},{"uri":"Real_estate","surface_form":"real estate","offset":1041},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1061}]}
