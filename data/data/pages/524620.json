{"id":524620,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moeraki_Boulders","text":"The Moeraki Boulders are a rock formation in New Zealand. They are unusually large and spherical boulders on Koekohe Beach on the Otago coast, between Moeraki and Hampden. Some of the boulders are in groups, while others stand by themselves. The area has been protected in a scientific reserve.\nThe boulders sit in mudstone, which is eroded by the action of the waves along the beach. This leaves the boulders exposed on the sand.\nLocal M\u0101ori legends say the boulders as the remains of eel baskets, calabashes, and kumara washed ashore from the wreck of Arai-te-uru, a large sailing canoe. The rocks that extend seaward from Shag Point are the petrified hull of this shipwreck. A nearby rocky promontory is the body of the canoe's captain.\nIn 1848 a drawing of the beach and its boulders, shows there were more than now. This picture is now in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington. The boulders were described in 1850 colonial reports and numerous popular articles since that time. In more recent times they have become a popular tourist attraction, often described and pictured in numerous web pages and tourist guides.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_formation","surface_form":"rock formation","offset":27},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":45},{"uri":"Spherical","surface_form":"spherical","offset":87},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"boulders","offset":97},{"uri":"Otago","surface_form":"Otago","offset":130},{"uri":"Hampden%2C_New_Zealand","surface_form":"Hampden","offset":163},{"uri":"Group","surface_form":"group","offset":200},{"uri":"Mudstone","surface_form":"mudstone","offset":315},{"uri":"Eroded","surface_form":"eroded","offset":334},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":362},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":378},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":425},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":437},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":443},{"uri":"Eel_basket","surface_form":"eel basket","offset":486},{"uri":"Calabash","surface_form":"calabash","offset":499},{"uri":"Sweet_potato","surface_form":"kumara","offset":515},{"uri":"Arai-te-uru","surface_form":"Arai-te-uru","offset":554},{"uri":"Canoe","surface_form":"sailing canoe","offset":575},{"uri":"Seaward","surface_form":"seaward","offset":612},{"uri":"Petrified_wood","surface_form":"petrified","offset":644},{"uri":"Hull_(watercraft)","surface_form":"hull","offset":654},{"uri":"Shipwreck","surface_form":"shipwreck","offset":667},{"uri":"Promontory","surface_form":"promontory","offset":693},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"captain","offset":731},{"uri":"Drawing","surface_form":"drawing","offset":750},{"uri":"Alexander_Turnbull_Library","surface_form":"Alexander Turnbull Library","offset":848},{"uri":"Wellington","surface_form":"Wellington","offset":878},{"uri":"Colonial","surface_form":"colonial","offset":926},{"uri":"Report","surface_form":"report","offset":935},{"uri":"Articles","surface_form":"articles","offset":964},{"uri":"Tourist_attraction","surface_form":"tourist attraction","offset":1038},{"uri":"Web_page","surface_form":"web page","offset":1099}]}
