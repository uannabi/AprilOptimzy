His only peer in the 1980s was Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson who played for the Los Angeles Lakers.\nEarly life.\nHe grew up poor on Chicago's South Side. As a boy he showed a talent for basketball. At this time Thomas realized his basketball skills might help his family get out of poverty and the unsafe neighborhood. Thomas attended the Indiana University. He was a member of the US men's basketball team at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Because of the US boycott, the team did not go to Moscow.\nProfessional career.\nThomas was a first round draft choice by the Detroit Pistons. He was signed to a 4-year contract.
