{"id":52473,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_characters","text":"ce=\"preserve\">This article is about the fictional characters from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth universe.\nManw\u00EB.\nManw\u00EB S\u00FAlimo is the leader of the Valar. He is the lord of air and sky. His wife is Varda. He lives on the mountain of Taniquetil in Valinor, which is far west of Middle-earth.\nMorgoth.\nMelkor was originally the most powerful of the Valar, but he became evil. He was then named Morgoth (Sindarin: \"Black Enemy\"), and \"Morgoth Bauglir\" (Sindarin: \"Oppressor\"). Morgoth was the greatest enemy of all the peoples of Middle-earth during the First Age. He is the main villain of \"The Silmarillion\".\nSauron.\nSauron is a Maia who became evil. He became the Dark Lord Morgoth's chief lieutenant. In the Second Age he disguised himself as Annatar and told the elves how to make the Rings of Power. He created the One Ring in the volcano Mount Doom, in his land Mordor. Since then he is the Lord of the Rings.\nHe was killed in the Downfall of N\u00FAmenor, but again took form in Mordor. He was again defeated by the \"Last Alliance of Elves and Men\". Later in the Third Age, Sauron again came to life, searching for the Ring, and starting the \"War of the Ring\". Sauron was later defeated when the One Ring fell to the fires of Mount Doom with Gollum. Sauron is mentioned as the Necromancer in \"The Hobbit\".\nIstari.\nThe Istari (Quenya: \"Wise Ones\"; singular: \"Istar\") are a group of five Maiar. They came to Middle-earth in the Third Age, in the form of old human men. The names of the Istari are (in order of rank) Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown, Alatar the Blue and Pallando the Blue. The peoples of Middle-earth gave them many names, and called them \"wizards\".\nGandalf.\nGandalf the Grey is a main character in the books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". In the Third Age Gandalf came to Middle-earth as one of the Istari (or wizards). He worked much to help in the destruction of the One Ring, and in the War of the Ring. Later in the Third Age during the War of the Ring, he was later reborn as \"Gandalf the White and succeeded Saruman as the head of the Istari order. Gandalf is also known by other names: Ol\u00F3rin, Mithrandir, Thark\u00FBn, Inc\u00E1nus, Gandalf Stormcrow, Gandalf Greyhame, L\u00E1thspell, White Rider, The Grey Pilgrim, Old Greybeard, Gandalf the Wandering Wizard. C\u00EDrdan gave Gandalf the Elven Ring Narya, the Ring of Fire, which he had been given by Gil-galad. At the end of the Third Age, Gandalf left Middle-earth for Valinor, together with the bearers of the other two Elven Rings and the Ring-bearers of the One Ring.\nSaruman.\nSaruman the White is a character in the book \"The Lord of the Rings\". In the Third Age Saruman came to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. Saruman is also known as Curumo, Sharkey, Curun\u00EDr, Saruman of Many Colours, The White Wizard and Saruman the Wise by Gandalf the Grey. Saruman was the leader of the wizards and the White Council that opposed the Dark Lord Sauron. Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor and created an army of 10,000 Uruk-hai and many Isengard who bore his white hand on their faces and armories. Saruman was later expelled from the Order of Istari as its head by Gandalf who broke his black staff of power leaving him powerless. He later managed to convince the Ents who held him captive into letting him leave Isengard after he met the conditions of handing over the Keys of Orthanc. He then went to the Shire, which his ally Lotho Sackville-Baggins had brought under control. He spent his final days as a small-time criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the Orkish Shark\u00FB, meaning \"old man\"), until he was overthrown in the Battle of Bywater. In the aftermath of that battle Frodo confronted Saruman and exiled him from the Shire, but before he could leave, Gr\u00EDma killed him by slitting his throat with a dagger, on the very doorstep of Bag End.\nRadagast.\nRadagast the Brown is a character in the book \"The Lord of the Rings\". In the Third Age Radagast came to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. Radagast is also known as Aiwendil, Bird-Friend, Tender of Beasts, \"the Birdtamer\", \"the Simple\", and \"the Fool\". Radagast was a dweller in Rhosgobel with his animal friends. But, by the time of the War of the Ring, he was not a Rhosgobel dweller anymore. Later on Midsummer's Day, Radagast was sitting on the side of the Greenway with his horse near Bree when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the Nazg\u00FBl were abroad, disguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of the Shire. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by getting beasts and birds to send news to Orthanc. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood. By sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured. Saruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in Orthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of Saruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of Gwaihir. Radagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the Council of Elrond, many scouts were sent out from Rivendell to many different locations. Some passed over the Misty Mountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but they found that Radagast was not there.[6] His fate after the War of the Ring is not known.\nAlatar and Pallando.\nAlatar the Blue and Pallando the Blue are the Blue Wizards. They went into the east of Middle-earth. Little is known about them. Alatar was originally a Maia of Orom\u00EB the Huntsman named Morinehtar, and presumably lived in his forests on the continent of Aman, west of Middle-earth. The other servants of Orom\u00EB included R\u00F3mest\u00E1mo (later Pallando), who was a friend of Morinehtar's, and whom he later chose to journey with him. At some point in the Second Age, around the forging of the Rings of Power, Mohrinehtar and R\u00F3mest\u00E1mo were chosen to become the first of the Istari, and were sent to the East of Middle-earth to stir up rebellion against Sauron and assist the few tribes of Men who had refused to worship Morgoth in the First Age. Before he came to Middle-earth, Pallando was a Maia of Orom\u00EB the Huntsman. He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another Istar who took him as a friend. During the Third Age, the Valar selected Morinehtar, renamed Alatar, meaning \"after-comer\", and Pallando to be two of the five Maiar to travel from the Undying Lands to Middle-earth and serve as Istari wizards. Alatar, Curumo (Saruman the White) and Ol\u00F3rin (Gandalf the Grey) were assigned the objective of encouraging the peoples of Middle-earth to oppose Sauron. However, two more joined the original three Wizards and they became five. Aiwendil (Radagast the Brown) was chosen by Yavanna to travel with Curumo, and Alatar took Pallando the Blue as a companion. Upon arrival in Middle-earth, Alatar and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue. Due to this, they were called the Blue Wizards (or Ithryn Luin, in Sindarin). With Saruman, they travelled east in an attempt to help free the last Men of N\u00FAmenor, who were now Haradrim and Easterlings. Later, Saruman came back to the west alone. However, Alatar and Pallando were never seen again, and their ultimate fates are unknown. Pallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes) traveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to aid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons who worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing. Saruman later returned to the West, but Pallando along with Alatar stayed behind.
