{"id":52479,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Armenia","text":"The history of Armenia and Armenians is very ancient and can go back at least 2000 BC. Archaeologists say the Shulaveri-Shomu culture of the central Transcaucasus region, and Armenia today, as the earliest known prehistoric culture in the area, carbon-dated to around 6000 - 4000 BC. But, a newer discovered tomb has been dated to 9000 BC. Another early culture in the Armenian Highlands and surrounding areas\u2014the Kura-Araxes culture is in the period of ca. 4000 - 2200 BC, and is believed to have to go into the Trialeti culture (ca. 2200 - 1500 BC), and meaning Armenians are one of the oldest Indo-European subgroups.\nUrartu.\nUrartu was an ancient kingdom in the Armenian Highlands.\nSome experts say that the Armenians started as a mixture of the different peoples to move through the area in history: The Hurrians, Urarteans, Luvians and Mushki. This last group, also knowns as Phrygians may have brought their Indo-European language to Armenia. The Armenian language today is Indo-European, but shows a lot of influence from the earlier languages, especially Urartean.\nAncient period.\nThe Armenians had friendly relations with the Parthian empire. The fighting between the Roman Empire and Parthia was centered in Armenia. Armenia was in between Parthian and the Roman Empire. The Armenians had already played a role in the early history of the Roman-Parthian relations. Tigranes put military and political relations with Rome and Parthia on an international legal foundation. The Parthians were allies to Armenians in many times. Many Parthian noble families had moved out and they went to Armenia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenians","offset":27},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":175},{"uri":"Armenian_Highland","surface_form":"Armenian Highland","offset":369},{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenians","offset":564},{"uri":"Urartu","surface_form":"Urartu","offset":629},{"uri":"Armenian_Highland","surface_form":"Armenian Highland","offset":666},{"uri":"Hurrians","surface_form":"Hurrians","offset":809},{"uri":"Urartu","surface_form":"Urarteans","offset":819},{"uri":"Luvians","surface_form":"Luvians","offset":830},{"uri":"Mushki","surface_form":"Mushki","offset":842},{"uri":"Phrygia","surface_form":"Phrygia","offset":882},{"uri":"Indo-European","surface_form":"Indo-European","offset":915},{"uri":"Urartian_language","surface_form":"Urartean","offset":1064},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relations","offset":1117},{"uri":"Parthia","surface_form":"Parthian empire","offset":1136},{"uri":"Fight","surface_form":"fight","offset":1157},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":1178},{"uri":"Tigranes_the_Great","surface_form":"Tigranes","offset":1376},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1389},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":1402},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":1450},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"legal","offset":1464},{"uri":"Foundation","surface_form":"foundation","offset":1470},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"noble","offset":1550}]}
