{"id":524875,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimatic_defence","text":"Deimatic defence is when prey startle predators and so get time to escape. The predator gets a shock, and often jumps back when startled. Many prey use this tactic when a predator gets close. It is an anti-predator defence.\nThis method is a fake, where a real aposematic warning signal is genuine. Many species of frog put on warning displays; but only some of these species do have poison glands.\nDisplays are classified as deimatic or aposematic by the responses of the animals that see them.\nIn the second case, the behaviour is both deimatic and aposematic. It startles the predator, and the display truly indicates the prey is bad to eat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":25},{"uri":"Startle","surface_form":"startle","offset":30},{"uri":"Predators","surface_form":"predators","offset":38},{"uri":"Tactic","surface_form":"tactic","offset":157},{"uri":"Anti-predator_defence","surface_form":"anti-predator defence","offset":201},{"uri":"Aposematic","surface_form":"aposematic","offset":260},{"uri":"Venom","surface_form":"poison","offset":383},{"uri":"Aposematic","surface_form":"aposematic","offset":437}]}
