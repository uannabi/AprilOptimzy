{"id":524899,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye-spot_(mimicry)","text":"An eye-spot (or ocellus) is an eye-like marking on the body of an animal. They are found on butterflies, reptiles, felids, birds and fish.\nEye-spots may be a form of mimicry: the spot looks like the eye of a larger animal. Its function may be to draw a predator's attention away from the most vulnerable body parts; or to look like an unpleasant or dangerous animal.\nIn larger animals, eyespots may play a role in intraspecies communication or courtship \u2013 the best-known example is probably the eyespots on a peacock's display feathers.\nThere is evidence that eyespots in butterflies are anti-predator defences. Some are deimatic displays to distract, startle or scare off predators, or at least to deflect attacks away from vital body parts. Butterfly eyespots may also play a role in mate recognition and sexual selection, like the eyespots on larger organisms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":31},{"uri":"Butterflies","surface_form":"butterflies","offset":92},{"uri":"Reptiles","surface_form":"reptiles","offset":105},{"uri":"Felid","surface_form":"felid","offset":115},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":123},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":133},{"uri":"Mimicry","surface_form":"mimicry","offset":166},{"uri":"Predator","surface_form":"predator","offset":253},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":427},{"uri":"Courtship","surface_form":"courtship","offset":444},{"uri":"Peacock","surface_form":"peacock","offset":509},{"uri":"Anti-predator_defences","surface_form":"anti-predator defences","offset":588},{"uri":"Deimatic_display","surface_form":"deimatic display","offset":621},{"uri":"Sexual_selection","surface_form":"sexual selection","offset":807}]}
