In addition, Agricola, Aleksis Kivi and Elias L\u00F6nnrot are regarded fathers of a national literature in Finnish.\nIn his time, Finland was part of Sweden, a Catholic country. He learned the ideas of the Reformation, and thought everyone should be able to read the Bible. To help people in Finland to learn to read, Agricola published a ABC book and a prayer book in Finnish around year 1544. He also translated large sections of the Bible into Finnish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":50},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"written","offset":92},{"uri":"Finnish_language","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":100},{"uri":"Aleksis_Kivi","surface_form":"Aleksis Kivi","offset":133},{"uri":"Elias_L%C3%B6nnrot","surface_form":"Elias L\u00F6nnrot","offset":150},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":235},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":255},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":265},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":274},{"uri":"Reformation","surface_form":"Reformation","offset":311},{"uri":"Read","surface_form":"read","offset":363},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":372},{"uri":"ABC_book","surface_form":"ABC book","offset":444},{"uri":"Prayer_book","surface_form":"prayer book","offset":459},{"uri":"Translated","surface_form":"translated","offset":508}]}
