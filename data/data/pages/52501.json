The countries in the region produce oil, manganese ore, tea, citrus fruits, and wine.\nThe region is one the most complicated in the post-Soviet area, and has three heavily disputed areas \u2013 Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.\nHistory.\nThe region was combined togerther twice \u2013 during the Russian Civil War (Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic) from 9 April 1918 to 26 May 1918, and under the Soviet rule (Transcaucasian SFSR) from 12 March 1922 to 5 December 1936.\nThe area of Transcaucasia, which is where modern day Azerbaijan,Georgia and Armenia are located, is one of areas where the wine producing vines \"vitis vinifera\" grow. Some experts think that this may be where wine was produced for the first time. Archeological excavation and carbon dating of grape pips from the area have dated back to 7000-5000BC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caucasus","surface_form":"Caucasus","offset":109},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":133},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":144},{"uri":"Caucasus_(mountains)","surface_form":"Greater Caucasus","offset":165},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":189},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":201},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black","offset":230},{"uri":"Caspian_Sea","surface_form":"Caspian Sea","offset":240},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":261},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":306},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":318},{"uri":"Exclave","surface_form":"exclave","offset":344},{"uri":"Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic","surface_form":"Nax\u00E7\u0131van","offset":355},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"oil","offset":424},{"uri":"Manganese","surface_form":"manganese ore","offset":429},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":444},{"uri":"Citrus_fruits","surface_form":"citrus fruits","offset":449},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":468},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":525},{"uri":"Abkhazia","surface_form":"Abkhazia","offset":577},{"uri":"South_Ossetia","surface_form":"South Ossetia","offset":590},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":607},{"uri":"Nagorno-Karabakh","surface_form":"Nagorno-Karabakh","offset":620},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":640},{"uri":"Russian_Civil_War","surface_form":"Russian Civil War","offset":714},{"uri":"Transcaucasian_Democratic_Federative_Republic","surface_form":"Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic","offset":733},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":828},{"uri":"Transcaucasian_SFSR","surface_form":"Transcaucasian SFSR","offset":841},{"uri":"Vitis_vinifera","surface_form":"vitis vinifera","offset":1046},{"uri":"Grape_pips","surface_form":"grape pips","offset":1194}]}
