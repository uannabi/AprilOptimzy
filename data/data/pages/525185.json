Looking for gold and a rumored \"Fountain of Youth, he landed on the southeast coast of North America near present-day St. Augustine, Florida. He claimed the lands for Spain and named it \"La Florida\" (place of flowers). In 1521, on his second trip to Florida, he was wounded in an attack. The expedition returned to Cuba where he died in July 1521 from his wound.\nEarly life.\nPonce de Le\u00F3n was born in 1460 in Santerv\u00E1s de Campos, Spain. He was born into a poor but noble family. His parents may have died while he was still young. He was sent to the estate of Pedro N\u00FA\u00F1ez de Guzm\u00E1n, Lord of Toral, to serve as a page. He became a soldier and fought against the Moors in Granada. He was probably with Christoper Columbus on his second voyage.\nHe eventually became a soldier and fought against the Moors in Granada. Like other conquistadores, Ponce de Le\u00F3n soon sought fame and fortune through exploration, and it is believed he began his quest as part of Christopher Columbus's second expedition in 1493.\nHispaniola.\nSome ten years later he was a Captain under Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando, the governor of the island of Hispaniola. Ponce de Le\u00F3n put down a mutiny and was made governor of the eastern province of Hispaniola. Ponce de Le\u00F3n received a substantial land grant which authorized sufficient Taino slave labor to farm his new estate.\nPonce de Le\u00F3n prospered in this new role. He found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby Boca de Yuma. This was where Spanish ships stocked supplies before the long voyage back to Spain. In 1505 Ovando authorized Ponce de Le\u00F3n to establish a new town in Hig\u00FCey, which he named Salvale\u00F3n. In 1508 King Ferdinand authorized Ponce de Le\u00F3n to conquer the remaining Tainos and exploit them in gold mining.\nAround this time, Ponce de Le\u00F3n married Leonora, an innkeeper's daughter. They had three daughters (Juana, Isabel and Maria) and one son (Luis). The large stone house Ponce de Le\u00F3n ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of Salvale\u00F3n de Hig\u00FCey.\nPuerto Rico and Bimini.\nIn 1508 Ponce de Le\u00F3n led an expedition to what is now Puerto Rico. They searched for and found gold. After founding a colony there he was appointed governor.\nFirst expedition.\nIn 1513, with three ships, Ponce de Le\u00F3n led an expedition to discover what is now the east coast of Florida. According to tradition, he landed at or near St. Augustine, Florida. He named the place \"La Florida\". This is most probably because he landed during the Spanish Easter celebration called Pascua Florida. After exploring the coast further, they returned to Puerto Rico.\nSecond expedition.\nPonce de Le\u00F3n returned in 1521 with 200 settlers. They brought cattle, horses, and what they needed to farm the land. As they were building the settlement they were attacked by local Indians. In the fighting Ponce de Le\u00F3n received a mortal wound, possibly by a poisoned arrow. The party returned to Cuba where Ponce de Le\u00F3n died. He was buried in what is now San Juan before the alter of the Dominican church. His remains were later moved to San Juan cathedral.\nFountain of youth.\nThe story of a fountain of youth goes back many centuries. Herodotus (425 \u2013 484 BC) talked about a group he called the Macrobians who lived somewhere in modern day Ethiopia. He said they remained youthful, were physically strong and lived a long time. Calling it a fountain of youth came much later. The stories of Ponce de Le\u00F3n and his search for a fountain of youth developed after his death. There is no mention of such a goal in any of his orders. In 1535 the Spanish historian Gonzalo Fern\u00E1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00E9s first stated Ponce de Le\u00F3n was searching for a fountain of youth. The legend was repeated by later writers and embellished.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":37},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":45},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":55},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"colonial governor","offset":68},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":99},{"uri":"Fountain_of_Youth","surface_form":"Fountain of Youth","offset":119},{"uri":"Southeast","surface_form":"southeast","offset":155},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":174},{"uri":"St._Augustine%2C_Florida","surface_form":"St. Augustine, Florida","offset":205},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":254},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":337},{"uri":"Wound","surface_form":"wound","offset":353},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":367},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":379},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":402},{"uri":"Santerv%C3%A1s_de_Campos","surface_form":"Santerv\u00E1s de Campos","offset":496},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":517},{"uri":"Estate_(house)","surface_form":"estate","offset":637},{"uri":"Pedro_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_de_Guzm%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Pedro N\u00FA\u00F1ez de Guzm\u00E1n","offset":647},{"uri":"Page_(servant)","surface_form":"page","offset":699},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":717},{"uri":"Moor","surface_form":"Moor","offset":748},{"uri":"Granada","surface_form":"Granada","offset":757},{"uri":"Christoper_Columbus","surface_form":"Christoper Columbus","offset":787},{"uri":"Voyage","surface_form":"voyage","offset":821},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"Captain","offset":1133},{"uri":"Nicol%C3%A1s_de_Ovando","surface_form":"Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando","offset":1147},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":1186},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":1196},{"uri":"Mutiny","surface_form":"mutiny","offset":1233},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"east","offset":1269},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":1277},{"uri":"Land_grant","surface_form":"land grant","offset":1338},{"uri":"Taino","surface_form":"Taino","offset":1377},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slave labor","offset":1383},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":1478},{"uri":"Produce","surface_form":"farm produce","offset":1493},{"uri":"Livestock","surface_form":"livestock","offset":1510},{"uri":"Boca_de_Yuma","surface_form":"Boca de Yuma","offset":1530},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":1567},{"uri":"Supplies","surface_form":"supplies","offset":1581},{"uri":"Voyage","surface_form":"voyage","offset":1606},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":1687},{"uri":"Hig%C3%BCey","surface_form":"Hig\u00FCey","offset":1695},{"uri":"Salvale%C3%B3n_de_Hig%C3%BCey","surface_form":"Salvale\u00F3n","offset":1718},{"uri":"Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Ferdinand","offset":1742},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"gold mining","offset":1829},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":1874},{"uri":"Inn","surface_form":"innkeeper's","offset":1894},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":1997},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":2003},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":2196},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"east","offset":2405},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":2419},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":2589},{"uri":"Pascua_Florida","surface_form":"Pascua Florida","offset":2615},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":2778},{"uri":"Horses","surface_form":"horses","offset":2786},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":2818},{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":2859},{"uri":"Attack","surface_form":"attack","offset":2880},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Indians","offset":2898},{"uri":"San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"San Juan","offset":3074},{"uri":"San_Juan_cathedral","surface_form":"San Juan cathedral","offset":3157},{"uri":"Herodotus","surface_form":"Herodotus","offset":3255},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":3276},{"uri":"Macrobians","surface_form":"Macrobians","offset":3315},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":3360},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":3668},{"uri":"Gonzalo_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Oviedo_y_Vald%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Gonzalo Fern\u00E1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00E9s","offset":3678},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":3785},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":3814},{"uri":"Embellishment","surface_form":"embellished","offset":3826}]}
