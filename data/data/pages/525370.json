He became well-known as the medical director of Women's Health Care Services, one of only three clinics nationwide to provide late-term abortions at the time.\nDuring his tenure with the center, which began in 1975 and continued the medical practice of his father, Tiller was targeted with protest and violence by anti-abortion groups and individuals. After his clinic was firebombed in 1986, Tiller was shot in both arms by anti-abortion extremist Shelley Shannon in 1993.\nOn May 31, 2009, Tiller was fatally shot in the side of the head by anti-abortion extremist Scott Roeder, as Tiller served as an usher during the Sunday morning service at his church in Wichita. Roeder was convicted of murder on January 29, 2010, and sentenced to life imprisonment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Doctor_of_Medicine","surface_form":"MD","offset":23},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":65},{"uri":"Wichita%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Wichita, Kansas","offset":97},{"uri":"Medical_director","surface_form":"medical director","offset":142},{"uri":"Late-term_abortions","surface_form":"late-term abortions","offset":240},{"uri":"United_States_pro-life_movement","surface_form":"anti-abortion","offset":427},{"uri":"Firebombing","surface_form":"firebombed","offset":486},{"uri":"Shelley_Shannon","surface_form":"Shelley Shannon","offset":562},{"uri":"Scott_Roeder","surface_form":"Scott Roeder","offset":679},{"uri":"Church_usher","surface_form":"usher","offset":716}]}
