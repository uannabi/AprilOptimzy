Zeus was too late, as Metis was already pregnant.\nWhile she was inside Zeus's head, Metis made a helmet, armor, and a robe for Athena. The hammering noise caused Zeus to have a severe headache. The headache became worse then Hephaestus split his head open and Athena came out full grown and with armor on.\nTitles and patronages.\nAthena is the goddess of knowledge, purity, arts, crafts, learning, justice and wisdom.
