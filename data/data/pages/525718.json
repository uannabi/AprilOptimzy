{"id":525718,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_Valley","text":"The Willamette Valley () is a long valley in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The entire valley is in the state of Oregon. The valley contains the political and cultural areas of Oregon. It is home to about 70\u00A0percent of its population. This includes Portland, its largest city, and Salem, the state capital. The Willamette River flows the entire length of the valley. The valley is surrounded by mountains on three sides - the Oregon Coast Range to the west, the Cascade Range to the east, and the Calapooya Mountains to the south.\nThe valley's many waterways are important to the economy of Oregon. They continuously put highly fertile alluvial soils on the valley's broad, flat plain. The valley was widely publicized in the 1820s as a 'promised land of flowing milk and honey'. Throughout the 19th century it was the destination for the oxen-drawn wagon trains of people on the Oregon Trail.\nToday the valley is home to \"Oregon Wine Country\". Tt contains more than 19,000 acres of vineyards and 500+ wineries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":35},{"uri":"Pacific_Northwest","surface_form":"Pacific Northwest","offset":49},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":81},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":133},{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":165},{"uri":"Cultural","surface_form":"cultural","offset":179},{"uri":"Portland%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Portland","offset":269},{"uri":"Salem%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Salem","offset":301},{"uri":"State_capital","surface_form":"state capital","offset":312},{"uri":"Willamette_River","surface_form":"Willamette River","offset":331},{"uri":"Surround","surface_form":"surrounded","offset":401},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":415},{"uri":"Oregon_Coast_Range","surface_form":"Oregon Coast Range","offset":446},{"uri":"Cascade_Range","surface_form":"Cascade Range","offset":482},{"uri":"Calapooya_Mountains","surface_form":"Calapooya Mountains","offset":517},{"uri":"Waterway","surface_form":"waterway","offset":569},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":600},{"uri":"Fertility","surface_form":"fertile","offset":648},{"uri":"Alluvium","surface_form":"alluvial","offset":656},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":665},{"uri":"Publicize","surface_form":"publicize","offset":728},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":815},{"uri":"Oxen","surface_form":"oxen","offset":859},{"uri":"Wagon_train","surface_form":"wagon train","offset":870},{"uri":"Oregon_Trail","surface_form":"Oregon Trail","offset":900},{"uri":"Vineyard","surface_form":"vineyard","offset":1003},{"uri":"Winery","surface_form":"wineries","offset":1022}]}
