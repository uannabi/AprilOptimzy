A carpetbagger was a northerner who moved to the South after the American Civil War. This period is called the \"reconstruction era\".\n\"Carpetbagger\" referred to the cheap carpet bags (a form of luggage) which many of the newcomers carried. The term came to be associated with opportunism and exploitation by outsiders. It is used today for a \"parachute candidate\": a political candidate for public office in an area far from home.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":32},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":130},{"uri":"Carpet_bag","surface_form":"carpet bag","offset":235},{"uri":"Luggage","surface_form":"luggage","offset":258},{"uri":"Parachute_candidate","surface_form":"parachute candidate","offset":407},{"uri":"Candidate","surface_form":"candidate","offset":441}]}
