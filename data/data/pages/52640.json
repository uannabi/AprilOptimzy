{"id":52640,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management","text":"Project management is the way a person organizes and manages resources that are necessary to complete a project. People that manage projects are known as Project Managers.\nA project is a piece of work which is not a process or an operation. It has a start, an end, and goals. Projects can be very simple, like organising a party, or very complex, like building a space rocket.\nProjects are common in the construction industry, the telecommunications industry and the IT industry.\nThe management of a project requires special skills.\nProject managers must ensure that the project is delivered within the existing limitations. These limitations can be time, cost, people, risk, and many more. Project managers must also ensure the best possible distribution of resources.\nA project manager works mainly with people. They need to have people management skills, a good understanding of the tasks and skills needed on a project, an understanding of how long tasks will take, good organising skills, good communication skills, and good efficiency skills.\nProject managers do not need to know how to do all of the work that may be needed in a project. For instance, a building project manager does not need to know how to pour concrete. However, they need to know how to manage people that pour concrete, and they need to know how long concrete takes to pour, how much it costs, what needs to happen before concrete is poured, and what needs to happen after concrete is poured.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Project","surface_form":"project","offset":104},{"uri":"Project","surface_form":"project","offset":174},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":216},{"uri":"Management","surface_form":"management","offset":484}]}
