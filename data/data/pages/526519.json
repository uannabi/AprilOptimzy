The author of the poem is unknown.\nThe epic poem is the oldest example of the \"chanson de geste\". This was a literary form popular between the 11th and 15th centuries. It was all about legendary deeds and heroes.\nHistorical event.\nThe poem is about an actual historical event that happened centuries earlier. In 778 Charlemagne invaded Spain. On his way through the Pyrenees he looted and plundered Basque lands. He found little resistance in Spain until he reached the city of Zaragoza. Charlemagne demanded they surrender. The city governor, Hussain Ibn al-Ansari, refused. Charlemagne then laid siege to the city but with little success. Finally the governor paid Charlemagne a large amount of gold in return for Charlemagne's army leaving the area. Charlemagne had a pending Saxon revolt at home so he needed little persuasion to leave.\nAs Charlemagne marched north back to France he again passed through Basque territory. His large army was deep in the Pyrenees in a long column on August 15, 778. His rearguard was commanded by Roland, one of Charlemagne's most trusted leaders. The rearguard was attacked starting the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. The Basques using their knowledge of the terrain were able to overcome the Frankish rearguard. But their job was to protect the main army so they fought to the last man. The Basques plundered the baggage trains and captured the gold Charlemagne was paid at Zaragoza. Before the Frankish army could turn to fight the Basques, they had gone. Roland and his men died as heroes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Epic_poetry","surface_form":"epic poem","offset":30},{"uri":"Battle_of_Roncevaux","surface_form":"Battle of Roncevaux","offset":53},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":91},{"uri":"Charlemagne","surface_form":"Charlemagne","offset":100},{"uri":"French_literature","surface_form":"French literature","offset":155},{"uri":"Manuscript","surface_form":"manuscript","offset":197},{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popularity","offset":239},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th","offset":262},{"uri":"14th_century","surface_form":"14th centuries","offset":270},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"text","offset":438},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"lines","offset":459},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":468},{"uri":"Laisse","surface_form":"laisse","offset":531},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":584},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":595},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":654},{"uri":"Chanson_de_geste","surface_form":"chanson de geste","offset":670},{"uri":"Literary_genre","surface_form":"literary form","offset":700},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th","offset":734},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th centuries","offset":743},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":776},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":796},{"uri":"Historical_event","surface_form":"historical event","offset":850},{"uri":"Charlemagne","surface_form":"Charlemagne","offset":907},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invaded","offset":919},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":927},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":957},{"uri":"Looting","surface_form":"looted","offset":969},{"uri":"Looting","surface_form":"plundered","offset":980},{"uri":"Basque_Country_(greater_region)","surface_form":"Basque","offset":990},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":1061},{"uri":"Zaragoza","surface_form":"Zaragoza","offset":1069},{"uri":"Surrender","surface_form":"surrender","offset":1105},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":1125},{"uri":"Siege","surface_form":"siege","offset":1189},{"uri":"Success","surface_form":"success","offset":1223},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":1288},{"uri":"Saxon","surface_form":"Saxon","offset":1370},{"uri":"Revolt","surface_form":"revolt","offset":1376},{"uri":"Persuasion","surface_form":"persuasion","offset":1411},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":1455},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1469},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":1507},{"uri":"Battle_of_Roncevaux_Pass","surface_form":"Battle of Roncevaux Pass","offset":1716},{"uri":"Frankish","surface_form":"Frankish","offset":1817},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":2109}]}
