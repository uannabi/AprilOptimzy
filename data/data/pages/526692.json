{"id":526692,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Piggott","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lester Keith Piggott (born 5 November 1935) is a retired English professional jockey. With 4,493 career wins, including nine Epsom Derby victories, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest flat racing jockeys of all time.\nHe is known as \"The Long Fellow\". He was known for his competitive personality, keeping himself thirty pounds under his natural weight, and on occasion not sparing the whip on horses such as Nijinsky. Piggott regarded Sir Ivor as the easiest to ride of the great winners.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":70},{"uri":"Jockey","surface_form":"jockey","offset":91},{"uri":"Epsom_Derby","surface_form":"Epsom Derby","offset":138},{"uri":"Flat_racing","surface_form":"flat racing","offset":206},{"uri":"Nijinsky_II","surface_form":"Nijinsky","offset":430},{"uri":"Sir_Ivor","surface_form":"Sir Ivor","offset":457}]}
