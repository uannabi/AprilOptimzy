{"id":5267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson","text":"Michael Duane Johnson (born in September 13, 1967), Dallas, Texas is an American retired sprinter. He is widely considered the greatest long sprinter of all time. During his time on the track, he established world records for the 400 m (43.18 Seville, Spain), indoor 400 m, indoor 300 m, 200 m, and 4 \u00D7 400 m relay. Due to these achievements, and due to the vast difference between the 200 m and 400 m, Johnson left little doubt that he is the greatest sprinter of all time. He won four Olympic gold medals and eight World Championships gold medals.\nA fifth Olympic gold medal was taken back when it was learned that Johnson's teammates had cheated by using drugs.\nJohnson had a unique upright posture when he ran so that he looked like a duck walk, which gave him the nickname \"The Duck\". His running gait did not make sense for running fast, but somehow worked. He won almost every race that he ever ran.\nHe was the first athlete to win both the 200m and 400m sprints in the same Olympic Games (Atlanta, Georgia).\nHe retired in 2001, and is a sports commentator on TV. He was a contestant in the 2010 season of \"The Celebrity Apprentice\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dallas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":52},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":60},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":72},{"uri":"Retirement","surface_form":"retired","offset":81},{"uri":"Sprint_(running)","surface_form":"sprint","offset":89},{"uri":"Long_sprint","surface_form":"long sprint","offset":136},{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":243},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":252},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic","offset":487},{"uri":"IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics","surface_form":"World Championships","offset":517},{"uri":"Atlanta","surface_form":"Atlanta","offset":997},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":1006},{"uri":"The_Celebrity_Apprentice","surface_form":"The Celebrity Apprentice","offset":1114}]}
