{"id":526858,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome","text":"e=\"preserve\">Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), previously known as multiple organ failure (MOF), Total organ failure(TOF) or multisystem organ failure (MSOF), is when the organ function is acutely ill and the patient is required medical intervention to achieve homeostasis. It usually involves two or more organ systems.\nThe use of \"multiple organ failure\" or \"multisystem organ failure\" should be avoided since that phrase was based upon physiological parameters to determine whether or not a particular organ was failing.\nCause.\nThe condition usually results from infection, injury (accident, surgery), hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism. The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Sepsis is the most common cause in operative and non-operative patients. Sepsis may result in septic shock.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organ","offset":181},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medical","offset":239},{"uri":"Homeostasis","surface_form":"homeostasis","offset":271},{"uri":"Physiological","surface_form":"physiological","offset":449},{"uri":"Parameters","surface_form":"parameters","offset":463},{"uri":"Hypoperfusion","surface_form":"hypoperfusion","offset":615},{"uri":"Hypermetabolism","surface_form":"hypermetabolism","offset":633},{"uri":"Inflammation","surface_form":"inflammatory response","offset":693},{"uri":"Sepsis","surface_form":"Sepsis","offset":716},{"uri":"Septic_shock","surface_form":"septic shock","offset":810}]}
