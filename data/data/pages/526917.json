{"id":526917,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry","text":"Laundry is the washing of clothing. Laundry is often done in a special room called a \"laundry room\". Some shared homes have shared laundry rooms. Businesses that wash clothes are called laundromats.\nLaundry is done by washing with soap and water. The clothing is stirred roughly in the soapy water, and then moved to be rinsed in clean water. Washing can be done by hand or with a washing machine. The clothing is dried in a clothes dryer or on a clothesline. Sometimes after the clothes are dry, they are ironed or pressed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Washing","surface_form":"washing","offset":15},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":26},{"uri":"Room","surface_form":"room","offset":71},{"uri":"Laundry_room","surface_form":"laundry room","offset":86},{"uri":"Apartment","surface_form":"shared homes","offset":106},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"Business","offset":146},{"uri":"Laundromat","surface_form":"laundromat","offset":186},{"uri":"Soap","surface_form":"soap","offset":231},{"uri":"Washing_machine","surface_form":"washing machine","offset":381},{"uri":"Clothes_dryer","surface_form":"clothes dryer","offset":425},{"uri":"Clothesline","surface_form":"clothesline","offset":447},{"uri":"Ironing","surface_form":"ironed","offset":506},{"uri":"Press","surface_form":"pressed","offset":516}]}
