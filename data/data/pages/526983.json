{"id":526983,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(numbers)","text":"=\"preserve\">In mathematics, precision describes the level of exactness in a number's digits, such as number 54.6 having precision 1 (one decimal digit). A number with end zeroes (\"00\") has a negative precision, such as 500 having precision -2, or 4,000 as precision -3. A whole number (not ending in \"0\") has precision 0.\nThe level of precision differs from the word \"accuracy\" of a number, which means the correctness or truth of a number as used to describe an item or count.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":15},{"uri":"Whole_number","surface_form":"whole number","offset":272},{"uri":"Accuracy","surface_form":"accuracy","offset":368}]}
