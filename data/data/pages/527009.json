It debuted in Japan in 1996.\nIn 1997 the five-passenger compact utility vehicle was introduced in North America. At first it was available only as a four-wheel drive model. It was powered by a 126-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Honda first began producing the CR-V in Sayama, Japan, and Swindon, UK, for worldwide markets. It added North American manufacturing sites in East Liberty, Ohio, in 2007; El Salto, Jalisco, Mexico, in late 2007; and Alliston, Ontario, Canada, in 2012.\nThe CR-V also is produced in Wuhan (Hubei province) for the Chinese market by the Dongfeng Honda Automobile Company. They are a joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Corporation. The CR-V is Honda's second smallest utility vehicle, slotting between the smaller HR-V and the larger Pilot. In 2015 the CR-V was named \"Motor Trend\" SUV of the year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Compact_car","surface_form":"compact","offset":20},{"uri":"SUV","surface_form":"SUV","offset":28},{"uri":"Honda","surface_form":"Honda","offset":60},{"uri":"Honda_Civic","surface_form":"Honda Civic","offset":95},{"uri":"Debut","surface_form":"debut","offset":111},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":122},{"uri":"Compact_car","surface_form":"compact","offset":164},{"uri":"Utility_vehicle","surface_form":"utility vehicle","offset":172},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":206},{"uri":"Horsepower","surface_form":"horsepower","offset":305},{"uri":"Multi-cylinder_engine","surface_form":"four-cylinder engine","offset":326},{"uri":"Sayama","surface_form":"Sayama","offset":388},{"uri":"Swindon","surface_form":"Swindon","offset":407},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":416},{"uri":"Worldwide","surface_form":"worldwide","offset":424},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":452},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":467},{"uri":"East_Liberty%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"East Liberty, Ohio","offset":490},{"uri":"El_Salto%2C_Jalisco","surface_form":"El Salto, Jalisco","offset":519},{"uri":"Alliston%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Alliston, Ontario","offset":564},{"uri":"Wuhan","surface_form":"Wuhan","offset":629},{"uri":"Hubei","surface_form":"Hubei","offset":636},{"uri":"Dongfeng_Honda_Automobile_Company","surface_form":"Dongfeng Honda Automobile Company","offset":682},{"uri":"Joint_venture","surface_form":"joint venture","offset":728},{"uri":"Dongfeng_Motor_Corporation","surface_form":"Dongfeng Motor Corporation","offset":747},{"uri":"Honda_HR-V","surface_form":"HR-V","offset":857},{"uri":"Honda_Pilot","surface_form":"Pilot","offset":877},{"uri":"Motor_Trend_Car_of_the_Year","surface_form":"\"Motor Trend\" SUV of the year","offset":911}]}
