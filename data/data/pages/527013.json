{"id":527013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C3%B1a_colada","text":"A pi\u00F1a colada is a special kind of mixed cocktail. It is usually made of rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. It is usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, a maraschino cherry, or both. Pi\u00F1a colada is the national drink of Puerto Rico.\nThere are many claims to be the first to invent the pi\u00F1a colada. Bartender Ramon \u201CMonchito\u201D Marrero is claimed to be the inventor over fifty years ago by the Puerto Rican government. But there are three places in Puerto Rico that claim to be the home of the Pi\u00F1a Colada. There was also a version made in Cuba as early as 1922.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cocktail","surface_form":"cocktail","offset":41},{"uri":"Rum","surface_form":"rum","offset":73},{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut cream","offset":78},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":97},{"uri":"Mix","surface_form":"blended","offset":142},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":165},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":204},{"uri":"Cherry","surface_form":"maraschino cherry","offset":223},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":288},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invent","offset":342},{"uri":"Bar_(business)","surface_form":"Bar","offset":366},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":472},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":605}]}
