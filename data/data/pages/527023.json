{"id":527023,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roommate","text":"A roommate is a person who shares a room, apartment (British flat) or house with others. A housemate (mainly British) is someone who shares a house with others. For students living on a university campus, having at least one roommate is a traditional arrangement. Most college and university dormitories are designed for two roommates. There is a new trend among college students to request a room to themselves. Many colleges and universities are very willing to give what is called a 'super single' to one student who wants privacy.\nThe reason many get one or more roommates is to save money. As rents keep increasing, they are sometimes going up faster than wages in an area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Room","surface_form":"room","offset":36},{"uri":"Apartment","surface_form":"apartment","offset":42},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British","offset":53},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":165},{"uri":"Campus","surface_form":"university campus","offset":186},{"uri":"Traditional","surface_form":"traditional","offset":239},{"uri":"Dormitory","surface_form":"dormitories","offset":292},{"uri":"Trend","surface_form":"trend","offset":351},{"uri":"Rent","surface_form":"rent","offset":598},{"uri":"Wikt","surface_form":"wage","offset":661}]}
