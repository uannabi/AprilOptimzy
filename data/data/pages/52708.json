{"id":52708,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastika","text":"e=\"preserve\">Astika (Sanskrit:: \"orthodox\") and Nastika: (\"heterodox\") are technical terms in Hinduism used to classify philosophical schools and persons, according to whether they accept the authority of the Vedas as supreme revealed scriptures, or not. By this definition, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta are classified as \"astika\" schools; while Charvaka, Jainism and Buddhism are considered \"nastika\" schools.\nIn non-technical usage, the term \"astika\" is sometimes loosely translated as \"theist\" while \"nastika\" is translated as \"atheist\". However this interpretation is distinct from the use of the term in Hindu philosophy. Notably even among the \"astika\" schools, \"samkhya\" and the early \"mimamsa\" school do not accept a God (see Atheism in Hinduism) while accepting the authority of the Vedas; they thus are \"atheistic \"astika\" schools\".\nAt an early period, during the formation of the Upani\u015Fads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions... These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (\"n\u0101stika\") by orthodox (\"\u0101stika\") Brahmanism.\nTantras are... also divided as \"\u0101stika\" or Vedic and \"n\u0101stika\" or non-Vedic. In accordance with the predominance of the deity the \"\u0101stika\" works are again divided as \u015A\u0101kta, \u015Aaiva, Saura, G\u0101\u1E47apatya and Vai\u1E63\u1E47ava.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":21},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":94},{"uri":"Hindu_philosophy","surface_form":"philosophical schools","offset":120},{"uri":"Vedas","surface_form":"Vedas","offset":209},{"uri":"Nyaya","surface_form":"Nyaya","offset":275},{"uri":"Vaisheshika","surface_form":"Vaisheshika","offset":282},{"uri":"Samkhya","surface_form":"Samkhya","offset":295},{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"Yoga","offset":304},{"uri":"Mimamsa","surface_form":"Purva Mimamsa","offset":310},{"uri":"Vedanta","surface_form":"Vedanta","offset":328},{"uri":"Charvaka","surface_form":"Charvaka","offset":378},{"uri":"Jainism","surface_form":"Jainism","offset":388},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":400},{"uri":"Theist","surface_form":"theist","offset":521},{"uri":"Atheist","surface_form":"atheist","offset":563},{"uri":"Ishvara","surface_form":"God","offset":757},{"uri":"Atheism_in_Hinduism","surface_form":"Atheism in Hinduism","offset":766},{"uri":"Upanishad","surface_form":"Upani\u015Fads","offset":923}]}
