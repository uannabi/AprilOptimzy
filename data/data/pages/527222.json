{"id":527222,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bar","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gay bars are drinking establishments that cater to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. The term \"gay\" is used as an inclusive concept for LGBT communities. Gay bars once served as the centre of gay culture. They were one of the few places people with same-sex orientations and gender-variant identities could openly socialize. Other names include \"boy bar\", \"girl bar\", \"lesbian bar\" or \"dyke bar\".\nThe Stonewall Inn in New York City is one example of a gay/lesbian bar. The gay rights movement was born there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bar_(business)","surface_form":"drinking establishment","offset":26},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender","offset":64},{"uri":"Same-sex","surface_form":"same-sex","offset":274},{"uri":"Boy","surface_form":"boy","offset":371},{"uri":"Girl","surface_form":"girl","offset":382},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":394},{"uri":"Stonewall_Inn","surface_form":"Stonewall Inn","offset":426},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":443}]}
