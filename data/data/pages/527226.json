It was also the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots. The original inn closed in 1969. In 1990, a bar named \"Stonewall\" opened in the western half of the original location.\nIn June 2015, the Stonewall received an official landmark status from New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission for its role as the catalyst of the LGBT movement. It is the first landmark in New York City that has been recognized due to its status in LGBT history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":43},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":47},{"uri":"Bar_(business)","surface_form":"tavern","offset":55},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":86},{"uri":"Stonewall_riots","surface_form":"Stonewall riots","offset":134},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":231},{"uri":"New_York_City_Landmarks_Preservation_Commission","surface_form":"New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission","offset":340},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":408},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":424}]}
