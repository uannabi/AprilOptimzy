He is known for his research in the theory of algorithms, for which he received a Turing Award in 1985, The Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science in 2004, and the Kyoto Prize in 2008.\nHe work includes solving problems of combinatorial optimization (mostly network flow), asking questions about what an efficient algorithm looks like, and works about algorithmic complexity theory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":50},{"uri":"Computer_scientist","surface_form":"computer scientist","offset":59},{"uri":"Computational_theorist","surface_form":"computational theorist","offset":82},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":112},{"uri":"Theory_of_algorithms","surface_form":"theory of algorithms","offset":184},{"uri":"Turing_Award","surface_form":"Turing Award","offset":230},{"uri":"The_Franklin_Institute_Awards","surface_form":"The Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science in 2004","offset":252},{"uri":"Kyoto_Prize","surface_form":"Kyoto Prize","offset":331},{"uri":"Combinatorial_optimization","surface_form":"combinatorial optimization","offset":389},{"uri":"Network_flow","surface_form":"network flow","offset":424},{"uri":"Algorithmic_efficiency","surface_form":"efficient algorithm","offset":470},{"uri":"Complexity_theory","surface_form":"complexity theory","offset":530}]}
