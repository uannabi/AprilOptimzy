{"id":527596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_Rebel_truck","text":"The Ram Rebel is a full-size pickup truck made by FCA US LLC (formerly Chrysler Group LLC). The Rebel is a new model for 2015. It has a new grille and tailgate which are different than the regular Ram Trucks. The Ram 1500 Rebel is not just a decal package. It is designed for use both on-road and off-road. The Rebel has features that are standard that would otherwise have to be added by the owner for off-road performance.\nFeatures.\nThe Rebel is available only in the 1500 (half-ton) truck series. It features a blacked-out grille with a large \"RAM\" letter badge. It stands out as being very different from the RAM truck's iconic \"cross-hair\" design grilles. Standard equipment includes an off-road powder coated front bumper, skid plates, tow hooks and fog lights. It has projector headlamps with LED marker lights. The aluminum sports hood is distinct to the Rebel.\nThe Rebel is standard with an air suspension that rides higher than other RAM 1500s. It has new 17-inch aluminum wheels with black accents. It comes with 33-inch (LT285/70R17E) Toyo Open Country A/T all-terrain tires, Bilstein shock absorbers, and has a different steering and stability-control system than a stock RAM. The Rebel is not intended to be a competitor to the Ford Raptor or the RAM Power Wagon although it is often compared to them.\nPowertrains.\nThe standard engine in the Rebel is a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine that makes 310 horsepower, 269 pound-feet of torque. It is capable of getting 25 mpg on the highway. The optional V-8 engine is a 5.7-liter HEMI that produces 395 horsepower and 410 pound-feet of torque. It is rated at 15 mpg in the city, 21 mpg on the highway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Full-size_vehicle","surface_form":"full-size","offset":19},{"uri":"Pickup_truck","surface_form":"pickup truck","offset":29},{"uri":"Chrysler","surface_form":"FCA US LLC","offset":50},{"uri":"Model","surface_form":"model","offset":111},{"uri":"Ram_Trucks","surface_form":"Ram Trucks","offset":197},{"uri":"Off-road_vehicle","surface_form":"off-road","offset":297},{"uri":"Owner","surface_form":"owner","offset":393},{"uri":"Badge","surface_form":"badge","offset":559},{"uri":"Iconic","surface_form":"iconic","offset":625},{"uri":"Powder_coating","surface_form":"powder coated","offset":701},{"uri":"Bumper_(automobile)","surface_form":"bumper","offset":721},{"uri":"Skid_plate","surface_form":"skid plate","offset":729},{"uri":"Towing","surface_form":"tow hooks","offset":742},{"uri":"Automotive_lighting","surface_form":"fog lights","offset":756},{"uri":"Headlamp","surface_form":"projector headlamps","offset":775},{"uri":"LED","surface_form":"LED","offset":800},{"uri":"Automotive_lighting","surface_form":"marker lights","offset":804},{"uri":"Aluminum","surface_form":"aluminum","offset":823},{"uri":"Hood_(vehicle)","surface_form":"hood","offset":839},{"uri":"Air_suspension","surface_form":"air suspension","offset":900},{"uri":"Wheel","surface_form":"wheel","offset":983},{"uri":"Toyo_Tire_%26amp%3B_Rubber_Company","surface_form":"Toyo","offset":1047},{"uri":"Tire","surface_form":"tire","offset":1081},{"uri":"Shock_absorber","surface_form":"shock absorber","offset":1097},{"uri":"Steering","surface_form":"steering","offset":1134},{"uri":"Electronic_stability_control","surface_form":"stability-control system","offset":1147},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competitor","offset":1224},{"uri":"Ford_F-Series","surface_form":"Ford Raptor","offset":1242},{"uri":"V-6_engine","surface_form":"V-6 engine","offset":1387},{"uri":"Horsepower","surface_form":"horsepower","offset":1413},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":1443},{"uri":"Mileage","surface_form":"mpg","offset":1479},{"uri":"V-8_engine","surface_form":"V-8 engine","offset":1512},{"uri":"Chrysler_Hemi_engine","surface_form":"5.7-liter HEMI","offset":1528}]}
