{"id":527637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting","text":"The lighting system of a motor vehicle consists of lighting and signalling devices mounted on the front, rear, sides, and in some cases on the top of a motor vehicle, and lights the roadway for the driver. The lighting system also makes the vehicle more visible, especially in low light conditions. It gives warning to other drivers and pedestrians of a vehicle's presence and direction of travel. Emergency vehicles usually carry distinctive lighting equipment to alert drivers and pedestrians of their rapid movement during an emergency.\nHistory.\nVehicles have had lights for well over a hundred years. Candles lit Horse-drawn carriages. The first cars, then called \"horseless-carriages\" were lit by gas lights. By 1908 electric lighting began to be used on motor vehicles. Red tail lights and yellow brake lights were in use by 1915. Sealed beam headlights were used starting in 1936. By 1940 turn signals were used. Before 1939, headlight design was not standardised. Between 1940 and 1956, all vehicles built in the U.S. were required to have 7\u2019\u2019 round headlights (sealed beams). As of 1956 and up, it became possible to install 4 headlights on 1 vehicle (2 lights per 1 side). In 1960 the first halogen lights were used on European cars and the technology came to the US by 1979. Replaceable car light bulbs were in use in the US beginning in 1983.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":51},{"uri":"Signal","surface_form":"signal","offset":64},{"uri":"Motor_vehicle","surface_form":"motor vehicle","offset":152},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":182},{"uri":"Driver","surface_form":"driver","offset":198},{"uri":"Visibility","surface_form":"visible","offset":254},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":281},{"uri":"Pedestrian","surface_form":"pedestrian","offset":337},{"uri":"Emergency_vehicle_lighting","surface_form":"Emergency vehicles","offset":398},{"uri":"Candle","surface_form":"Candle","offset":605},{"uri":"Horse-drawn_carriage","surface_form":"Horse-drawn carriage","offset":617},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":650},{"uri":"Gas_lighting","surface_form":"gas lights","offset":702},{"uri":"Electric_light","surface_form":"electric light","offset":722},{"uri":"Motor_vehicles","surface_form":"motor vehicles","offset":760},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"Red","offset":776},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":796},{"uri":"Brake","surface_form":"brake","offset":803},{"uri":"Halogen","surface_form":"halogen","offset":1201},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1229}]}
