{"id":527671,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property","text":"e=\"preserve\">Distribution is a concept from algebra: It tells how binary operations are to be handled. The most simple case is that of addition and multiplication of numbers.\nIn the left-hand side of the first equation, the 2 multiplies the sum of 1 and 3; on the right-hand side, it multiplies the 1 and the 3 individually, with the products added afterwards.\nBecause these give the same final answer (8), it is said that multiplication by 2 \"distributes\" over addition of 1 and 3.\nSince one could have put any real numbers in place of 2, 1, and 3 above, and still have obtained a true equation, we say that multiplication of real numbers \"distributes\" over addition of real numbers.\nDefinition.\n\u2217 is \"left-distributive\" over + if, given any elements, and of,\n\u2217 is \"right-distributive\" over + if, given any elements, and of,\n\u2217 is \"distributive\" over + if it is left- and right-distributive.\nNotice that when \u2217 is commutative, the three conditions above are logically equivalent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":44},{"uri":"Binary_operation","surface_form":"binary operation","offset":66},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":135},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":148},{"uri":"Numbers","surface_form":"numbers","offset":166},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":512},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":609},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":659},{"uri":"Given_any","surface_form":"given any","offset":733},{"uri":"Commutative","surface_form":"commutative","offset":914},{"uri":"Logical_equivalence","surface_form":"logically equivalent","offset":958}]}
