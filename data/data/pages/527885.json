{"id":527885,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_kingbird","text":"The tropical kingbird (\"Tyrannus melancholicus\") is a large tyrant flycatcher. This bird breeds from southern Arizona and the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States through Central America, South America as far as south as central Argentina and western Peru, and on Trinidad and Tobago. Birds from the northernmost and southern breeding areas migrate to warmer parts of the range after breeding.\nDescription and ecology.\nAn adult tropical kingbird is long and weighs. The head is pale gray, with a darker eye mask (area around its eyes), an orange crown stripe, and a heavy gray bill. The back is grayish-green, and the wing and forked tail are brown. The throat is pale gray, becoming olive-colored on the breast, with the rest of the underparts being yellow. Both male and female are similar, but young birds have pale buff edges on the wing coverts.\nThe call is a high-pitched twittering trill, \"tree-e-e-e-e-e-e\", with a more complex version sung by the male at dawn.\nTheir breeding habitat is semi-open areas with trees and shrubs, including gardens and roadsides. Tropical kingbirds like to view their surroundings from an open perch, usually high in a tree. They take long flights to catch insects in mid-air, which is called hawking. They sometimes hover to pick food off of plants, which is called gleaning. They also eat some fruit.\nThese birds will defend their territory against intruders, even much larger birds such as toucans, caracaras or hawks.\nThey make a flimsy cup nest in a tree. The eggs are cream-colored with reddish-brown marks. The female incubates the typical clutch of two or three eggs for 16 days. After they hatch, it is about 18\u201319 more days until fledging.\nThe tropical kingbird is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. This is because this bird is very common and they adapt well to changes in their environment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tyrant_flycatcher","surface_form":"tyrant flycatcher","offset":60},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":110},{"uri":"Rio_Grande_Valley","surface_form":"Rio Grande Valley","offset":132},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":153},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":188},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":205},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":246},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":268},{"uri":"Trinidad_and_Tobago","surface_form":"Trinidad and Tobago","offset":281},{"uri":"Migrate","surface_form":"migrate","offset":358},{"uri":"Olive_(color)","surface_form":"olive-colored","offset":701},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":1212},{"uri":"Hawking_(birds)","surface_form":"hawking","offset":1248},{"uri":"Gleaning_(birds)","surface_form":"gleaning","offset":1322},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1351},{"uri":"Toucan","surface_form":"toucan","offset":1448},{"uri":"Caracara","surface_form":"caracara","offset":1457},{"uri":"Hawk","surface_form":"hawk","offset":1470},{"uri":"Cup_nest","surface_form":"cup nest","offset":1496},{"uri":"Incubate","surface_form":"incubate","offset":1580},{"uri":"Fledge","surface_form":"fledging","offset":1695},{"uri":"IUCN","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":1773}]}
