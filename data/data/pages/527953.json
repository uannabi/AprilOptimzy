He was the winner of the Fermat Prize and the Langevin Prize in mathematics. He was a professor of mathematics at Rutgers University.\nHe mainly studied the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and differential geometry. He introduced the method of the critical points at infinity, which is a fundamental step in the calculus of variations.\nOn 10 January 2016, he died following a long illness at the age of 61.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":53},{"uri":"Fermat_Prize","surface_form":"Fermat Prize","offset":102},{"uri":"Rutgers_University","surface_form":"Rutgers University","offset":191},{"uri":"Calculus_of_variations","surface_form":"calculus of variations","offset":233},{"uri":"Partial_differential_equation","surface_form":"partial differential equation","offset":257},{"uri":"Differential_geometry","surface_form":"differential geometry","offset":293}]}
