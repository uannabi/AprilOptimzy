{"id":527989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_Party","text":"The Prohibition Party (PRO) is a political party in the United States. The party is known for its historic opposition to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages.\nIt is the oldest existing third party in the United States. The party was an important part of the temperance movement. While never one of the leading parties in the United States, it was once an important force in the Third Party System during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This was also the case in mid century Europe. It declined dramatically after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.\nThe party earned only 519 votes in the 2012 presidential election with Jack Fellure as the candidate. James Hedges was the candidate in the 2016 presidential election winning 5,617 votes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":33},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":56},{"uri":"Alcoholic_beverage","surface_form":"alcoholic beverage","offset":148},{"uri":"Third_party_(United_States)","surface_form":"third party","offset":195},{"uri":"Temperance_movement","surface_form":"temperance movement","offset":268},{"uri":"Third_Party_System","surface_form":"Third Party System","offset":388},{"uri":"Prohibition_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"Prohibition","offset":545},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2012","surface_form":"2012 presidential election","offset":605},{"uri":"Jack_Fellure","surface_form":"Jack Fellure","offset":637},{"uri":"James_Hedges","surface_form":"James Hedges","offset":668},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016 presidential election","offset":706}]}
