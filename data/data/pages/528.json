{"id":528,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number","text":"Numbers are also used for other things like counting. Numbers are used when things are measured. Numbers are used to study how the world works. Mathematics is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things. The study of the rules of the natural world is called science. The work that uses numbers to make things is called engineering.\nNumbers for people.\nThere are different ways of giving symbols to numbers. These methods are called number systems. The most common number system that people use is the \"base ten\" number system. The \"base ten\" number system is also called the decimal number system. The base ten number system is common because people have ten fingers and ten toes. There are 10 different symbols used in the base ten number system. These ten symbols are called digits.\nA symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits. The position of the digits shows how big the number is. For example, the number 23 in the decimal number system really means (2 times 10) plus 3. Similarly, 101 means 1 times a hundred (=100) plus 0 times 10 (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1).\nNumbers for machines.\nAnother number system is more common for machines. The machine number system is called the \"binary\" number system. The binary number system is also called the base two number system. There are two different symbols (0 and 1) used in the base two number system. These two symbols are called bits.\nA symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols. The position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is. For example, the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0, and 101 means 1 times four (=4) plus 0 times two (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1). The binary number 10 is the same as the decimal number 2. The binary number 101 is the same as the decimal number 5.\nNames of numbers.\nWhen dealing with larger numbers than this, there are two different ways of naming the numbers in English. Under the \"long scale\", a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number. It is also called the \"British Standard\". This scale used to be common in Britain, but is not often used in English-speaking countries today. It is still used in some other European nations.\nAnother scale is the \"short scale\", under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number. This scale is a lot more common in most English-speaking nations today.\nA salamander is not a number; it is an amphibian.\nNatural numbers.\nNatural numbers are the numbers which we normally use for counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. Some people say that 0 is a natural number, too. The set of all natural numbers is written as formula_1.\nAnother name for these numbers is positive numbers. These numbers are sometimes written as +1 to show that they are different from the negative numbers. But not all positive numbers are natural (for example, formula_1 is positive, but not natural).\nIf 0 is called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the whole numbers. If 0 is not called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the counting numbers. So if the words \"natural numbers\" are not used, then there will be less confusion about whether zero is included or not. But unfortunately, some say that zero is not a whole number, while others say that whole numbers can be negative. \"Positive integers\" and \"non-negative integers\" are another way to include zero or exclude zero, but only if people know those words.\nNegative numbers.\nNegative numbers are numbers less than zero.\nOne way to think of negative numbers is to use a \"number line\". We call one point on this line zero. Then we will label (write the name of) every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point is. For example, the point one is one centimeter to the right, and the point two is two centimeters to the right.\nHowever, the point one centimeter to the left of the zero point cannot be point one, since there is already a point called one. We therefore call this point minus one (\u22121, as it is one centimeter away but in the opposite direction).\nA drawing of a number line is below.\nSince finding the square root of a negative number is impossible for real numbers (as negative times negative equals positive for real numbers), the square root of -1 is given a special name: \"i\". This is also called the imaginary unit.\nIntegers.\nIntegers are all the natural numbers, all their opposites, and the number zero. Decimal numbers and fractions are not integers.\nRational numbers.\nRational numbers are numbers which can be written as fractions. This means that they can be written as \"a\" divided by \"b\", where the numbers \"a\" and \"b\" are integers, and \"b\" is not zero.\nSome rational numbers, such as 1/10, need a finite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form. The number one tenth is written in decimal form as 0.1. Numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational. Some rational numbers, such as 1/11, need an infinite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form. There is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point. The number one eleventh is written in decimal form as 0.0909090909....\nA percentage could be called a rational number, because a percentage like 7% can be written as the fraction 7/100. It can also be written as the decimal 0.07. Sometimes, a ratio is considered as a rational number.\nIrrational numbers.\nIrrational numbers are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction, but do not have imaginary parts (explained later).\nIrrational numbers often occur in geometry. For example, if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two, which equals 1.414213.... This is an irrational number. Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.\nOne well-known irrational number is pi. This is the circumference (distance around) of a circle divided by its diameter (distance across). This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.1415926535....\nAn irrational number cannot be fully written down in decimal form. It would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point, and unlike 0.333333..., these digits would not repeat forever.\nReal numbers.\nThe real numbers form the real line. This is all the numbers that do not involve imaginary numbers.\nImaginary numbers.\nImaginary numbers are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number \"i\". This number is the square root of minus one (\u22121).\nThere is no number in the real numbers which when squared, makes the number \u22121. Therefore, mathematicians invented a number. They called this number i, or the imaginary unit.\nImaginary numbers were called \"imaginary\" because when they were first found, many mathematicians did not think they existed. The person who \"discovered\" imaginary numbers was Gerolamo Cardano in the 1500s. The first to use the words \"imaginary number\" was Ren\u00E9 Descartes. The first people to use these numbers were Leonard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Both lived in the 18th century.\nComplex numbers.\nComplex numbers are numbers which have two parts; a \"real\" part and an \"imaginary\" part. Every type of number written above is also a complex number.\nComplex numbers are a more general form of numbers. The complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane. This is composed of a real number line, and an imaginary number line.\n3i|_\n2i|_. 2+2i\ni|_\n\u22122 \u22121 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\u2212i|_.3\u2212i\n.\u22122\u22122i \u22122i|_\n\u22123i|_\nTo multiply two complex numbers is more complicated. It is easiest to describe in general terms, with two complex numbers a + bi and c + di.\nformula_1\nFor example, (4 + 5i) \u00D7 (3 + 2i) = (4 \u00D7 3 \u2212 5 \u00D7 2) + (4 \u00D7 2 + 5 \u00D7 3)i = (12 \u2212 10) + (8 + 15)i = 2 + 23i.\nTranscendental numbers.\nA real or complex number is called a \"transcendental number\" if it can not be obtained as a result of an algebraic equation with integer coefficients.\nformula_1\nProving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult. Each transcendental number is also an irrational number. The first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Leonhard Euler. The first to actually prove there were transcendental numbers was Joseph Liouville. He did this in 1844.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Measure","surface_form":"measure","offset":87},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"Mathematics","offset":144},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":276},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":337},{"uri":"Numeral_system","surface_form":"number systems","offset":450},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal number system","offset":593},{"uri":"Finger","surface_form":"finger","offset":677},{"uri":"Toe","surface_form":"toe","offset":693},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":1103},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":1205},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"Natural number","offset":2532},{"uri":"Positive_numbers","surface_form":"positive numbers","offset":2775},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"Negative number","offset":3570},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":4226},{"uri":"Imaginary_unit","surface_form":"imaginary unit","offset":4429},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"Integer","offset":4455},{"uri":"Opposite_number","surface_form":"opposites","offset":4503},{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":4529},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"Decimal numbers","offset":4535},{"uri":"Rational_number","surface_form":"Rational number","offset":4601},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fractions","offset":4654},{"uri":"Finite","surface_form":"finite","offset":4833},{"uri":"Decimal_point","surface_form":"decimal point","offset":4867},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal","offset":4898},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":5070},{"uri":"0.0909090909","surface_form":"0.0909090909","offset":5277},{"uri":"Percentage","surface_form":"percentage","offset":5296},{"uri":"Ratio","surface_form":"ratio","offset":5466},{"uri":"Irrational_numbers","surface_form":"Irrational numbers","offset":5528},{"uri":"Imaginary_numbers","surface_form":"imaginary","offset":5614},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":5683},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":5799},{"uri":"Mathematical_proof","surface_form":"proved","offset":5895},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":5911},{"uri":"Pi_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"pi","offset":6029},{"uri":"Circumference","surface_form":"circumference","offset":6045},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":6104},{"uri":"Decimal","surface_form":"decimal","offset":6275},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":6306},{"uri":"Imaginary_number","surface_form":"Imaginary number","offset":6553},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":6647},{"uri":"Squared","surface_form":"squared","offset":6728},{"uri":"Gerolamo_Cardano","surface_form":"Gerolamo Cardano","offset":7029},{"uri":"Ren%C3%A9_Descartes","surface_form":"Ren\u00E9 Descartes","offset":7110},{"uri":"Leonard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonard Euler","offset":7169},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gauss","offset":7187},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":7227},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"Complex number","offset":7258},{"uri":"Transcendental_number","surface_form":"transcendental number","offset":7968},{"uri":"Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","surface_form":"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz","offset":8292},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonhard Euler","offset":8322},{"uri":"Joseph_Liouville","surface_form":"Joseph Liouville","offset":8404},{"uri":"1844","surface_form":"1844","offset":8437}]}
