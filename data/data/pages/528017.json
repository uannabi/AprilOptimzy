He was born in Rostov-on-Don.\nBukavshin died in Tolyatti on 12 January 2016. He was originally thought to have suffered a stroke. Now it is reported that a massive overdose (or poisoning) of Drotaverine caused his death. It is possible that the reports are consistent, because the overdose might have caused the stroke.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":69},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":77},{"uri":"Grandmaster_(chess)","surface_form":"Grandmaster","offset":83},{"uri":"European_Youth_Chess_Championship","surface_form":"European Youth Champion","offset":201},{"uri":"Rostov-on-Don","surface_form":"Rostov-on-Don","offset":283},{"uri":"Tolyatti","surface_form":"Tolyatti","offset":316},{"uri":"Drotaverine","surface_form":"Drotaverine","offset":459}]}
