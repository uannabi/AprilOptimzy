{"id":52820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing","text":"e=\"preserve\">Signal processing is the analysis, interpretation and manipulation of signals. Signals of interest include sound, images, biological signals such as ECG, radar signals, and many others.\nProcessing of such signals includes storage and reconstruction, separation of information from noise (e.g., aircraft identification by radar), compression (e.g., image compression), and feature extraction (e.g., converting text to speech).\nSignal classification.\nFor analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunication. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error checking and error detection of digital signals.\nMethod of Signal processing.\nSignal processing is the analysis, interpretation and manipulation of acquired signals. Acquired signals must to be processed depending on the purpose of measurement, a method of measurement, and a property of acquired signals.\nWhen signals are processed, statistics is used because it's essential to know a distribution of data and represent data by numerical formulas. In other words, to study signal processing, it's demanded to study statistics (like the theory of error, the arithmetical mean, probability, a stochastic variable, accuracy, and detailed drawing, etc.).\nIn most cases, signals are regular, as it is acquired from electric instruments like telemeter, or communications equipment, etc. But there are also many accidentally occurred irregular signals which make it difficult to find formulas that fit exactly. Here, the irregular means it's hard to predict the result which is not yet occurred. When irregular signals are acquired, photon is necessary, so it is measured, and calculated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":38},{"uri":"Interpretation","surface_form":"interpretation","offset":48},{"uri":"Manipulation","surface_form":"manipulation","offset":67},{"uri":"Digital_signal_processing","surface_form":"sound","offset":120},{"uri":"Image_processing","surface_form":"images","offset":127},{"uri":"ECG","surface_form":"ECG","offset":162},{"uri":"Radar","surface_form":"radar","offset":167},{"uri":"Storage","surface_form":"storage","offset":235},{"uri":"Reconstruction","surface_form":"reconstruction","offset":247},{"uri":"Noise","surface_form":"noise","offset":294},{"uri":"Data_compression","surface_form":"compression","offset":342},{"uri":"Image_processing","surface_form":"image compression","offset":361},{"uri":"Text_to_Speech","surface_form":"text to speech","offset":422},{"uri":"Amplification","surface_form":"amplification","offset":516},{"uri":"Filter","surface_form":"filter","offset":534},{"uri":"Telecommunication","surface_form":"telecommunication","offset":631},{"uri":"Compression","surface_form":"compression","offset":705}]}
