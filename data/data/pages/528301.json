{"id":528301,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect","text":"The butterfly effect is an idea that is more commonly used in chaos theory. A small change can make much bigger changes happen; one small incident can have a big impact on the future. The idea started from weather prediction. Now the term is used for many things; some are scientific, and some are not.\nThe term butterfly effect comes from an analogy where a butterfly flaps its wings in Tokyo and a tornado occurs in Tennessee. Weather is hard to forecast, because small changes like this can have a big impact on the weather.\nThis term can be used in areas other than weather. Here a small change can also have a large impact. For example, it\u2019s one reason why many people believe time travel to be dangerous. If a small change was made to history, that could have a very bad impact later on. Author Ray Bradbury wrote the short story \"A Sound of Thunder\" with this idea\u2014time travelers make a very small change in the past that makes a large change in the present.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":206},{"uri":"Prediction","surface_form":"prediction","offset":214},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific","offset":273},{"uri":"Analogy","surface_form":"analogy","offset":343},{"uri":"Ray_Bradbury","surface_form":"Ray Bradbury","offset":801},{"uri":"A_Sound_of_Thunder","surface_form":"A Sound of Thunder","offset":837}]}
