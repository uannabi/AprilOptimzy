{"id":52835,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rond%C3%B4nia","text":"Rond\u00F4nia is a state in Brazil. It is in the northwest of the country. To the west is the state of Acre. To the north is the state of Amazonas. In the east is Mato Grosso. In the south is Bolivia. Its capital is Porto Velho. The state was named after Candido Rondon.\nGeography.\nThe state is covered mostly by jungle of the Amazon Rainforest. About three-fifths of the state has had the jungle removed since the 1970s. Most of the people living in the state now live in urban areas. It is a big exporter of wood. The state also makes both coffee and cocoa. The breeding of cattle is also important here.\nFlag.\nThe flag was made by Silvio Carvalho Feitosa. It was made the flag of the state on December 22, 1981. The flag uses the same colors of the flag of Brazil. The big star in the middle of the flag is a symbol for the new state. The star is shown rising into the blue sky that is stretching over Brazil (the yellow and green areas in the lower half of the flag).\nTribes.\nThe Akuntsu tribe is one of the tribes of Rond\u00F4nia. They are one of the indigenous peoples of Brazil. They were first contacted in only 1995. At that time, there were only seven people in the tribe. As of 2006, there were six people. They live in the Igarape Omere region to the southwest of Rond\u00F4nia. The tribe consists of chief Kunibu Baba (male, age: ~ 70), Pupak (male, age: ~ 40), Ururu (female, age:~80) and three women with ages from 23-35. The seventh member of the tribe died in 1995. The only child born after that died in 2000 in a storm. With his death the only hope of the tribe not becoming extinct lessened.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"States_of_Brazil","surface_form":"state","offset":14},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":23},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":61},{"uri":"Acre_(state)","surface_form":"Acre","offset":98},{"uri":"Amazonas%2C_Brazil","surface_form":"Amazonas","offset":133},{"uri":"Mato_Grosso","surface_form":"Mato Grosso","offset":158},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":187},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":200},{"uri":"Porto_Velho","surface_form":"Porto Velho","offset":211},{"uri":"Candido_Rondon","surface_form":"Candido Rondon","offset":250},{"uri":"Jungle","surface_form":"jungle","offset":308},{"uri":"Amazon_Rainforest","surface_form":"Amazon Rainforest","offset":322},{"uri":"Urban","surface_form":"urban","offset":468},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"export","offset":493},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":505},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":537},{"uri":"Cocoa","surface_form":"cocoa","offset":548},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":559},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":571},{"uri":"December_22","surface_form":"December 22","offset":691},{"uri":"1981","surface_form":"1981","offset":704},{"uri":"Flag_of_Brazil","surface_form":"flag of Brazil","offset":747},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":872},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":987},{"uri":"Indigenous_people","surface_form":"indigenous people","offset":1047},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":1111},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1180},{"uri":"Igarape_Omere","surface_form":"Igarape Omere","offset":1226},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":1240},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":1580}]}
