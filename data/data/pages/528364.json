At the time of its release, some found the lyrics objectionable.\nAt the beginning of the song, two girls are talking. One says: \"Oh my God, Becky. Look at her butt!\"\nThe video of the song was banned by MTV for a short time.\nThe song was #1 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nIn late January 2013, a preview of the show \"Glee\" included a cover of \"Baby Got Back\". Jonathan Coulton claimed \"Glee\" copied his version of the song.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hip_hop","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":39},{"uri":"Sir_Mix-A-Lot","surface_form":"Sir Mix-A-Lot","offset":55},{"uri":"Buttocks","surface_form":"buttocks","offset":107},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"video","offset":287},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV","offset":319},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":364},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":369},{"uri":"Glee","surface_form":"Glee","offset":435}]}
