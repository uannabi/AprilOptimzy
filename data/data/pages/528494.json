{"id":528494,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen","text":"Thomas Newcomen (February 1664 \u2013 5 August 1729) was an English inventor. He made the first practical steam engine for pumping water, the Newcomen steam engine.\nNewcomen was an ironmonger and a Baptist lay preacher. He was born in Dartmouth, Devon, England, to a merchant family and baptised at St. Saviour's Church on 24 February 1664.\nFlooding in coal and tin mines was a large problem. Newcomen was trying to improve ways to pump out the water from the mines. His ironmonger's business specialised in tools for the mining industry.\nHis first engine was not very efficient, and used a lot of coal. The Watt steam engine, was much more fuel efficient. Watt and his partner Matthew Boulton got substantial royalties because their machines saved so much on fuel bills.\nSurviving Newcomen engines.\nThere are examples of Newcomen engines in the Science Museum (London) and the Ford Museum, Dearborn, Michigan.\nPerhaps the last Newcomen-style engine to be used commercially \u2013 and the last still on its original site \u2013 is at the Elsecar Heritage Centre, near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. Newcomen engines that can be seen working are the Newcomen Memorial Engine at Dartmouth and the replica engine at the Black Country Museum in Dudley, West Midlands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ironmonger","surface_form":"ironmonger","offset":176},{"uri":"Baptist","surface_form":"Baptist","offset":193},{"uri":"Lay_preacher","surface_form":"lay preacher","offset":201},{"uri":"Dartmouth%2C_Devon","surface_form":"Dartmouth, Devon","offset":230},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchant","offset":262},{"uri":"Baptised","surface_form":"baptised","offset":282},{"uri":"Coal_mine","surface_form":"coal","offset":348},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":357},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":593},{"uri":"Watt_steam_engine","surface_form":"Watt steam engine","offset":603},{"uri":"James_Watt","surface_form":"Watt","offset":652},{"uri":"Matthew_Boulton","surface_form":"Matthew Boulton","offset":673},{"uri":"Royalties","surface_form":"royalties","offset":705},{"uri":"Science_Museum_(London)","surface_form":"Science Museum (London)","offset":841},{"uri":"The_Henry_Ford","surface_form":"Ford Museum","offset":873},{"uri":"Dearborn%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Dearborn, Michigan","offset":886},{"uri":"Elsecar_Heritage_Centre","surface_form":"Elsecar Heritage Centre","offset":1023},{"uri":"Barnsley","surface_form":"Barnsley","offset":1053},{"uri":"South_Yorkshire","surface_form":"South Yorkshire","offset":1065},{"uri":"Dartmouth","surface_form":"Dartmouth","offset":1160},{"uri":"Black_Country_Museum","surface_form":"Black Country Museum","offset":1200},{"uri":"Dudley","surface_form":"Dudley","offset":1224},{"uri":"West_Midlands","surface_form":"West Midlands","offset":1232}]}
