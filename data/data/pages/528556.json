{"id":528556,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_H%C3%B6ss","text":"Rudolf Franz Ferdinand H\u00F6ss (also spelled H\u00F6\u00DF, Hoe\u00DF, or Hoess) (25 November 1900 \u2013 16 April 1947) was a high-ranking member of the Nazi \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) during World War II. He was in charge of Auschwitz concentration camp for about four years.\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, decided to exterminate (kill all of) the Jewish people in Europe. They called this plan the \"Final Solution\". The Nazis also sent many other people to concentration camps and extermination camps (death camps). As Commandant (commander) at Auschwitz, H\u00F6ss tested and started using different ways of killing these people more quickly. He started using Zyklon B, a pesticide with hydrogen cyanide in it, to kill prisoners in gas chambers. This allowed Nazi soldiers at Auschwitz to murder 2,000 people every hour. At Auschwitz, he created the largest place meant for the constant mass murder of human beings ever known in history.\nH\u00F6ss joined the Nazi Party in 1922, and joined the SS in 1934. From 4 May 1940 to November 1943, and again from 8 May 1944 to 18 January 1945, he was in charge of Auschwitz. Before Nazi Germany lost World War II, more than a million people were murdered at Auschwitz. H\u00F6ss was hanged in 1947 after he was found guilty at a trial in Warsaw, Poland.\nLife.\nH\u00F6ss was born in Baden-Baden, Germany, on 25 November 1900. His parents were Franz Xaver H\u00F6ss and Lina H\u00F6ss. He was the oldest of three children, and was the only son. H\u00F6ss's family was very Catholic.\nIn his autobiography, H\u00F6ss said that he was briefly kidnapped by Gypsies when he was a child.\nH\u00F6ss's father was a former German army officer who had served in German East Africa (a German colony that included what are now Burundi, Rwanda, and part of Tanzania). After leaving the army, he ran a tea and coffee business. He brought up his son based on strict Catholic beliefs, and with military discipline. He had decided that H\u00F6ss would become a Catholic priest. During H\u00F6ss's early childhood, he was constantly being told about sin, guilt, and the need to do penance.\nH\u00F6ss began turning against religion as a young teenager. This happened after he gave a confession to a priest (he told the priest what he had done wrong). In Catholicism, the \"Seal of the Confessional\" is supposed to be unbreakable. This means a priest is never supposed to tell anyone what someone has said in a confession. H\u00F6ss said he started to dislike religion when the priest told H\u00F6ss's father about something H\u00F6ss had said in a confession. Soon after this, H\u00F6ss's father died, and H\u00F6ss began moving toward a military life.\nWhen World War I started, H\u00F6ss served briefly in a military hospital. Then, at age 14, he was allowed to join his father's and grandfather's old regiment, the German Army's 21st Regiment of Dragoons. At age 15, he fought with the Ottoman Sixth Army at Baghdad, at Kut-el-Amara, and in Palestine. While stationed in Turkey, he rose to the rank of ' (sergeant). At age 17, he was the youngest non-commissioned officer in the German Army. While in the Army, he was injured three times and got malaria. He was awarded the Ottoman Empire's Gallipoli Star, the Iron Cross first and second class, and other decorations.\nNazi career.\nAfter Germany surrendered in November 1918, H\u00F6ss finished high school. Soon, he joined the nationalist paramilitary groups that were forming. First, he joined the East Prussian Volunteer Corps. Then he joined the ' in the countries around the Baltic Sea, Silesia, and the Ruhr. H\u00F6ss participated in the armed terror attacks on Polish people during the Silesian Uprisings (when the Polish people tried to break away from German control). He also participated in terror attacks on French nationals during the Occupation of the Ruhr (when the Ruhr valley in Germany was occupied by France and Belgium).\nH\u00F6ss joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing Adolf Hitler's speech in Munich. H\u00F6ss led at least one political assassination, and spent six years in jail for it.\nOn 31 May 1923, in Mecklenburg, Germany, H\u00F6ss and members of the \"Freikorps\" (German volunteer soldiers) beat to death a local schoolteacher named Walther Kadow. They did this because Martin Bormann wanted them to. Bormann later became Hitler's private secretary. Bormann thought that Kadow had told the French occupational government Nazi soldier Albert Leo Schlageter was sabotaging French supply lines. Schlageter was arrested and executed on 26 May 1923. Soon afterward, H\u00F6ss and several accomplices, including Bormann, killed Kadow out of revenge. In 1923, after one of the killers confessed to a local newspaper, H\u00F6ss was arrested and tried as the leader of the murder. H\u00F6ss later said than another man was actually in charge, but at the time, H\u00F6ss accepted the blame as the group's leader. He was convicted and sentenced (on 15 or 17 May 1924). His sentence was for 10 years in Brandenburg Penitentiary (prison). Bormann was sentenced to one year in prison.\nH\u00F6ss was released in July 1928 as part of a general amnesty. He joined the ' (\"Artaman League\"), a nationalist \"back-to-the-land\" movement that supported clean, farm living.\nOn 17 August 1929, H\u00F6ss married Hedwig Hensel (3 March 1908 \u2013 1989), whom he met in the Artaman League. Between 1930 and 1943, they had five children: two sons (Klaus and Hans-Rudolf) and three daughters (Ingebrigitt, Heidetraut, and Annegret).\nJoining the SS.\nH\u00F6ss became a member of the SS on 1 April 1934, when Heinrich Himmler encouraged all Nazi men to join the SS. H\u00F6ss joined the \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00E4nde\" (Death's Head Units) in the same year. He came to admire Himmler so much that he thought whatever Himmler said was \"gospel.\" He even preferred to display Himmler's picture in his office instead of Hitler's.\nH\u00F6ss was assigned to the Dachau concentration camp in December 1934. There, he where he held the post of \"Blockf\u00FChrer\" (\"Block Leader\"), meaning he was in charge of one barracks of prisoners. In 1938, H\u00F6ss was promoted to \"SS-Hauptsturmf\u00FChrer\" (Captain), and was made an assistant to Hermann Baranowski in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.\nH\u00F6ss joined the Waffen-SS in 1939 after Nazi Germany invaded Poland. H\u00F6ss was good at his job, and his bosses suggested that he should be promoted (given a better job). By the end of his tour of duty there, H\u00F6ss was in charge of prisoners' belongings.\nAuschwitz command.\nOn 1 May 1940, H\u00F6ss was appointed commandant of Auschwitz, which was a combination of concentration camps and an extermination camp. H\u00F6ss commanded the camp for three and a half years. During this time, he changed the original camp into a huge complex (group of camps) called Auschwitz-Birkenau. H\u00F6ss went to Auschwitz determined \"to do things differently\" and develop a more efficient camp than the camps at Dachau and Sachsenhausen where he had worked before. H\u00F6ss lived at Auschwitz in a villa with his wife and five children.\nThe earliest inmates at Auschwitz were Soviet prisoners of war and Polish prisoners, including peasants and intellectuals. About 700 of these prisoners arrived at Auschwitz in June 1940; the Nazi guards told them they would not survive more than 3 months.\nThere were also many smaller \"sub-camps\" nearby. The Auschwitz complex was built on about 8,000\u00A0hectares (20,000\u00A0acres) that had been cleared of everyone who lived there.\nIn June 1941, H\u00F6ss met with SS Commander Heinrich Himmler in Berlin. Himmler told H\u00F6ss that Hitler had given the order for the \"Final Solution\" - to kill all of the Jewish people. Himmler had chosen Auschwitz as the place where Europe's Jews would be exterminated. He chose Auschwitz \"[because] of its easy access by rail [train] and also because the extensive site offered space for measures ensuring isolation.\" This meant that Auschwitz was big enough that the genocide of the Jews could be kept secret. Himmler described the project as a \"secret Reich matter.\" H\u00F6ss later said that \"no one was allowed to speak about these matters with any person and that everyone promised upon his life to keep the utmost secrecy.\"\nH\u00F6ss began testing and perfecting mass murder techniques on 3 September 1941. His experiments made Auschwitz the camp that would kill the most prisoners during the Holocaust. H\u00F6ss later said that, during a regular day at Auschwitz, two to three trains carrying 2,000 prisoners each would arrive every day for periods of four to six weeks. The prisoners were unloaded in the Birkenau death camp. Prisoners who were strong, healthy, and able to work were marched to barracks in either Birkenau or one of the other Auschwitz camps. Prisoners who were elderly, very young, sick, or unable to do forced labor were killed in gas chambers, which were disguised as showers. At first, small gassing bunkers were located deep in the woods, to keep them secret. Later, four large gas chambers and crematoria were built in Birkenau to make it easier for the Nazis to kill more people, more quickly.\nH\u00F6ss experimented with different poison gases. At first, he used cotton filters soaked in sulfuric acid. H\u00F6ss later started using hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), made from the pesticide Zyklon B, after his deputy Karl Fritzsch tested it on a group of Russian prisoners in 1941. H\u00F6ss said that when he used Zyklon B, it took 3\u201315 minutes for prisoners to die, and that \"we knew when the people were dead because they stopped screaming.\"\nAfter Auschwitz.\nOn 10 November 1943, Arthur Liebehenschel became the Commandant at Auschwitz. H\u00F6ss took over Liebehenschel's last job as the chairman of \"Amt D I\"\u00A0in \"Amtsgruppe D\" of the \"SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt\" (WVHA), which ran the concentration camps. H\u00F6ss also was made the deputy (assistant) of Richard Gl\u00FCcks, the inspector of all of the concentration camps.\nOn 8 May 1944, H\u00F6ss returned to Auschwitz to supervise operation \"Aktion H\u00F6ss.\" In \"Aktion H\u00F6ss,\" 430,000 Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz and killed in 56 days. Even the huge facility that H\u00F6ss had built could not handle the huge number of victims' corpses. The camp's staff had to burn thousands of bodies in open fire pits.\nCapture, trial, and execution.\nIn the last days of the war, Himmler told H\u00F6ss to disguise himself among German Navy sailors. H\u00F6ss avoided arrest for nearly a year. When he was captured by British soldiers on 11 March 1946 in Gottrupel, he was disguised as a gardener and called himself Franz Lang. His wife, who feared that her son, Klaus, would be shipped off to the Soviet Union to be imprisoned or tortured, had told the British where H\u00F6ss was. The British soldiers that captured H\u00F6ss were led by Hanns Alexander, a young Jewish man from Berlin who was forced to flee to England with his entire family during the rise of Nazi Germany. H\u00F6ss initially denied who he was, until Alexander noticed his wedding ring and demanded to see it. H\u00F6ss refused to remove it, saying it was stuck on his finger. But when Alexander threatened to cut his finger off, H\u00F6ss removed the ring. It had the names \"Rudolf\" and \"Hedwig\" engraved inside. After being questioned and beaten with axe handles by the British soldiers, H\u00F6ss admitted who he really was.\nH\u00F6ss appeared at the Nuremberg Trials on 15 April 1946, where he explained his crimes in detail. Affidavits (sworn statements to the court) that Rudolf H\u00F6ss made while imprisoned in Nuremberg were also used at the Pohl and IG Farben trials.\nH\u00F6ss wrote his autobiography while awaiting execution. It was published in 1956 as \",\" and later as \"Death Dealer: the Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz\" (among other editions).\nShortly before his execution, H\u00F6ss returned to the Catholic Church. On 10 April 1947, he received the sacrament of penance from Friar W\u0142adys\u0142aw Lohn, S.J. On the next day, the same priest gave H\u00F6ss Holy Communion as Viaticum (the Eucharist given to a person who is dying).\nHandwritten confession.\nH\u00F6ss's original confession, with his signature, is displayed in a glass case in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Behind the confession is a photo showing Hungarian Jewish women and children walking to one of the four gas chambers in the Birkenau death camp on 26 May 1944.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["military
