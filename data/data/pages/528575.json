He was born in T\u00FCbingen, Germany.\nHe was best known for his works to the algebraic formulation of axiomatic quantum field theory, namely the Haag-Kastler axioms\n, and a central no-go theorem in QFT, Haag's theorem, which demonstrates the nonexistence of a unitary time-evolution operator in the interaction picture.\nIn 1965 he founded the journal Communications in Mathematical Physics, which he guided as Chief Editor for eight years.\nHe was awarded the Max Planck medal in 1970 and the Henri Poincar\u00E9 Prize of the International Association of Mathematical Physics in 1997.\nHaag died on 5 January 2016 at the age of 93.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":52},{"uri":"Theoretical_physicist","surface_form":"theoretical physicist","offset":59},{"uri":"T%C3%BCbingen","surface_form":"T\u00FCbingen","offset":97},{"uri":"Weimar_Republic","surface_form":"Germany","offset":107},{"uri":"Axiom","surface_form":"axiom","offset":180},{"uri":"Quantum_field_theory","surface_form":"quantum field theory","offset":190},{"uri":"Haag-Kastler_axioms","surface_form":"Haag-Kastler axioms","offset":223},{"uri":"No-go_theorem","surface_form":"no-go theorem","offset":259},{"uri":"Haag%27s_theorem","surface_form":"Haag's theorem","offset":281},{"uri":"Unitary_operator","surface_form":"unitary","offset":338},{"uri":"Time-evolution_operator","surface_form":"time-evolution operator","offset":346},{"uri":"Interaction_picture","surface_form":"interaction picture","offset":377},{"uri":"Communications_in_Mathematical_Physics","surface_form":"Communications in Mathematical Physics","offset":429},{"uri":"Max_Planck_medal","surface_form":"Max Planck medal","offset":537},{"uri":"Henri_Poincar%C3%A9_Prize","surface_form":"Henri Poincar\u00E9 Prize","offset":570},{"uri":"International_Association_of_Mathematical_Physics","surface_form":"International Association of Mathematical Physics","offset":598}]}
