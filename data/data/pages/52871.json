{"id":52871,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system","text":"The nervous system is a body system which sends signals around the body. It lets animals respond to what is around them. The \"central nervous system\" is the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves. It is present in almost all animals. It is there to process the input from the senses, and to to coordinate movement.\nThe nervous system is made up of neurons. Other cells, such as glial cells keep the neurons safe and healthy.\nThe structure of the system includes the brain and spinal cord, which together are called the \"central nervous system.\" The brain has billions of nerve cells to help think, walk, and breathe. The nervous system can react in 1/100 of a second to a stimulus, like a pain signal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":24},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":29},{"uri":"React","surface_form":"respond","offset":89},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":126},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":157},{"uri":"Spine","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":168},{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerve","offset":185},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":221},{"uri":"Senses","surface_form":"senses","offset":272},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"movement","offset":301},{"uri":"Neuron","surface_form":"neuron","offset":344},{"uri":"Glial_cell","surface_form":"glial cell","offset":374},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":555},{"uri":"Stimulus","surface_form":"stimulus","offset":668},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":685}]}
