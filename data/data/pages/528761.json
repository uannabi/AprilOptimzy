That is longer than any other Italian prime minister except Benito Mussolini, who was a dictator.\nDe Gasperi was born in Austria-Hungary, and did not become an Italian citizen until after the First World War. In 1927, he was put in prison for one and a half years because he did not support Mussolini's Fascist government. Mussolini released him from prison because the Pope asked him to.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":74},{"uri":"Council_of_Europe","surface_form":"Council of Europe","offset":160},{"uri":"European_Coal_and_Steel_Community","surface_form":"European Coal and Steel Community","offset":186},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Italy","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Italy","offset":232},{"uri":"Benito_Mussolini","surface_form":"Benito Mussolini","offset":356},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":384},{"uri":"Austria-Hungary","surface_form":"Austria-Hungary","offset":417},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":488},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":528},{"uri":"Fascist","surface_form":"Fascist","offset":599},{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Pope","offset":666}]}
