{"id":52906,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas%2C_fils","text":"Alexandre Dumas, fils (fils is French for \"son\"), (27 July 1824 \u2013 27 November 1895) was the son of Alexandre Dumas, p\u00E8re (p\u00E8re is French for \"father\"). Like his father, Alexandre Dumas, fils was a celebrated author and playwright.\nAlexandre Dumas \"fils\" was born in Paris, France, the illegitimate child of Marie-Catherine Labay, a dressmaker, and novelist Alexandre Dumas. In 1831 his father legally recognized him (he adopted him) and ensured the young Dumas received the best education possible at the Institution Goubaux and the College Bourbon. At that time, the law allowed the elder Dumas to take the child away from his mother. Her agony inspired Dumas \"fils\" to write about tragic female characters. In almost all of his writings, he emphasized the moral purpose of literature and in his 1858 play, \"Le fils naturel\" (\"The Illegitimate Son\"), he wrote about the belief that if a man fathers an illegitimate child, then he has an obligation to legitimize the child and marry the woman.\nDumas' paternal great-grandparents were a white French nobleman and a young black Haitian woman. In the boarding schools, Dumas \"fils\" was constantly taunted by his classmates. These issues all profoundly influenced his thoughts, behaviour, and writing.\nIn 1844, Dumas \"fils\" moved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye to live with his father. There, he met Marie Duplessis, a young courtesan who would be the inspiration for his romantic novel, \"La dame aux cam\u00E9lias\" (\"The Lady of the Camellias\"). Adapted into a play, it was titled in English (especially in the United States) as \"Camille\" and is the basis for Verdi's 1853 opera, \"La Traviata\". Although he admitted that he had done the adaptation because he needed the money, he had a huge success with the play. With this work began the playwriting career of Dumas \"fils\" which not only eclipsed that of his father during his lifetime but also dominated the serious French stage for most of the second half of the nineteenth century. After this, he virtually abandoned the novel (though his semi-autobiographical \"L'Affaire Clemenceau\" (1867) achieved some success).\nIn 1864, Dumas married Nadeja Naryschkine, with whom he had a daughter. After Naryschkine's death, he married Henriette Regnier.\nIn 1874, he was admitted to the Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise and in 1894 he was awarded the \"L\u00E9gion d'Honneur\".\nAlexandre Dumas the son died at Marly-le-Roi, Yvelines, on 27 November 1895 and was interred in the Cimeti\u00E8re de Montmartre in Paris. It was, perhaps coincidentally, only some 100 metres away from Marie Duplessis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":31},{"uri":"Alexandre_Dumas%2C_p%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Alexandre Dumas, p\u00E8re","offset":99},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":130},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":208},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":219},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":266},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":273},{"uri":"Illegitimacy","surface_form":"illegitimate","offset":285},{"uri":"Alexandre_Dumas%2C_p%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Alexandre Dumas","offset":357},{"uri":"1831","surface_form":"1831","offset":377},{"uri":"Institution_Goubaux","surface_form":"Institution Goubaux","offset":505},{"uri":"College_Bourbon","surface_form":"College Bourbon","offset":533},{"uri":"1858","surface_form":"1858","offset":797},{"uri":"Illegitimate","surface_form":"illegitimate","offset":903},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":1076},{"uri":"1844","surface_form":"1844","offset":1251},{"uri":"Saint-Germain-en-Laye","surface_form":"Saint-Germain-en-Laye","offset":1279},{"uri":"Marie_Duplessis","surface_form":"Marie Duplessis","offset":1340},{"uri":"The_Lady_of_the_Camellias","surface_form":"La dame aux cam\u00E9lias","offset":1429},{"uri":"Camellia","surface_form":"Camellia","offset":1469},{"uri":"Giuseppe_Verdi","surface_form":"Verdi's","offset":1596},{"uri":"1853","surface_form":"1853","offset":1604},{"uri":"La_Traviata","surface_form":"La Traviata","offset":1617},{"uri":"1864","surface_form":"1864","offset":2108},{"uri":"Nadeja_Naryschkine","surface_form":"Nadeja Naryschkine","offset":2128},{"uri":"Henriette_Regnier","surface_form":"Henriette Regnier","offset":2215},{"uri":"1874","surface_form":"1874","offset":2237},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise","offset":2266},{"uri":"1894","surface_form":"1894","offset":2292},{"uri":"L%C3%A9gion_d%27Honneur","surface_form":"L\u00E9gion d'Honneur","offset":2317},{"uri":"Marly-le-Roi","surface_form":"Marly-le-Roi","offset":2368},{"uri":"Yvelines","surface_form":"Yvelines","offset":2382},{"uri":"Cimeti%C3%A8re_de_Montmartre","surface_form":"Cimeti\u00E8re de Montmartre","offset":2436},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":2463},{"uri":"Marie_Duplessis","surface_form":"Marie Duplessis","offset":2533}]}
