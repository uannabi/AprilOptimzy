{"id":529137,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Todd_Lee","text":"e=\"preserve\">Derrick Todd Lee (November 5, 1968 \u2013 January 21, 2016) was a convicted American serial killer, nicknamed the Baton Rouge Serial Killer. He was born in St. Francisville, Louisiana.\nHe was linked by DNA to the deaths of seven women in the Baton Rouge and Lafayette areas in Louisiana, and in 2004 was convicted, in separate trials, of the murders of Geralyn DeSoto and Charlotte Murray Pace. The Pace trial resulted in a death sentence. Newspapers have suggested Lee can be linked to other unsolved murders in the area, but the police lacked DNA evidence to prove these connections.\nLee died on January 21, 2016 at the age of 47, of an undisclosed medical condition at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in the West Feliciana Parish, while awaiting execution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":84},{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"serial killer","offset":93},{"uri":"St._Francisville%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"St. Francisville, Louisiana","offset":164},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":210},{"uri":"Baton_Rouge%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"Baton Rouge","offset":250},{"uri":"Lafayette%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"Lafayette","offset":266},{"uri":"Louisiana_State_Penitentiary","surface_form":"Louisiana State Penitentiary","offset":684},{"uri":"West_Feliciana_Parish%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"West Feliciana Parish","offset":720}]}
