{"id":52923,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerulean","text":"Cerulean is a range of colours from teal-blue, sky-blue, bright blue, or azure to deep cyan. The word cerulean comes from the Latin word \"caeruleum\", which means \"sky\" or \"heavens\". This was in turn from Latin \"caeruleus\" deep blue: resembling the blue of the sky.\nIn classical times, this term was used to describe blue pigments, particularly mixtures of copper and cobaltous oxides, called genuine cerulean. These early attempts to create sky blue colours were often less than satisfactory due to greenish hues and lack of permanence. When the artificial pigment cerulean blue was invented people started using this instead.\nThe first recorded use of \"cerulean\" as a color name in English was in 1590.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Teal_(colour)","surface_form":"teal","offset":36},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":41},{"uri":"Azure","surface_form":"azure","offset":73},{"uri":"Cyan","surface_form":"cyan","offset":87},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":126},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":163},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"heaven","offset":172},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":321},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":356},{"uri":"Cobalt","surface_form":"cobaltous","offset":367},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":377},{"uri":"Hue","surface_form":"hue","offset":508},{"uri":"Fugitive_pigments","surface_form":"permanence","offset":525},{"uri":"Cerulean_blue","surface_form":"cerulean blue","offset":565},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":683}]}
