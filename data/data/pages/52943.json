{"id":52943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp","text":"A swamp is part of a wetland ecosystem. Swamps are forested, low, spongy land generally saturated with water and covered with trees and aquatic plants. Big parts of swamps are often flooded with water. Swamps are nesting and breeding grounds for birds and other animals.\nAbout 6 percent of Earth's surface is covered by swamps. Swamps are also filters for groundwater, and protect against flooding. Swamps are one of the key wetland areas which are protected by the international agency Ramsar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":29},{"uri":"Breeding","surface_form":"breeding","offset":225},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":246},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":262},{"uri":"Filter","surface_form":"filter","offset":344},{"uri":"Groundwater","surface_form":"groundwater","offset":356},{"uri":"Flooding","surface_form":"flooding","offset":389},{"uri":"Ramsar","surface_form":"Ramsar","offset":487}]}
