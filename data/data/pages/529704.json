It is on the border with Myanmar, and joins with Myanmar's Tanintharyi Nature Reserve. It is popular with tourists, and is near the beach resort of Hua Hin.\nThe park covers parts of Phetchaburi Province and Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. It contains rainforest on the eastern side of the Tenasserim Mountain Range. The highest elevation is 1,20\u00A0m. Two main rivers begin within the park: the Pranburi River and the Phetchaburi River. The Phetchaburi is blocked by the Kaeng Krachan Dam at the eastern border of the park. The dam creates a lake covering an area of 46.5\u00A0km2. The dam was built in 1966. There are private plantations within the park.\nThe park was created on 12 June 1981. It was the 28th national park of Thailand. It originally covered an area of 2,478\u00A0km2. It was enlarged in December 1984. In 2005 it was shown to UNESCO for consideration as a World Heritage Site.\nThe forests contain a great variety of plants and animals. The killing of wild elephants is a big problem at the park. It is difficult to stop poachers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":32},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":49},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":84},{"uri":"Tanintharyi_Nature_Reserve","surface_form":"Tanintharyi Nature Reserve","offset":118},{"uri":"Hua_Hin","surface_form":"Hua Hin","offset":207},{"uri":"Phetchaburi_Province","surface_form":"Phetchaburi Province","offset":241},{"uri":"Prachuap_Khiri_Khan_Province","surface_form":"Prachuap Khiri Khan Province","offset":266},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":308},{"uri":"Tenasserim_Mountain_Range","surface_form":"Tenasserim Mountain Range","offset":346},{"uri":"Pranburi_River","surface_form":"Pranburi River","offset":449},{"uri":"Phetchaburi_River","surface_form":"Phetchaburi River","offset":472},{"uri":"Kaeng_Krachan_Dam","surface_form":"Kaeng Krachan Dam","offset":525},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"lake","offset":596},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":676},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":888},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":918},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"variety","offset":967},{"uri":"Elephant","surface_form":"elephant","offset":1018},{"uri":"Poaching","surface_form":"poachers","offset":1082}]}
