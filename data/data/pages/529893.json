{"id":529893,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marasmus","text":"Marasmus is a form of malnutrition. It happens in people (especially children) who do not get enough food. A healthy person gets energy from eating food, especially foods with protein and fat in them. Because a person with marasmus is not getting enough food, they do not get the energy they need to survive. This is due to deficiency of both proteins and calories. Generally, this disease when there is an immediate second pregnancy or repeated child births. Lean and weak, swelling limbs, less developed muscles, dry skin, diarrhoea, etc.., are the symptoms of this disease.\nChildren with marasmus look emaciated (very skinny). This is because their bodies have burned up all of their fat and muscles to make energy. The child's body weight will be less than 60% of a normal child his or her age.\nMarasmus can be treated. However, about half of children with bad malnutrition die because they cannot get treatment where they live.\nThe word \u201Cmarasmus\u201D comes from the Greek word \u03BC\u03B1\u03C1\u03B1\u03C3\u03BC\u03CC\u03C2 \"marasmos\" (meaning \"decay \")\nCauses.\nMarasmus is caused by a deficiency (not having enough) of nearly all nutrients, especially protein, carbohydrates, and lipids (fats).\nTreatment.\nMarasmus can be treated by giving emergency nutrients and fluids. However, treating the causes of marasmus is not enough. Often, the disease has complications (it causes other problems), like infections, dehydration, and problems with the circulatory system. These complications are very dangerous and often kill children if they are not treated correctly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Malnutrition","surface_form":"malnutrition","offset":22},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":101},{"uri":"Cellular_respiration","surface_form":"gets energy from eating food","offset":124},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":176},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":188},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":280},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"survive","offset":300},{"uri":"Emaciated","surface_form":"emaciated","offset":605},{"uri":"Muscular_system","surface_form":"muscles","offset":695},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":731},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":736},{"uri":"Therapy","surface_form":"treated","offset":815},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":968},{"uri":"Decay","surface_form":"decay \")","offset":1009},{"uri":"Deficiency","surface_form":"deficiency","offset":1050},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"nutrient","offset":1095},{"uri":"Lipid","surface_form":"lipid","offset":1145},{"uri":"Emergency","surface_form":"emergency","offset":1205},{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":1229},{"uri":"Complication","surface_form":"complication","offset":1316},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":1363},{"uri":"Dehydration","surface_form":"dehydration","offset":1375},{"uri":"Circulatory_system","surface_form":"circulatory system","offset":1410},{"uri":"Danger","surface_form":"danger","offset":1459}]}
