{"id":530213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_representative","text":"=\"preserve\">A union representative, union steward or shop steward is an employee of an organization or company who represents and defends the interests of her/his fellow employees but who also works for a trades union.\nOrdinary members of the union are elected to this position by fellow workers or sometimes by appointment of a higher union body. While working as a representative, they keep their role as an employee of the company.\nAs a result, the union steward becomes an important link and source of information between the union leadership and ordinary workers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":72},{"uri":"Trades_union","surface_form":"trades union","offset":205},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":253}]}
