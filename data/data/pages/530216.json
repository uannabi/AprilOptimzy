The Labour Party in Northern Ireland has, since February 2009, been organised as a single constituency.\nFor much of the Labour Party's history, especially during the 1980s, CLPs were perceived as the more left wing faction in the Labour Party. The unions were said to be a more moderate or pragmatic force.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organisation","surface_form":"organisation","offset":53},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":92},{"uri":"List_of_United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies","surface_form":"UK parliamentary","offset":130},{"uri":"Constituency","surface_form":"constituency","offset":147},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":163},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":172},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":185},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":212},{"uri":"Left_wing","surface_form":"left wing","offset":397},{"uri":"Trades_union","surface_form":"unions","offset":440}]}
