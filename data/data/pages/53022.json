After the death of Mandalore the Ultimate, Revan claimed the title of \"Dark Lord of the Sith\". He then founded a powerful new Sith Empire, and declared war on the Republic and the Jedi themselves. After defeating almost all of the Republic territories, Revan was captured by the Jedi due to the betrayal of his apprentice Darth Malak. He almost died (a small spark of the Force kept him alive) and was brought to the Council to have his mind replaced by a new identity that was loyal to the Republic. Even after discovering his former identity, he rejected the dark side. Revan ended the war he had begun by killing Malak. After the Jedi Civil War, Revan was given back his rank as Jedi Knight at age 26.\nHe was the lover of Bastila Shan. A year later, all his memories returned. He later left to the Unknown Regions to face this new threat known as the \"True Sith\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":40},{"uri":"Star_Wars","surface_form":"Star Wars","offset":60},{"uri":"Fictional_universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":71},{"uri":"Jedi","surface_form":"Jedi Knight","offset":97},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"general","offset":113},{"uri":"Mandalorian_Wars","surface_form":"Mandalorian Wars","offset":156},{"uri":"Mandalore_the_Ultimate","surface_form":"Mandalore the Ultimate","offset":193},{"uri":"Sith","surface_form":"Dark Lord of the Sith","offset":245},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"founded","offset":277},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"Empire","offset":305},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":326},{"uri":"Republic_(Star_Wars)","surface_form":"Republic","offset":337},{"uri":"Betrayal","surface_form":"betrayal","offset":469},{"uri":"Apprentice","surface_form":"apprentice","offset":485},{"uri":"Darth_Malak","surface_form":"Darth Malak","offset":496},{"uri":"Jedi_council","surface_form":"Council","offset":591},{"uri":"Identity","surface_form":"identity","offset":634},{"uri":"Kill","surface_form":"kill","offset":782},{"uri":"Jedi_Civil_War","surface_form":"Jedi Civil War","offset":807},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":890},{"uri":"Bastila_Shan","surface_form":"Bastila Shan","offset":899},{"uri":"Unknown_Regions_(Star_Wars)","surface_form":"Unknown Regions","offset":975},{"uri":"Threat","surface_form":"threat","offset":1008}]}
