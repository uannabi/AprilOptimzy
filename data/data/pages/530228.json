It does not matter whether the nation has a just cause for war.\nThe term can also refer to pacifism, which is the opposition to all use of military force during conflicts. Many activists distinguish between anti-war movements and peace movements. Anti-war activists work through protest and other peaceful means to attempt to pressure a government (or governments) to put an end to a particular war or conflict.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Social_movement","surface_form":"social movement","offset":43},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":122},{"uri":"Casus_belli","surface_form":"just cause","offset":171},{"uri":"Pacifism","surface_form":"pacifism","offset":218},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":266},{"uri":"Conflict","surface_form":"conflict","offset":288},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":304},{"uri":"Peace_movement","surface_form":"peace movement","offset":357}]}
