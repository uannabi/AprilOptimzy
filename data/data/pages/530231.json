It was most commonly used in the twentieth century in the context of \"unilateral nuclear disarmament\", a recurrent mission of peace movements in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom.\nNations do not often choose to dismantle their entire military capability. Unilateral disarmament is usually sought in one technical competency, such as weapons of mass destruction. Non-violent political movements from that of Mahatma Gandhi to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament have recommended unilateral disarmament as a step toward world peace.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policy","offset":28},{"uri":"Unilateral_nuclear_disarmament","surface_form":"unilateral nuclear disarmament","offset":211},{"uri":"Peace_movement","surface_form":"peace movement","offset":267},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":308},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":330},{"uri":"Weapons_of_mass_destruction","surface_form":"weapons of mass destruction","offset":499},{"uri":"Mahatma_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mahatma Gandhi","offset":573},{"uri":"Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament","surface_form":"Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament","offset":595}]}
