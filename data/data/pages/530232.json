{"id":530232,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disarmament","text":"Nuclear disarmament talks about the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-weapon-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.\nNuclear disarmament groups include the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Peace Action, Greenpeace, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, Mayors for Peace, Global Zero, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017), and the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation.\nThere have been many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history.\nIn recent years, some U.S. elder statesmen have also advocated nuclear disarmament. Sam Nunn, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in various op-ed columns have proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Organisations such as Global Zero, an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament, have also been established.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nuclear_weapons","surface_form":"nuclear weapons","offset":67},{"uri":"Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament","surface_form":"Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament","offset":227},{"uri":"Peace_Action","surface_form":"Peace Action","offset":261},{"uri":"Greenpeace","surface_form":"Greenpeace","offset":275},{"uri":"International_Physicians_for_the_Prevention_of_Nuclear_War","surface_form":"International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War","offset":287},{"uri":"Mayors_for_Peace","surface_form":"Mayors for Peace","offset":347},{"uri":"Global_Zero_(campaign)","surface_form":"Global Zero","offset":365},{"uri":"International_Campaign_to_Abolish_Nuclear_Weapons","surface_form":"International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons","offset":382},{"uri":"Nobel_Peace_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":447},{"uri":"Nuclear_Age_Peace_Foundation","surface_form":"Nuclear Age Peace Foundation","offset":483},{"uri":"Demonstration_(people)","surface_form":"demonstrations","offset":553},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":572},{"uri":"Central_Park","surface_form":"Central Park","offset":651},{"uri":"Nuclear_weapons","surface_form":"nuclear weapons","offset":672},{"uri":"Cold_war","surface_form":"cold war","offset":710},{"uri":"Arms_race","surface_form":"arms race","offset":719},{"uri":"Demonstration_(people)","surface_form":"protest","offset":762},{"uri":"Sam_Nunn","surface_form":"Sam Nunn","offset":915},{"uri":"William_Perry","surface_form":"William Perry","offset":925},{"uri":"Henry_Kissinger","surface_form":"Henry Kissinger","offset":940},{"uri":"George_Shultz","surface_form":"George Shultz","offset":961},{"uri":"Global_Zero_(campaign)","surface_form":"Global Zero","offset":1252}]}
