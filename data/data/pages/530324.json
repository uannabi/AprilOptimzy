Harriet Harman, the Deputy Leader, became Acting Leader but announced that she would resign after the leadership election.\nCandidates.\nFour candidates were successfully nominated to stand in the election: Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall. The voting process began on Friday 14 August 2015 and closed on Thursday 10 September 2015. The results were announced on Saturday 12 September 2015. Voting was by Labour Party members and registered supporters. They voted using the alternative vote system.\nResults.\nWhen Corbyn entered the election, he was considered unlikely to win. However, support for him increased quickly. Opinion polls showed him leading against the other candidates. This led to warnings from people such as Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, Jack Straw, David Miliband, and Alastair Campbell. Many of them claimed that Corbyn's election as leader would leave the party unable to win elections. Corbyn won the election in the first round, with 59.5% of the votes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":46},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"leader of the Labour Party","offset":69},{"uri":"Jeremy_Corbyn","surface_form":"Jeremy Corbyn","offset":129},{"uri":"Ed_Miliband","surface_form":"Ed Miliband","offset":174},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2015","surface_form":"2015 general election","offset":242},{"uri":"Harriet_Harman","surface_form":"Harriet Harman","offset":265},{"uri":"Deputy_Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Deputy Leader","offset":285},{"uri":"Andy_Burnham","surface_form":"Andy Burnham","offset":470},{"uri":"Yvette_Cooper","surface_form":"Yvette Cooper","offset":484},{"uri":"Jeremy_Corbyn","surface_form":"Jeremy Corbyn","offset":499},{"uri":"Liz_Kendall","surface_form":"Liz Kendall","offset":517},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":694},{"uri":"Instant-runoff_voting","surface_form":"alternative vote","offset":763},{"uri":"Gordon_Brown","surface_form":"Gordon Brown","offset":1014},{"uri":"Tony_Blair","surface_form":"Tony Blair","offset":1028},{"uri":"Jack_Straw","surface_form":"Jack Straw","offset":1040},{"uri":"David_Miliband","surface_form":"David Miliband","offset":1052},{"uri":"Alastair_Campbell","surface_form":"Alastair Campbell","offset":1072}]}
