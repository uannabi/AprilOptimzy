{"id":530340,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests","text":"e=\"preserve\">On February 15, 2003, there was a day of protests across the world. The protests were to express people's opposition to the imminent invasion of Iraq. They were held in more than 600 cities. It was part of a series of protests and political events that had begun in 2002 and continued as the war took place. Social movement researchers have described the 15\u00A0February protest as \"the largest protest event in human history.\"\nSources vary in their estimations of the number of participants involved. According to BBC News, between six and eleven million people took part in protests in up to sixty countries over the weekend of the 15th and 16th. Other estimates range from eight million to thirty million.\nSome of the largest protests took place in Europe. The protest in Rome involved around three million people, and is listed in the 2004 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the largest anti-war rally in history. Madrid hosted the second largest rally with more than 1.5 million people protesting the invasion of Iraq; Mainland China was the only major region not to see any protests on that day, but small demonstrations, attended mainly by foreign students, were seen later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":54},{"uri":"2003_invasion_of_Iraq","surface_form":"invasion of Iraq","offset":146},{"uri":"Protests_against_the_Iraq_War","surface_form":"series of protests and political events","offset":221},{"uri":"Social_movement","surface_form":"Social movement","offset":321},{"uri":"BBC_News","surface_form":"BBC News","offset":524},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":761},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":784},{"uri":"Guinness_Book_of_Records","surface_form":"Guinness Book of World Records","offset":854},{"uri":"Anti-war_movement","surface_form":"anti-war","offset":901},{"uri":"Demonstration_(people)","surface_form":"rally","offset":910},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":928},{"uri":"Mainland_China","surface_form":"Mainland China","offset":1034}]}
