{"id":530344,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-party_parliamentary_group","text":"=\"preserve\">An all-party parliamentary group (APPG) is a grouping in the British Parliament that is made up of politicians from all political parties.\nIf a parliament consists of both a lower house and an upper house, all-party parliamentary groups can usually include members of both houses. In the British Parliament, for example, APPGs include members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\nIn the British Parliament, an associate parliamentary group is similar to an all-party parliamentary group except that it is made up of not only members of the House of Commons or Lords but can also include members from outside Parliament.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British Parliament","offset":73},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political parties","offset":132},{"uri":"Lower_house","surface_form":"lower house","offset":186},{"uri":"Upper_house","surface_form":"upper house","offset":205},{"uri":"British_House_of_Commons","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":362},{"uri":"House_of_Lords","surface_form":"House of Lords","offset":387}]}
