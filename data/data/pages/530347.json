{"id":530347,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagos_Archipelago","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Chagos Archipelago (or) or Chagos Islands (formerly the Bassas de Chagas, and later the Oil Islands) is a group of seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. The atolls are made up of more than 60 individual islands. The islands are located about south of Maldives.\nAs of 2018, Mauritius has taken the matter to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion, against British objections.\nThe islands make up the British Indian Ocean Territory.\nOn 25 February 2019, in an advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice found that the United Kingdom \"illegally\" separated the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius after its independence in 1968.\nThe UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on May 22, 2019, commanding Great Britain to return the Chagos Archipelago to the Republic of Mauritius within six months, which would allow Chagossians to recover their land.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atoll","surface_form":"atoll","offset":138},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":152},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":216},{"uri":"Maldives","surface_form":"Maldives","offset":264},{"uri":"British_Indian_Ocean_Territory","surface_form":"British Indian Ocean Territory","offset":432}]}
