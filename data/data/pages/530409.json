{"id":530409,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewlap","text":"A dewlap is a flap of skin that hangs beneath the neck of many animals.\nIt can also be used to mean other things such as a double chin on a person or the vocal sac of a frog. The term dewlap can also be used to mean a \"caruncle\", defined as \"a small, fleshy excrescence that is a normal part of an animal's anatomy\". At times the appearance of a dewlap indicates a stage in an animal's development. For example, the appearance of a dewlap on a female rabbit indicates she is of breeding age.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":22},{"uri":"Neck_(body_part)","surface_form":"neck","offset":50},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animals","offset":63},{"uri":"Double_chin","surface_form":"double chin","offset":123},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"person","offset":140},{"uri":"Vocal_sac","surface_form":"vocal sac","offset":154},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":169},{"uri":"Caruncle_(bird_anatomy)","surface_form":"\"caruncle\"","offset":218},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":403},{"uri":"Rabbit","surface_form":"rabbit","offset":451},{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"breeding","offset":478}]}
