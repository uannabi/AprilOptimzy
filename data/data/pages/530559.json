{"id":530559,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_consonant","text":"=\"preserve\">Stops or plosives are consonant sounds that are formed by completely stopping airflow.\nStop sounds can be voiceless, like the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/, or voiced, like /b/, /d/, and /g/. In phonetics, a plosive consonant is made by blocking a part of the mouth so that no air can pass through. Pressure builds up behind the block, and when the air is allowed to pass through again, a sound is created. This sound is the plosive consonant. The blocking is usually done using the tongue, the lips or the throat. Plosives can be voiced or voiceless.\nIPA.\nis a glottal stop which is made in the throat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":34},{"uri":"Phonetics","surface_form":"phonetics","offset":202},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"Pressure","offset":306},{"uri":"Tongue","surface_form":"tongue","offset":490},{"uri":"Lips","surface_form":"lips","offset":502},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":514},{"uri":"Voiced","surface_form":"voiced","offset":538},{"uri":"Voiceless","surface_form":"voiceless","offset":548},{"uri":"Glottal_stop","surface_form":"glottal stop","offset":569}]}
