{"id":530599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duggan","text":"Michael Edward \"Mike\" Duggan (born July 15, 1958) is an American lawyer, prosecutor and businessman. He is serving as mayor of Detroit, Michigan. He was elected mayor in 2013.\nHe received attention from across the country in part because he is the first white mayor of the city since Roman Gribbs in the early 1970s. Currently, most of the people living in Detroit are African American. This was not the case at the time when Gribbs was mayor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":56},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":65},{"uri":"Prosecutor","surface_form":"prosecutor","offset":73},{"uri":"List_of_mayors_of_Detroit%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"mayor","offset":118},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":127},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":136},{"uri":"Detroit_mayoral_election%2C_2013","surface_form":"elected mayor","offset":153},{"uri":"White_American","surface_form":"white","offset":254},{"uri":"Roman_Gribbs","surface_form":"Roman Gribbs","offset":284},{"uri":"African_American","surface_form":"African American","offset":369}]}
