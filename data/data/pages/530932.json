{"id":530932,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_property","text":"A property, commonly shortened to prop (plural: props), is any object used in performing arts during a performance. They are used on the stage in theatre, and on the screen by actors in movies and television. A prop is anything on a stage or a set that is able to be moved. It is different from the scenery, costumes and production equipment.\nAnything that is used but is not part of the scenery (the set) is a prop, e.g., furniture, a book that an actor pretends to read, a pipe that they smoke. Food appearing in the production is also a prop.\nProps are looked after by a properties master. Sometimes, for small things like books or fans, it is the actor who is responsible for making sure he has the prop. This is called a \"personal prop\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Performing_arts","surface_form":"performing arts","offset":78},{"uri":"Performance","surface_form":"performance","offset":103},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":146},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":176},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":186},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":197},{"uri":"Theatrical_scenery","surface_form":"scenery","offset":299},{"uri":"Costume","surface_form":"costume","offset":308},{"uri":"Equipment","surface_form":"equipment","offset":332},{"uri":"Furniture","surface_form":"furniture","offset":423},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":436},{"uri":"Pipe_(smoke)","surface_form":"pipe","offset":475},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fans","offset":635}]}
