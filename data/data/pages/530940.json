{"id":530940,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_property","text":"e=\"preserve\">In science, a property is anything that describes a material or substance. It is a characteristic of that material. For example, how hard the material is, its colour, or its shape. Elasticity is a property of rubber; in other words: rubber is elastic. A property may be a constant (always the same) or it may only appear when something changes, such as temperature.\nChemical properties include things like surface tension, pH, reactivity, allotropy. Conductivity is how able a material is to transport electric charge or heat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":16},{"uri":"Describe","surface_form":"describes","offset":53},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":65},{"uri":"Chemical_substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":77},{"uri":"Characteristic","surface_form":"characteristic","offset":96},{"uri":"Hardness","surface_form":"hard","offset":146},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":172},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":187},{"uri":"Elasticity_(physics)","surface_form":"Elasticity","offset":194},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":222},{"uri":"Physical_constant","surface_form":"constant","offset":285},{"uri":"Independent_variables","surface_form":"something changes","offset":339},{"uri":"Chemical_property","surface_form":"Chemical properties","offset":379},{"uri":"Surface_tension","surface_form":"surface tension","offset":419},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH","offset":436},{"uri":"Reactivity_(chemistry)","surface_form":"reactivity","offset":440},{"uri":"Allotropy","surface_form":"allotropy","offset":452},{"uri":"Electrical_conductivity","surface_form":"electric charge","offset":515},{"uri":"Thermal_conductivity","surface_form":"heat","offset":534}]}
