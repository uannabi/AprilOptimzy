{"id":530946,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_theory","text":"=\"preserve\">Approximation theory is a field of mathematics which is concerned with approximating the values of a function. Usually, the approximation is only needed for a range of values or domain. A good approximation will only have a small error in the domain of interest.\nThere are different ways in which this approximation is done: common ones are using a combination of simpler functions or using polynomials.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":47},{"uri":"Approximation","surface_form":"approximating","offset":83},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":113},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":403}]}
