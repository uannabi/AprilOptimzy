{"id":531083,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_spider","text":"A social spider is a species of spider which lives in a group. Most spiders are solitary, but a few species in tropical habitats live in large groups.\nThis social organisation has evolved independently a number of times. At least 23 species in eight families are known.\nThese spiders have not developed a caste system, and so they are not classed as eusocial. The first one was discovered over a century ago by Eug\u00E8ne Simon (30 April 1848 \u2013 17 November 1924). This French naturalist described over 4,000 species of spider.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":21},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":32},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":111},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":120},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":250},{"uri":"Caste_(biology)","surface_form":"caste","offset":305},{"uri":"Eusociality","surface_form":"eusocial","offset":350},{"uri":"Eug%C3%A8ne_Simon","surface_form":"Eug\u00E8ne Simon","offset":411},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":472}]}
