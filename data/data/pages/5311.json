{"id":5311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur","text":"Sulfur (or sulphur) is a chemical element. The symbol for sulfur is S, and its atomic number is 16.\nProperties.\nSulfur is a yellow solid that is a nonmetal. It is fragile (easily broken) and crystalline. It burns easily, releasing toxic fumes of sulfur dioxide. It has a very faint odor. If it is melted and cooled very quickly, it makes a rubbery form of sulfur that is called \"plastic sulfur\". It gradually turns back into the yellow brittle form. It does not dissolve in water. The smell normally known as \"sulfur\" comes from hydrogen sulfide and similar chemicals. These sulfides are produced when things decay without air.\nChemical compounds.\nSulfur compounds are chemical compounds containing sulfur ions. Sulfur comes in several forms: oxidation states of -2 (hydrogen sulfide), +4 (sulfur dioxide, sulfites) and +6 (sulfuric acid, sulfates) are most common, although there are other oxidation states.\nSulfur acids.\nMixture of sulfur oxides and water\nOccurrence and preparation.\nSulfur can be found in the earth near volcanoes. Many minerals contain sulfur ions. Coal contains sulfur ions which are released when it burns. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide are some sulfur compounds that are released when coal burns. They are reacted to make sulfur. Sulfur in the ground in melted, then forced up through pipes by compressed (squeezed) air.\nUses.\nSulfur is commonly used in gunpowder, medicine, and matches. Matches release sulfur dioxide when they burn, giving them their smell. Sulfur is an essential component to living cells. Many proteins contain sulfur. It is also used as a pesticide on organic farms.\nEtymology.\nPowder sulfur is said to be left after an occurrence of a supernatural being.\nToxicity and safety.\nSulfur is not toxic, but the chemical compounds formed when sulfur burns can be very toxic. Sulfuric acid, for example, can make paper turn black!\nHistory.\nThe ancient name for sulfur is \"brimstone\". Sulfur was used in fumigation (making fumes) and medicine in ancient Greece. In 1777, Antoine Lavosier convinced the scientific community that sulfur was an element.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":25},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":79},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":124},{"uri":"Nonmetal","surface_form":"nonmetal","offset":147},{"uri":"Crystalline","surface_form":"crystalline","offset":191},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":231},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":246},{"uri":"Solvation","surface_form":"dissolve","offset":462},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":529},{"uri":"Sulfide","surface_form":"sulfide","offset":575},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":669},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":706},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":743},{"uri":"Hydrogen_sulfide","surface_form":"hydrogen sulfide","offset":767},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":790},{"uri":"Sulfite","surface_form":"sulfite","offset":806},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"sulfuric acid","offset":824},{"uri":"Sulfate","surface_form":"sulfate","offset":839},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":1024},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":1064},{"uri":"Sulfur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulfur dioxide","offset":1151},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":1545},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticide","offset":1591},{"uri":"Organic_farming","surface_form":"organic","offset":1604},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":1758},{"uri":"Burn","surface_form":"burn","offset":1796},{"uri":"Sulfuric_acid","surface_form":"Sulfuric acid","offset":1821},{"uri":"Fumigation","surface_form":"fumigation","offset":1948}]}
