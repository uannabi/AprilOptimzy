This was the large novel \"Sinuhe Egyptilainen\" (UK title: Sinuhe the Egyptian; US title: The Egyptian). The story is placed in ancient Egypt. Waltari knew a lot about life there. Between the lines one can read a story about Christianity and history. The book contains comparison of idealism and realism but it does not tell which of them wins. It became popular also as a Hollywood movie. In later life he worked as a member of the Academy of Finland. He never finished his last novel on the Knights of Malta due to illness. First awarded in 1979, the Mika Waltari Award is named in his honor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Finns","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":65},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":119},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":148},{"uri":"Novella","surface_form":"novella","offset":209},{"uri":"Fairy_tale","surface_form":"fairy tale","offset":247},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":277},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":291},{"uri":"Screenplay","surface_form":"screenplay","offset":312},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio plays","offset":325},{"uri":"Non-fiction","surface_form":"non-fiction","offset":338},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translation","offset":351},{"uri":"Review","surface_form":"review","offset":381},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"articles","offset":393},{"uri":"International","surface_form":"international","offset":414},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":453},{"uri":"University_of_Helsinki","surface_form":"University of Helsinki","offset":556},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":597},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":612},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":624},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short stories","offset":696},{"uri":"Success","surface_form":"success","offset":797},{"uri":"Ernest_Hemingway","surface_form":"Ernest Hemingway","offset":863},{"uri":"F._Scott_Fitzgerald","surface_form":"F.
