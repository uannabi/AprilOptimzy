{"id":531259,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_ship","text":"Coffin ships transported Irish immigrants to America and other colonies during the Great Irish Famine (1845-1852). They were the cheapest way to cross the Atlantic but it was a miserable and dangerous journey. The conditions on board were horrible because the ships were so crowded. Also, there was\u00A0little food and water. There were often diseases on board.\nOne third (30%) of the passengers died before the arrival in Canada or the USA. Legend says sharks liked to follow\u00A0coffin ships because the crew threw\u00A0the dead\u00A0bodies\u00A0overboard.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Transport","surface_form":"transport","offset":13},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":25},{"uri":"Immigrant","surface_form":"immigrant","offset":31},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":45},{"uri":"Colonies","surface_form":"colonies","offset":63},{"uri":"Irish_Potato_Famine","surface_form":"Great Irish Famine","offset":83},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":155},{"uri":"Miserable","surface_form":"miserable","offset":177},{"uri":"Danger","surface_form":"danger","offset":191},{"uri":"On_board","surface_form":"on board","offset":225},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":260},{"uri":"Crowd","surface_form":"crowd","offset":274},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":339},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":381}]}
