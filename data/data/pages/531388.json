The book was followed by \"How Children Learn\", which explained his positive ideas (1967, 2nd ed 1983.\nHolt's sole book on homeschooling, \"Teach Your Own\", was published in 1981. It was revised by his colleague Patrick Farenga and republished in 2003.\nIn his 1974 book, \"Escape from Childhood: the needs and rights of children\", Holt said that children should have the same independence as adults.
