{"id":531771,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_view_doctrine","text":"e=\"preserve\">The plain view doctrine allows law enforcement officers to collect evidence or contraband found in plain view while they are lawfully present. It is an exception to items spelled out in a search warrant and to the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The doctrine is based on the United States Supreme Court decision \"Horton v. California\". The court held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit warrantless seizures of any evidence which is in plain view.\nConditions.\nIn order for an officer to seize an item, the officer must have probable cause to believe the item is evidence of a crime or is contraband. The police may not move objects to get a better view. In \"Arizona v. Hicks\" (1987), the officer was found to have acted unlawfully. While investigating a shooting, the officer moved\u2014without probable cause\u2014stereo equipment to record the serial numbers. They also seized three weapons and a stocking-cap mask. The court granted the defendants motion to suppress all the evidence that had been seized because his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. The plain view doctrine has also been expanded to include the sub doctrines of plain feel, plain smell, and plain hearing.\nDigital searches.\nIn committing crimes, criminals routinely use computers and mobile devices. The courts have so far allowed law enforcement a broad authority to examine all files on computers in search of illegal materials.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Police_officer","surface_form":"law enforcement officers","offset":44},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":80},{"uri":"Contraband","surface_form":"contraband","offset":92},{"uri":"Lawful","surface_form":"lawful","offset":138},{"uri":"Warrant_(law)","surface_form":"search warrant","offset":201},{"uri":"Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Fourth Amendment","offset":227},{"uri":"Reasonable","surface_form":"reasonable","offset":265},{"uri":"Search_and_seizure","surface_form":"searches and seizures","offset":276},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States Supreme Court","offset":328},{"uri":"Horton_v._California","surface_form":"Horton v.
