{"id":531944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_primary","text":"=\"preserve\">In the United States, a presidential primary is a series of elections and caucuses within a political party. They are held to choose the party's candidate for the presidential election. This process was never included in the United States Constitution; it was created over time by the political parties. Some states hold only primary elections, some hold only caucuses, and others use a combination of both.\nThese primaries and caucuses are staggered generally between either late-January or early-February, and mid-June before the presidential election in November. The primary elections are run by state and local governments.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":19},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":72},{"uri":"Caucus","surface_form":"caucus","offset":86},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":104},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"presidential election","offset":175},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":237},{"uri":"Primary_election","surface_form":"primary election","offset":338},{"uri":"Caucuses","surface_form":"caucuses","offset":372}]}
