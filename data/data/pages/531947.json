{"id":531947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viggo_Rivad","text":"Viggo Reinholdt Rivad (3 July 1922 \u2013 8 February 2016) was a Danish photographer. His career began in 1946, and he went on to win many competitions in the 1950s and 1960s. He was born in N\u00F8rrebro, Denmark.\nAround 1960, he adopted his so-called \"essay approach\". This resulted in a series of related photographs such as \"Et farvel\" (1962) and \"Laurits\" (1971). Rivad also earned a living as a taxi driver. He was a quiet, dedicated photographer, concentrating on disadvantaged areas and people on the edges of society. His humanitarian messages were a result of his anger and concern for society's outcasts.\nRivad died in Copenhagen, Denmark of complications from a stroke on 8 February 2016. He was 93 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Danish_people","surface_form":"Danish","offset":60},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":67},{"uri":"Taxi","surface_form":"taxi","offset":391},{"uri":"Humanitarian","surface_form":"humanitarian","offset":521},{"uri":"Outcast","surface_form":"outcasts","offset":596},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":620},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":664}]}
