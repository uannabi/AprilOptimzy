{"id":531996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea","text":"In Greek mythology, Medea (;, \"M\u0113deia\", \"Medea\") is a sorceress of Greek mythology. She was the daughter of King Ae\u00EBtes of Colchis, niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios. She married the hero Jason, and had two children with him, Mermeros and Pheres. In Euripides's play \"Medea\", Jason leaves Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers him his daughter, Glauce. The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children.\nThe myths involving Jason have been interpreted as part of a class of myths that tell how the Hellenes of the distant heroic age, before the Trojan War, faced the challenges of the pre-Greek \"Pelasgian\" cultures of mainland Greece, the Aegean and Anatolia. Jason, Perseus, Theseus, and above all Heracles, are all figures on the threshold between the old world of shamans, earth deities, and the new Bronze Age Greek ways.\nMedea figures in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, a myth known best from a late literary version worked up by Apollonius of Rhodes in the 3rd century BC and called the \"Argonautica.\" However, for all its self-consciousness and researched archaic vocabulary, the late epic was based on very old, scattered materials. Medea is known in most stories as an enchantress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess Hecate or a witch. The myth of Jason and Medea is very old, originally written around the time Hesiod wrote the \"Theogony\". It was known to the composer of the \"Little Iliad\", part of the Epic Cycle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":3},{"uri":"Aeetes","surface_form":"King Ae\u00EBtes","offset":108},{"uri":"Colchis","surface_form":"Colchis","offset":123},{"uri":"Circe","surface_form":"Circe","offset":141},{"uri":"Helios","surface_form":"Helios","offset":177},{"uri":"Jason","surface_form":"Jason","offset":206},{"uri":"Mermeros_and_Pheres","surface_form":"Mermeros and Pheres","offset":244},{"uri":"Euripides","surface_form":"Euripides","offset":268},{"uri":"Medea_(play)","surface_form":"Medea","offset":286},{"uri":"Creon_(king_of_Corinth)","surface_form":"Creon","offset":318},{"uri":"Ancient_Corinth","surface_form":"Corinth","offset":333},{"uri":"Glauce","surface_form":"Glauce","offset":367},{"uri":"Trojan_War","surface_form":"Trojan War","offset":599},{"uri":"Pelasgian","surface_form":"Pelasgian","offset":650},{"uri":"Jason","surface_form":"Jason","offset":715},{"uri":"Perseus","surface_form":"Perseus","offset":722},{"uri":"Theseus","surface_form":"Theseus","offset":731},{"uri":"Heracles","surface_form":"Heracles","offset":754},{"uri":"Shaman","surface_form":"shaman","offset":822},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":858},{"uri":"Argonauts","surface_form":"Argonauts","offset":924},{"uri":"Apollonius_of_Rhodes","surface_form":"Apollonius of Rhodes","offset":995},{"uri":"Argonautica","surface_form":"Argonautica","offset":1054},{"uri":"Hecate","surface_form":"Hecate","offset":1302},{"uri":"Witch","surface_form":"witch","offset":1314},{"uri":"Hesiod","surface_form":"Hesiod","offset":1397},{"uri":"Theogony","surface_form":"Theogony","offset":1415},{"uri":"Little_Iliad","surface_form":"Little Iliad","offset":1463},{"uri":"Epic_Cycle","surface_form":"Epic Cycle","offset":1490}]}
