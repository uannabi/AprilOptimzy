{"id":531998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak","text":"A cloak is a type of loose garment. It is worn over indoor clothing. It protects a person, for example from cold or rain. It may be part of an outfit or uniform. Cloaks have been used by many historical societies. Their designs, over time, have been changed to match fashion and available textiles.\nCloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder. They can be different lengths, from hip all the way down the ankle. They may have an attached hood. They may fasten down the front. Cloaks are almost always sleeveless.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Garment","surface_form":"garment","offset":27},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":59},{"uri":"Uniform","surface_form":"uniform","offset":153},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":289},{"uri":"Neck","surface_form":"neck","offset":330},{"uri":"Shoulder","surface_form":"shoulder","offset":347},{"uri":"Ankle","surface_form":"ankle","offset":418},{"uri":"Hood","surface_form":"hood","offset":451}]}
