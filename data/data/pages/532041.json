{"id":532041,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tories","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Tories were one of the two political parties which existed in Britain from the 17th to the early 19th centuries. They were the opponents of the Whigs, which were for a long time the ruling party.\nDuring that period the country was called (in sequence) the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Great Britain and later the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe Tories were originally (1678 to about 1770) the supporters of the Catholic kings (Charles I and II, James I and II), limiting the power of UK Parliament and supporting freedoms for Catholics. Later, (1780 to 1830) they became the New Tory Party, and were again a successful party able to hold government.\nThe most famous leaders of the New Tory Party were William Pitt the Younger, and Robert Peel the industrialist. Benjamin Disraeli built the modern Conservative Party out of the remains of the New Tory Party.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Whigs","surface_form":"Whigs","offset":161},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"Kingdom of England","offset":273},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Kingdom of Great Britain","offset":297},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","surface_form":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland","offset":336},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":451},{"uri":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK Parliament","offset":524},{"uri":"William_Pitt_the_Younger","surface_form":"William Pitt the Younger","offset":741},{"uri":"Robert_Peel","surface_form":"Robert Peel","offset":771},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industrialist","offset":787},{"uri":"Benjamin_Disraeli","surface_form":"Benjamin Disraeli","offset":802},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative Party","offset":837}]}
