He served as Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856.\nHe created the doctrine of lapse; by this some Indian customs of inheritance were forbidden. He passed The Hindu Remarriage Act in 1856. He built the first railway line which was between Bombay and Thane. Under his rule several independent Indian states were annexed by applying the doctrine of lapse, e.g. the state of Jhansi. The Kingdom of Oudh was also annexed because the governor general thought its government was corrupt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_Thistle","surface_form":"KT","offset":66},{"uri":"Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council","surface_form":"PC","offset":70},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":220},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_India","surface_form":"Governor-General of India","offset":248},{"uri":"Doctrine_of_lapse","surface_form":"doctrine of lapse","offset":308},{"uri":"Bombay","surface_form":"Bombay","offset":480}]}
