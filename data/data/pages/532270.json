{"id":532270,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene","text":"\"The Selfish Gene\" is a book on evolution by Richard Dawkins, published in 1976. It builds upon the work of George C. Williams's book: \"Adaptation and Natural Selection\", and helped popularize W.D. Hamilton's work.\nDawkins used the term \"selfish gene\" as a way of expressing the \"gene-centred view of evolution\". From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other.\nAn organism evolves to maximise its inclusive fitness\u2014the number of copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular individual).\nThe book also coins the term \"meme\" for a unit of human cultural evolution analogous to the gene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":32},{"uri":"Richard_Dawkins","surface_form":"Richard Dawkins","offset":45},{"uri":"George_C._Williams","surface_form":"George C.
