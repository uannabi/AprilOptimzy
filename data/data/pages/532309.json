{"id":532309,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Central Politburo of the Communist Party of China is a group of 25 people who oversee the Communist Party of China. It is formally called the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. It was previously called the Central Bureau () before 1927. Unlike politburos (political bureaus) of other Communist parties, power within the politburo is centralized in the Politburo Standing Committee. The members of the Politburo are nominally elected by the Central Committee.\nThe power of the Politburo is mostly due to the fact that its members generally also hold positions within the government of the People's Republic of China. It also appoints people to high-ranking jobs. The topics for discussion at the meetings appears to be controlled by the General Secretary. Decisions are made by consensus rather than by majority vote.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party of China","offset":107},{"uri":"Politburo","surface_form":"politburo","offset":273},{"uri":"Communist_party","surface_form":"Communist parties","offset":313},{"uri":"Politburo_Standing_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Politburo Standing Committee","offset":381},{"uri":"Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Central Committee","offset":469},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":617},{"uri":"General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"General Secretary","offset":765},{"uri":"Consensus","surface_form":"consensus","offset":806}]}
