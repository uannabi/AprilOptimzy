{"id":532310,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_of_China","text":"e=\"preserve\">The State Council is the cabinet of the People's Republic of China. Currently, the council has 35 members: the premier, four vice premiers, five state councilors (of whom two are also ministers), and 25 additional ministers and chairs of major agencies. Constitutionally, the State Council is the same as the Central People's Government since 1954 (particularly in relation to local governments).\nIn the politics of China, the Central People's Government forms one of three interlocking branches of power, the others being the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army. The State Council directly oversees the various subordinate People's Governments in the provinces, and in practice maintains membership with the top levels of the Communist Party of China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cabinet_(government)","surface_form":"cabinet","offset":38},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":53},{"uri":"Premier_of_China","surface_form":"premier","offset":124},{"uri":"Constitution_of_China","surface_form":"Constitutionally","offset":267},{"uri":"Politics_of_China","surface_form":"politics of China","offset":417},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party of China","offset":540},{"uri":"People%27s_Liberation_Army","surface_form":"People's Liberation Army","offset":573},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party of China","offset":762}]}
