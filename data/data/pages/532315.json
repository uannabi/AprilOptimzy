However, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, changed the traditional power transfer rule. While Hu was not as unfortunate as Sun who was charged and sentenced (in 2018) due to corruption, he failed to enter the leadership core of CPC - the Politburo Standing Committee.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":36},{"uri":"Hubei","surface_form":"Hubei","offset":63},{"uri":"Peking_University","surface_form":"Beijing University","offset":107},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":217},{"uri":"Hu_Jintao","surface_form":"Hu Jingtao","offset":281},{"uri":"Communist_Youth_League_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Youth League of China","offset":376},{"uri":"Communist_Youth_League_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Youth League of China","offset":604},{"uri":"Hebei","surface_form":"Hebei","offset":712},{"uri":"Inner_Mongolia","surface_form":"Inner Mongolia","offset":941},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party","offset":1025},{"uri":"Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Politburo","offset":1043},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party","offset":1074},{"uri":"Guangdong","surface_form":"Guangdong","offset":1103},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party","offset":1175},{"uri":"Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Politburo","offset":1193},{"uri":"Sun_Zhengcai","surface_form":"Sun Zhengcai","offset":1210},{"uri":"Generations_of_Chinese_leadership","surface_form":"'sixth generation' of Chinese leadership","offset":1267},{"uri":"Xi_Jinping","surface_form":"Xi Jinping","offset":1318},{"uri":"General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"General Secretary of the Communist Party of China","offset":1334},{"uri":"CPC_Politburo_Standing_Committee","surface_form":"Politburo Standing Committee","offset":1580}]}
