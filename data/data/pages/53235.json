{"id":53235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(region)","text":"The West Midlands is an official Region of England, covering the western half of the Midlands.\nGeography.\nThe official region contains the large conurbation that includes Birmingham and Wolverhampton and includes also the mainly rural shire counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire.\nThere is some confusion in the use of the term \"West Midlands\", as the name is also used for the much smaller West Midlands county, and is still used by various organisations within that area such as West Midlands Police and West Midlands Fire Service.\nThe highest point in the region is Black Mountain, at 703 metres.\nRegional Assembly.\nThe official representative body of the region is the West Midlands Regional Assembly which has limited administrative functions such as regional planning and economic development. The assembly is not an elected body, but is made up of members appointed from local councils across the region, and members from regional interest groups such as business and environmental groups and trade unions.\nLocal government.\nKey: shire county = \u2020 | metropolitan county = *\nEconomy.\nCoal mining used to be the main industry of the Black Country. Nationally famous companies in the West Midlands are Cadbury's in Bournville, Birmingham; the brewing companies such as Coors Brewers in Burton on Trent, as well as Marmite; JCB is based in Staffordshire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Regions_of_England","surface_form":"Region of England","offset":33},{"uri":"Midlands","surface_form":"Midlands","offset":85},{"uri":"Conurbation","surface_form":"conurbation","offset":145},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":171},{"uri":"Wolverhampton","surface_form":"Wolverhampton","offset":186},{"uri":"Shire","surface_form":"shire","offset":235},{"uri":"Herefordshire","surface_form":"Herefordshire","offset":253},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":268},{"uri":"Staffordshire","surface_form":"Staffordshire","offset":280},{"uri":"Warwickshire","surface_form":"Warwickshire","offset":295},{"uri":"Worcestershire","surface_form":"Worcestershire","offset":312},{"uri":"West_Midlands_(county)","surface_form":"West Midlands county","offset":438},{"uri":"West_Midlands_Police","surface_form":"West Midlands Police","offset":528},{"uri":"West_Midlands_Fire_Service","surface_form":"West Midlands Fire Service","offset":553},{"uri":"Black_Mountain_(hill)","surface_form":"Black Mountain","offset":616},{"uri":"West_Midlands_Regional_Assembly","surface_form":"West Midlands Regional Assembly","offset":720},{"uri":"Shire_county","surface_form":"shire county","offset":1084},{"uri":"Metropolitan_county","surface_form":"metropolitan county","offset":1103},{"uri":"Bournville","surface_form":"Bournville","offset":1265},{"uri":"Molson_Coors_Brewing_Company","surface_form":"Coors Brewers","offset":1319},{"uri":"Marmite","surface_form":"Marmite","offset":1364},{"uri":"J._C._Bamford","surface_form":"JCB","offset":1373}]}
