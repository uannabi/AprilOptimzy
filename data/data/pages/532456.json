{"id":532456,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Za%C3%AF","text":"Za\u00EF is a technique used in agriculture. Holes are dug in the soil to catch water. They have been used in the western Sahel area to make soil healthier and grow more plants.\nYacouba Sawadogo, a farmer from Burkina Faso, is bringing back za\u00EF holes. He came up with the idea of filling them with manure and compost as food for plants. The manure attracts termites, whose tunnels help further break up the soil. He also made the holes slightly bigger than the traditional ones. Za\u00EF holes help trees, sorghum, and millet make up to 500% more food or wood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":27},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":75},{"uri":"Sahel","surface_form":"Sahel","offset":117},{"uri":"Yacouba_Sawadogo","surface_form":"Yacouba Sawadogo","offset":173},{"uri":"Manure","surface_form":"manure","offset":293},{"uri":"Compost","surface_form":"compost","offset":304},{"uri":"Sorghum","surface_form":"sorghum","offset":496},{"uri":"Millet","surface_form":"millet","offset":509}]}
