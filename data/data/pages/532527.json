It is sometimes called the circumflex nerve.\nFunction.\nThe axillary nerve sends and receives signals from three muscles in the arm: deltoid (a muscle of the shoulder), teres minor (one of the rotator cuff muscles) and the long head of the triceps brachii.\nThe axillary nerve sends signals to two muscles in the forearm, and to muscles in the hand. The axillary nerve also sends signals to the brain from the shoulder joint, and from the skin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerve","offset":24},{"uri":"Brachial_plexus","surface_form":"brachial plexus","offset":63},{"uri":"Quadrangular_space","surface_form":"quadrangular space","offset":168},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":300},{"uri":"Deltoid_muscle","surface_form":"deltoid","offset":320},{"uri":"Teres_minor","surface_form":"teres minor","offset":356},{"uri":"Rotator_cuff","surface_form":"rotator cuff","offset":380},{"uri":"Triceps_brachii_muscle","surface_form":"triceps brachii","offset":427},{"uri":"Shoulder_joint","surface_form":"shoulder joint","offset":596}]}
