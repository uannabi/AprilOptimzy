{"id":532618,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor","text":"e=\"preserve\">A tensor is a mathematical object. Tensors provide a mathematical framework for solving physics problems in areas such as elasticity, fluid mechanics and general relativity. The word \"tensor\" comes from the Latin word \"tendere\" meaning \"to stretch\".\nA tensor of order zero (zeroth-order tensor) is a scalar (simple number). A tensor of order one (first-order tensor) is a linear map that maps every vector into a scalar. A vector is a tensor of order one. A tensor of order two (second-order tensor) is a linear map that maps every vector into a vector (e.g. a matrix).\nIn linear algebra, the tensor product of two vector spaces formula_1 and formula_1, formula_1, is itself a vector space. It is a way of creating a new vector space analogous of multiplication of integers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":27},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":101},{"uri":"Elasticity_(physics)","surface_form":"elasticity","offset":135},{"uri":"Fluid_mechanics","surface_form":"fluid mechanics","offset":147},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":167},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":220},{"uri":"Scalar","surface_form":"scalar","offset":313},{"uri":"Linear_mapping","surface_form":"linear map","offset":385},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":412},{"uri":"Matrix","surface_form":"matrix","offset":574},{"uri":"Linear_algebra","surface_form":"linear algebra","offset":586}]}
