{"id":532847,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAGE_questionnaire","text":"e=\"preserve\">The CAGE questionnaire is a set of four questions about a person's drinking habits. It is commonly used to test adults for alcoholism.\nBecause it is so short, doctors often start by using the CAGE questionnaire when they suspect that a patient may be an alcoholic. People can also do the CAGE questionnaire on their own.\n\"CAGE\" is an acronym for the four questions in the test.\nScoring the test.\nIf a person answers \"yes\" to a question, they score one point for that question. If they answer \"no\" to a question, they score a 0.\nIf a person scores 2 or more - meaning they answered \"yes\" to at least two of the four questions - they are likely to have a problem with alcohol.\nScoring 2 or more on the CAGE does not automatically mean that a person is an alcoholic. However, it does mean that they need more testing to see if they are an alcoholic.\nThe most important question is the last one. If a person needs a drink in the morning to feel better, it means they are having alcohol withdrawal symptoms. This means the person's body is dependent on alcohol. (The person's body is so used to having alcohol that when it does not have alcohol, even overnight, the person gets sick.) This is one of the main signs of alcoholism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alcoholic_drink","surface_form":"drinking","offset":80},{"uri":"Habit","surface_form":"habits","offset":89},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholism","offset":136},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctors","offset":172},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":347},{"uri":"Alcohol_withdrawal","surface_form":"alcohol withdrawal","offset":987},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":1006},{"uri":"Chemical_dependency","surface_form":"dependent","offset":1048},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholism","offset":1226}]}
