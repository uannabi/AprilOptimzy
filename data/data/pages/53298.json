Related Greek terms are krinein (separating out, deciding), krei- (to sieve, discriminate, or distinguish). The word moved from Greek to Latin (\"Criticus\", a judge) to French (\"critique\") to English. The words \"critic\" and \"critical\" existed in the English language from the mid-16th century, and the word \"criticism\" first made its appearance in English in the early 17th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":257},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":278},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"critic","offset":310},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":455}]}
