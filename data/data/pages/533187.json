{"id":533187,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid","text":"e=\"preserve\">In abstract algebra, a monoid is a set of elements\nThe operation need not have the commutative property.\nIn computing science common monoids include addition, multiplication, or, and. These properties are useful for various problems e.g. they allow a large set of data to be divided, processed in parallel and combined. As each part produces a monoid, the final combined result will be the same. This also works with more complex monoids, such as a map from words to the number of times they appear in a document.\nCharacter strings also form a monoid over concatenation with the empty string \" as the identity element. Examples of the two properties are \"abc\" + (\"def\" + \"ghi\") = (\"abc\" + \"def\") + \"ghi\" and \"abc\" + \" = \"+ \"abc\" = \"abc\". This is true even though \"abc\" + \"def\" \u2260 \"def\" + \"abc\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abstract_algebra","surface_form":"abstract algebra","offset":16},{"uri":"Commutative_property","surface_form":"commutative property","offset":96},{"uri":"Computing","surface_form":"computing","offset":121},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":162},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":172},{"uri":"Strings","surface_form":"strings","offset":537},{"uri":"Concatenation","surface_form":"concatenation","offset":569}]}
