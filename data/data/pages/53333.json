{"id":53333,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joiner","text":"=\"preserve\">:\" For \"joinery\" in North American sense see: Woodworking joints\"\nA joiner is a person who makes woodwork that is used for buildings. That includes things that are called \"Finish carpentry\" and \"millwork\" in the United States. Joiners make and install parts of building, for example doors, windows, stairs, wooden panelling, mouldings, shop cabinets, kitchen cabinets, and other wooden items. The skills of a joiner are somewhat between a carpenter and a cabinetmaker.\nThe terms joinery and joiner are not used often in the United States any more, but the main carpenters' trade union still calls itself the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Woodworking_joints","surface_form":"Woodworking joints","offset":58},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":135},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":224},{"uri":"Door","surface_form":"door","offset":295},{"uri":"Window","surface_form":"window","offset":302},{"uri":"Stairs","surface_form":"stairs","offset":311},{"uri":"Panelling","surface_form":"panelling","offset":326},{"uri":"Molding_(decorative)","surface_form":"mouldings","offset":337},{"uri":"Cupboard","surface_form":"cabinets","offset":353},{"uri":"Kitchen","surface_form":"kitchen","offset":363},{"uri":"Carpenter","surface_form":"carpenter","offset":451},{"uri":"Cabinet_making","surface_form":"cabinetmaker","offset":467},{"uri":"Trade_union","surface_form":"trade union","offset":585},{"uri":"United_Brotherhood_of_Carpenters_and_Joiners_of_America","surface_form":"United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America","offset":620}]}
