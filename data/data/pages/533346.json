Apparently, early trade-skins to reach Europe were prepared without wings or feet by natives. This led to the stary that these birds were beautiful visitors from paradise kept aloft by their plumes and never touched the earth until death. The relevant point is that they were killed and traded for their feathers.\nDescription.\nThe greater bird-of-paradise is the largest member in its genus.
