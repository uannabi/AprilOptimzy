{"id":53351,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassium","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hassium is a chemical element. It has been named unniloctium and eka-osmium. It has the symbol Hs. It has the atomic number 108. It is a transuranium element.\nHassium is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature. It has to be made.\nHassium oxidises like osmium, the element above it in the periodic table. Hassium oxidises to hassium tetroxide. It is less volatile than osmium tetroxide.\nHistory.\nHassium was first made in 1984. It was made at the Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. The team that made darmstadtium was led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried M\u00FCnzenberg.\nThe element was named from the Latin name for the German state of Hessen. Hessen is the state that the Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Schwerionenforschung is in.\nBefore it was named Hassium scientists could not decide what the name should be. There was an element naming controversy. The temporary IUPAC systematic element name was \"unniloctium\". The symbol with the name was \"Uno\". In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named \"hahnium\". The name hassium was adopted internationally in 1997.\nHassium-270.\nIsotope 270 of Hassium was found in December 2006. An international team of scientists led by the Technical University of Munich found it. It is a doubly magic isotope. It has an long half-life of 22 seconds. Scientists had thought that heavy and stable isotopes should exist. Some theories said Hassium-270 may be part of an island of stability.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":26},{"uri":"Mendeleev%27s_predicted_elements","surface_form":"eka","offset":78},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":123},{"uri":"Transuranium_element","surface_form":"transuranium element","offset":150},{"uri":"Radioactive","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":185},{"uri":"Synthetic_element","surface_form":"made","offset":249},{"uri":"Oxidation","surface_form":"oxidises","offset":263},{"uri":"Osmium","surface_form":"osmium","offset":277},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":313},{"uri":"Hassium_tetroxide","surface_form":"hassium tetroxide","offset":349},{"uri":"Volatility","surface_form":"volatile","offset":379},{"uri":"Osmium_tetroxide","surface_form":"osmium tetroxide","offset":393},{"uri":"Discovery_of_the_chemical_elements","surface_form":"first made","offset":432},{"uri":"1984","surface_form":"1984","offset":446},{"uri":"Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_Schwerionenforschung","surface_form":"Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Schwerionenforschung","offset":471},{"uri":"Darmstadt","surface_form":"Darmstadt","offset":518},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":529},{"uri":"Latin_(language)","surface_form":"Latin","offset":655},{"uri":"Hessen","surface_form":"Hessen","offset":690},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":800},{"uri":"Element_naming_controversy","surface_form":"element naming controversy","offset":866},{"uri":"IUPAC","surface_form":"IUPAC","offset":908},{"uri":"Systematic_element_name","surface_form":"systematic element name","offset":914},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":996},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":1119},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"Isotope","offset":1138},{"uri":"Technical_University_of_Munich","surface_form":"Technical University of Munich","offset":1236},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half-life","offset":1322},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theories","offset":1420},{"uri":"Island_of_stability","surface_form":"island of stability","offset":1464}]}
