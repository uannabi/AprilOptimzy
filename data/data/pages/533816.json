{"id":533816,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Crimes against humanity are crimes that are committed against a large group of people who have not done anything wrong. Groups who commit crimes against humanity do not hurt just one person, or just a few people. They want to hurt an entire group of people that they do not like. For example, in Nazi Germany during The Holocaust, the Nazis tried to kill all of the Jewish people in Europe. This is an example of a crime against humanity.\nUnlike war crimes, crimes against humanity can happen during peace or war.\nDefinition.\nCrimes against humanity must also be committed against a civilian population (people who are not soldiers).\nExamples.\nHowever, in the past, not all of these things were thought of as crimes against humanity. For example, crimes against humanity were first listed in 1945. However, it was not until 2002 that many forms of sexual abuse (like sexual slavery) were included as crimes against humanity.pp.\u00A08\u201310\nThe Armenian Genocide.\nThe words \"crime against humanity\" were first used after the Armenian Genocide. In 1915, the government of the Ottoman Empire killed up to 1.5 million Armenian people. The government killed men or made them do forced labor. They also forced Armenian women and children to leave their homes. On the way, the Ottoman military raped, robbed, and killed civilians.\nOn May 24, 1915, Britain, France, and Russia accused the Ottoman Empire of committing \"a crime against humanity.\"\nThe Nuremberg Trials.\nAfter World War II ended, many people who participated in The Holocaust were captured and put on trial at the Nuremberg Trials. However, the people running the Trials had to figure out how to deal with the crimes these people had committed during the Holocaust. At that time, courts could try people for war crimes. But the courts had never seen a case where a government committed such awful crimes against its own citizens.\nApartheid.\nApartheid is a system of keeping one race separate from another. One race has all the power, and the other race has none. This continues through racist laws and attitudes.\nSouth Africa practiced apartheid for decades. The government passed laws saying that different races could not live in the same areas, have sex, get married, go to school together, go to the same beaches, or even go to the same hospitals. The schools, hospitals, and other places where non-white people were allowed to go were much worse than the places for white people.\n\"Considering... that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all... rights and freedoms... [we] declare that apartheid is a crime against humanity.\"\nNo one has ever been tried for apartheid-related crimes against humanity.\nRape and sexual violence.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) opened in 2002. Its job is to look into war crimes and crimes against humanity. If possible, it tries and punishes people for these crimes. When the ICC was formed, it created a new list of crimes against humanity. This was the first time that any type of sexual abuse, other than rape, was included as a crime against humanity. The ICC includes all of these as crimes against humanity:pp.\u00A08\u201310\nThe ICC also includes all of these crimes as war crimes, if they happen as part of a war.pp.\u00A08\u201310\nIn 2008, the United Nations Security Council ruled that \u201Crape and other forms of sexual violence can [be] war crimes, crimes against humanity or a [part of] genocide.\u201D","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":42},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"large group of people","offset":78},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":310},{"uri":"The_Holocaust","surface_form":"The Holocaust","offset":330},{"uri":"Final_Solution","surface_form":"kill all of the Jewish people in Europe","offset":364},{"uri":"War_crime","surface_form":"war crime","offset":460},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":514},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":523},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilian","offset":597},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":606},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":637},{"uri":"Sexual_abuse","surface_form":"sexual abuse","offset":862},{"uri":"Sexual_slavery","surface_form":"sexual slavery","offset":881},{"uri":"Armenian_Genocide","surface_form":"Armenian Genocide","offset":1031},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":1081},{"uri":"Armenian","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":1121},{"uri":"Forced_labor","surface_form":"forced labor","offset":1180},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1285},{"uri":"Robbery","surface_form":"robbed","offset":1301},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":1348},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1357},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1369},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":1388},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1473},{"uri":"The_Holocaust","surface_form":"The Holocaust","offset":1525},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"trial","offset":1564},{"uri":"Nuremberg_Trials","surface_form":"Nuremberg Trials","offset":1577},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":1743},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":1883},{"uri":"Segregation","surface_form":"separate from another","offset":1946},{"uri":"Racist","surface_form":"racist","offset":2049},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":2076},{"uri":"Decade","surface_form":"decade","offset":2113},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sex","offset":2216},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":2225},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":2272},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":2304},{"uri":"International_Criminal_Court","surface_form":"International Criminal Court","offset":2757},{"uri":"United_Nations_Security_Council","surface_form":"United Nations Security Council","offset":3298},{"uri":"Genocide","surface_form":"genocide","offset":3442}]}
