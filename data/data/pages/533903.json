{"id":533903,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinogenital","text":"=\"preserve\">Urinogenital is a term for the common urinal and sex passage (opening) in mammals. In females it is called the vagina, and in males it is called the penis. Mammals have a sepate opening for waste (defaecation) called the anus.\nThe term contrasts with that of reptiles and birds, which have one common opening for sex, urine and defaecation. This is called the cloaca.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urinal","offset":50},{"uri":"Mammals","surface_form":"mammals","offset":86},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":123},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":161},{"uri":"Defaecation","surface_form":"defaecation","offset":209},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":233},{"uri":"Reptiles","surface_form":"reptiles","offset":271},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":284},{"uri":"Cloaca","surface_form":"cloaca","offset":372}]}
