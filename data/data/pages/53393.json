{"id":53393,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditch","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"For use of the ditch as obstacles for horses, see ditch (obstacle)\"\nA ditch is created to channel water and can be described as a small or moderate depression. A ditch can be used for drainage, to drain water from low-lying areas, alongside roadways or fields, or to channel water from a more distant source for plant irrigation. A trench can be defined as a long narrow ditch.\nDitches are commonly seen around farmland, especially in areas that have required drainage, such as The Fens in the UK and the pro-water management The Netherlands.\nRoadside ditches can provide a hazard to motorists, especially in poor weather conditions.\nFortification.\nIn military engineering and fortification, a distinction is made between a ditch and a trench. A ditch is a barrier, designed to slow down or break up an attacking force, while a trench is a cover, intended to provide protection to the defenders. In Medieval fortification, a ditch was often constructed in front of a defensive wall. When filled with water, such a defensive ditch is called a moat. Today ditches are of no importance as an obstacle for persons, but are still often used as anti-vehicle obstacles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ditch_(obstacle)","surface_form":"ditch (obstacle)","offset":65},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":113},{"uri":"Drainage","surface_form":"drainage","offset":199},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigation","offset":333},{"uri":"Trench","surface_form":"trench","offset":347},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":426},{"uri":"The_Fens","surface_form":"The Fens","offset":493},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":509},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"The Netherlands","offset":541},{"uri":"Military_engineer","surface_form":"military engineer","offset":667},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortification","offset":692},{"uri":"Trench","surface_form":"trench","offset":751},{"uri":"Barrier","surface_form":"barrier","offset":772},{"uri":"Cover_(combat_technique)","surface_form":"cover","offset":855},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"Medieval","offset":914},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortification","offset":923},{"uri":"Defensive_wall","surface_form":"defensive wall","offset":982},{"uri":"Moat","surface_form":"moat","offset":1057}]}
