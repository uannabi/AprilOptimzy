The candidates were former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of New York, and United States senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nThere are 4,764 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, so a candidate needs a simple majority of 2,383 delegates including \"superdelegates\" to win the presidential nomination.
