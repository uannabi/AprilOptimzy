{"id":534123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_the_Queens","text":"The Valley of the Queens () is a place in Egypt where wives of Pharaohs were buried in ancient times. In ancient times, it was known as Ta-Set-Neferu, meaning \u2013\"the place of beauty\".\nThe reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The place is near the worker's village in Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings. Another consideration may be the existence of a sacred grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may be associated with rejuvenation for the dead.\nThe main wadi contains 91 tombs and nearby valleys add another 19 tombs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":42},{"uri":"Pharaoh","surface_form":"Pharaoh","offset":63},{"uri":"Deir_el-Medina","surface_form":"Deir el-Medina","offset":305},{"uri":"Valley_of_the_Kings","surface_form":"Valley of the Kings","offset":328},{"uri":"Sacred","surface_form":"sacred","offset":397},{"uri":"Grotto","surface_form":"grotto","offset":404},{"uri":"Hathor","surface_form":"Hathor","offset":424},{"uri":"Wadi","surface_form":"wadi","offset":533}]}
