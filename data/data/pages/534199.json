{"id":534199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singer_Sargent","text":"John Singer Sargent (January 12, 1856 \u2013 April 14, 1925) was an American artist. He was the leading portrait painter of his day.\nDuring his career, he created about 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as many sketches and charcoal drawings. He travelled worldwide. His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris, and then moved to London.\nHis \"Portrait of Madame X\" resulted in scandal, though today it is hard to see why. She was thought to be somewhat loose sexually. In the original portrait as exhibited, one strap of her gown had fallen down her right shoulder. This suggested to some the possibility of further revelation; \"One more struggle\", wrote a critic in \"Le Figaro\", \"and the lady will be free\".\nSargent visited Spain, studied Vel\u00E1zquez, and was entranced with Spanish music and dance. He understood what the Impressionists were doing, and adopted their habit of painting \"en plein-air\". He was a big fan of Monet, and bought four of his works. His portrait of Monet shows he understood what was going on in French art at the time.\nSergent kept his American citizenship, and went back there four times. However, he remained living in London to the end of his life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":72},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portrait","offset":99},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":108},{"uri":"Oil_painting","surface_form":"oil painting","offset":168},{"uri":"Watercolor","surface_form":"watercolor","offset":202},{"uri":"Charcoal","surface_form":"charcoal","offset":244},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"America","offset":304},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":336},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":361},{"uri":"Portrait_of_Madame_X","surface_form":"Portrait of Madame X","offset":374},{"uri":"Le_Figaro","surface_form":"Le Figaro","offset":699},{"uri":"Vel%C3%A1zquez","surface_form":"Vel\u00E1zquez","offset":771},{"uri":"Impressionists","surface_form":"Impressionists","offset":853},{"uri":"Monet","surface_form":"Monet","offset":952},{"uri":"Citizenship","surface_form":"citizenship","offset":1102}]}
