It takes place every year in March in Austin, Texas, United States. It began in 1987. It has continued to grow in both scope and size every year.\nSouth by Southwest is run by the company SXSW, Inc.\nSXSW Music.\nSXSW Music is the largest music festival in the world. It had more than 2,000 performances in 2014.\nIn 1987, 700 people attended the music event. In 2009, there were over 32,000 registrants.\nBands must pay for their own travel and lodging at the event. All performers get a cash payment ($100 for solo musicians or $250 for bands) or a wristband that gives them access to all music events.\nConference.\nSXSW Film Conference lasts for five days. There are speakers, workshops, mentor sessions and more, with expert filmmakers and industry leaders.\nIn 2015, there were over 250 sessions with 735 speakers.

They do this to get an idea of how popular the movie will be in theaters.\nSXSW Interactive.\nSXSW Interactive is about new technology. The festival includes a trade show, speakers, parties, and a startup accelerator. According to a festival organizer Louis Black, SXSW Interactive \"has probably been the biggest of its kind in the world\" since 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interactive_media","surface_form":"interactive media","offset":88},{"uri":"Austin%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Austin, Texas","offset":156},{"uri":"Music_festival","surface_form":"music festival","offset":354},{"uri":"Public_speaking","surface_form":"speakers","offset":782},{"uri":"Lena_Dunham","surface_form":"Lena Dunham","offset":970},{"uri":"Jon_Favreau","surface_form":"Jon Favreau","offset":983},{"uri":"Mark_Duplass","surface_form":"Mark Duplass","offset":996},{"uri":"Ava_DuVernay","surface_form":"Ava DuVernay","offset":1010},{"uri":"Ryan_Gosling","surface_form":"Ryan Gosling","offset":1024},{"uri":"Nicolas_Cage","surface_form":"Nicolas Cage","offset":1038},{"uri":"Alejandro_Jodorowsky","surface_form":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","offset":1052},{"uri":"Tilda_Swinton","surface_form":"Tilda Swinton","offset":1074},{"uri":"Amy_Schumer","surface_form":"Amy Schumer","offset":1089},{"uri":"Sally_Field","surface_form":"Sally Field","offset":1102},{"uri":"Joss_Whedon","surface_form":"Joss Whedon","offset":1115},{"uri":"Christine_Vachon","surface_form":"Christine Vachon","offset":1128},{"uri":"RZA","surface_form":"RZA","offset":1146},{"uri":"Matthew_McConaughey","surface_form":"Matthew McConaughey","offset":1151},{"uri":"Danny_Boyle","surface_form":"Danny Boyle","offset":1172},{"uri":"Seth_MacFarlane","surface_form":"Seth MacFarlane","offset":1185},{"uri":"Catherine_Hardwicke","surface_form":"Catherine Hardwicke","offset":1202},{"uri":"Richard_Linklater","surface_form":"Richard Linklater","offset":1223},{"uri":"David_Gordon_Green","surface_form":"David Gordon Green","offset":1242},{"uri":"Harmony_Korine","surface_form":"Harmony Korine","offset":1262},{"uri":"Henry_Rollins","surface_form":"Henry Rollins","offset":1278},{"uri":"Sarah_Green","surface_form":"Sarah Green","offset":1293},{"uri":"Robert_Rodriguez","surface_form":"Robert Rodriguez","offset":1309},{"uri":"Furious_7","surface_form":"Furious 7","offset":1607},{"uri":"Neighbors_(2014_movie)","surface_form":"Neighbors","offset":1620},{"uri":"Chef_(movie)","surface_form":"Chef","offset":1633},{"uri":"21_Jump_Street_(movie)","surface_form":"21 Jump Street","offset":1641},{"uri":"The_Cabin_in_the_Woods","surface_form":"The Cabin in the Woods","offset":1659},{"uri":"Bridesmaids_(2011_movie)","surface_form":"Bridesmaids","offset":1685},{"uri":"Insidious_(movie)","surface_form":"Insidious","offset":1703},{"uri":"Girls_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Girls","offset":1734},{"uri":"Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Silicon Valley","offset":1743},{"uri":"Penny_Dreadful_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Penny Dreadful","offset":1764},{"uri":"Independent_movie","surface_form":"independently produced movies","offset":1820},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":2045},{"uri":"Louis_Black","surface_form":"Louis Black","offset":2173}]}
