She was active in Claremont McKenna's Republican group, but was asked to resign after spying on Bill Clinton's campaign for reelection. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management in Brussels, Belgium and in 2000, she graduated with a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.\nHeidi married Ted Cruz on May 27, 2001.

When Ted Cruz was criticized for not being born in the United States and running for president, Heidi defended Cruz by saying that the questioning showed that Ted Cruz was winning and his opponents wanted to defame him as a result.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":61},{"uri":"Portfolio_management","surface_form":"investment manager","offset":70},{"uri":"Goldman_Sachs","surface_form":"Goldman Sachs","offset":92},{"uri":"Spouse","surface_form":"spouse","offset":118},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":128},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":139},{"uri":"Senator","surface_form":"senator","offset":145},{"uri":"Results_of_the_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries%2C_2016","surface_form":"U.S. presidential candidate","offset":162},{"uri":"Ted_Cruz","surface_form":"Ted Cruz","offset":190},{"uri":"San_Luis_Obispo%2C_California","surface_form":"San Luis Obispo","offset":264},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":281},{"uri":"Seventh-day_Adventist_Church","surface_form":"Seventh-day Adventist","offset":310},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington","offset":397},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_1984","surface_form":"1984 presidential election","offset":514},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Arts","surface_form":"B.A.","offset":563},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":897},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":907},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard Business School","offset":961},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
