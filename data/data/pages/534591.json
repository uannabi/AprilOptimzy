It was one of the most famous comets of ancient times. Many Romans thought the comet's seven-day appearance was a sign of the deification of recently assassinated dictator, Julius Caesar (100\u201344 BC).\nCaesar's Comet was one of only five comets known to have had a negative absolute magnitude and may have been the brightest daylight comet in history. It was not periodic, and it had a parabolic orbit. The comet might now be more than 800 AU from the Sun.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Comet","surface_form":"comet","offset":120},{"uri":"Deification","surface_form":"deification","offset":216},{"uri":"Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"recently assassinated dictator","offset":231},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":263},{"uri":"Before_Christ","surface_form":"BC","offset":285},{"uri":"Absolute_magnitude","surface_form":"absolute magnitude","offset":362},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":431},{"uri":"Periodic","surface_form":"periodic","offset":451},{"uri":"Parabola","surface_form":"parabolic","offset":474},{"uri":"Astronomical_unit","surface_form":"AU","offset":528}]}
