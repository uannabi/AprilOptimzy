{"id":534895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Moivre%27s_formula","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, de Moivre's formula or de Moivre's theorem is an equation named after Abraham de Moivre. It states that for any real number \"x\" and integer \"n\",\nformula_1\nformula_1\nHere, formula_1 is Euler's number, and formula_1 is often called the polar form of the complex number formula_1.\nThe formula is very important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry. It can be proved using the trigonometry form of complex numbers by mathematical induction, with the help of some trigonometrical identities. It can also be proved using Euler's formula as well.\nBy using this formula, any equation of the form formula_1, where \"w\" is complex, can be solved.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":78},{"uri":"Abraham_de_Moivre","surface_form":"Abraham de Moivre","offset":99},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":141},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":161},{"uri":"Euler%27s_number","surface_form":"Euler's number","offset":213},{"uri":"Trigonometry","surface_form":"trigonometry","offset":377},{"uri":"Mathematical_induction","surface_form":"mathematical induction","offset":458},{"uri":"Identity_(mathematics)","surface_form":"identities","offset":520}]}
