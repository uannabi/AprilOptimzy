{"id":53510,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para%C3%ADba","text":"Para\u00EDba is one of the states of Brazil. It is in the northeastern part of the country, on the Atlantic coast. It is the easternmost point of the Americas. Jo\u00E3o Pessoa is the capital city.\nHistory.\nIn the mid-1500s, Portuguese settlers from Pernambuco founded Filip\u00E9ia de Nossa Senhora das Neves (today Jo\u00E3o Pessoa) at the mouth of the Para\u00EDba do Norte River.\nThe area was found to be perfect for making sugar. The French, the Dutch and the Portuguese all fought to have the Para\u00EDba region to grow sugarcane in. The fortress of Santa Catarina, near Jo\u00E3o Pessoa, was built to protect the city from the Dutch.\nIn late 1989 a team looking for gemstone and led by Heitor Dimas Barbosa found what some people believe are the best tourmaline crystals ever found. Copper in the crystals gives the tourmalines a bright turquoise color that had never been seen before in the gems. The mountains have been searched after this, but no more crystals have been found.\nFlag.\nThe word \"nego\" is Portuguese for \"I deny\". It refers to protests in the 1920s in Para\u00EDba against J\u00FAlio Prestes becoming the President of Brazil. State president Jo\u00E3o Pessoa supported these protests. Jo\u00E3o Pessoa joined the alliance to the overthrow of the federal government. This group caused Get\u00FAlio Vargas to become president. The rebellion lead to Jo\u00E3o Pessoa being killed.\nThe official government site of the state of Para\u00EDba says that the red is for the blood of the assassination of Jo\u00E3o Pessoa. The black is for the mourning after the assassination.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"States_of_Brazil","surface_form":"states","offset":22},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":32},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":94},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":103},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":141},{"uri":"Jo%C3%A3o_Pessoa","surface_form":"Jo\u00E3o Pessoa","offset":155},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":174},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":182},{"uri":"1500s","surface_form":"1500s","offset":208},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":215},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"settlers","offset":226},{"uri":"Pernambuco","surface_form":"Pernambuco","offset":240},{"uri":"Para%C3%ADba_do_Norte_River","surface_form":"Para\u00EDba do Norte River","offset":335},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":403},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":414},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":426},{"uri":"Sugarcane","surface_form":"sugarcane","offset":497},{"uri":"Fortress","surface_form":"fortress","offset":515},{"uri":"1989","surface_form":"1989","offset":615},{"uri":"Gemstone","surface_form":"gemstone","offset":639},{"uri":"Tourmaline","surface_form":"tourmaline","offset":724},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":735},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"Copper","offset":756},{"uri":"Turquoise","surface_form":"turquoise","offset":810},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":820},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":979},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":1017},{"uri":"1920s","surface_form":"1920s","offset":1033},{"uri":"J%C3%BAlio_Prestes","surface_form":"J\u00FAlio Prestes","offset":1058},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":1085},{"uri":"Jo%C3%A3o_Pessoa","surface_form":"Jo\u00E3o Pessoa","offset":1122},{"uri":"Brazilian_Revolution_of_1930","surface_form":"alliance","offset":1183},{"uri":"National","surface_form":"federal","offset":1216},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1224},{"uri":"Get%C3%BAlio_Vargas","surface_form":"Get\u00FAlio Vargas","offset":1254},{"uri":"Rebellion","surface_form":"rebellion","offset":1294},{"uri":"Kill","surface_form":"kill","offset":1330},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"site","offset":1362},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":1405},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":1420},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"assassination","offset":1433},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":1467},{"uri":"Mourning","surface_form":"mourning","offset":1484}]}
