{"id":535175,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-bellied_glider","text":"The yellow-bellied glider (\"Petaurus australis\") is an arboreal and nocturnal gliding possum. It lives in the native eucalypt forests right down eastern Australia, from northern Queensland to Victoria.\nHabitat.\nThe yellow-bellied glider lives in forests and woodlands in eastern Australia and is found at a range of altitudes from sea level to 1400 metres.\nIn North Queensland, the sub-species lives at over 700\u00A0m above sea level. There are 13 different populations in three places where this glider lives in North Queensland. One population lives on Mount Windsor Tableland, another on Mount Carbine Tableland, and the third lives in a linear habitat from Atherton to Kirrama on the Atherton Tableland. These three populations together have about 6000 individual gliders. With their habitat in danger, the yellow-bellied glider is classified as uncommon to rare and is named vulnerable to the tropics. This species is more widespread in southern Queensland, NSW and Victoria.\nThe yellow-bellied glider is gregarious and spends the day in a leaf-lined tree hole, which is usually shared with other members of the same family. It is also one of the most vocal possum gliders. It has a distinctive growling call that it uses as means of communication. A recording of the distinctive call can be heard at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnzGlC0Pmfo]\nIt eats nectar, honeydew, insects, pollen and a wide spread of tree sap.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":55},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":68},{"uri":"Gliding_possum","surface_form":"gliding possum","offset":78},{"uri":"Native","surface_form":"native","offset":110},{"uri":"Eucalypt","surface_form":"eucalypt","offset":117},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":126},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":153},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":178},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":192},{"uri":"Woodlands","surface_form":"woodlands","offset":258},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":316},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":420},{"uri":"Gregarious","surface_form":"gregarious","offset":1006},{"uri":"Nectar","surface_form":"nectar","offset":1356},{"uri":"Honeydew","surface_form":"honeydew","offset":1364},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":1374},{"uri":"Pollen","surface_form":"pollen","offset":1383},{"uri":"Sap","surface_form":"sap","offset":1416}]}
