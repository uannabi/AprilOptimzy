{"id":535438,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_opinion","text":"In law, a memorandum opinion is usually an unpublished legal opinion that cannot be cited as precedent. It is formally defined as: \"[1] unanimous appellate opinion that succinctly states the decision of the court; an opinion that briefly reports the court's conclusion, usu. without elaboration because the decision follows a well-established legal principle or does not relate to any point of law.\" There is no elaboration or explanation because the decision either follows a well-known legal principle or it does not relate to a point of law. A memorandum opinion is also not subject to appeal.\nGenerally, memorandum opinions follow ordinary rules, including the application of precedent and the rule of \"stare decisis\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":3},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"unpublished","offset":43},{"uri":"Legal_opinion","surface_form":"legal opinion","offset":55},{"uri":"Precedent","surface_form":"precedent","offset":93},{"uri":"Formal","surface_form":"formal","offset":110},{"uri":"Elaborate","surface_form":"elaboration","offset":412},{"uri":"Explanation","surface_form":"explanation","offset":427},{"uri":"Appeal","surface_form":"appeal","offset":589},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":644},{"uri":"Stare_decisis","surface_form":"stare decisis","offset":707}]}
