{"id":535488,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees","text":"Pharisees were Jewish leaders who composed and enforced religious law at a certain period in Jewish history. At times, the Pharisees were a political party, a social movement, and a school of thought. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundation for Rabbinic Judaism. The term 'Judaism' today almost always refers to Rabbinic Judaism.\nPaul of Tarsus, disciple of Jesus, was a Pharisee prior to his religious conversion to Christianity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":15},{"uri":"Halakha","surface_form":"religious law","offset":56},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":140},{"uri":"Social_movement","surface_form":"social movement","offset":159},{"uri":"Siege_of_Jerusalem_(AD_70)","surface_form":"destruction of the Second Temple","offset":211},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":250},{"uri":"Rabbinic_Judaism","surface_form":"Rabbinic Judaism","offset":298},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":326},{"uri":"Paul_of_Tarsus","surface_form":"Paul of Tarsus","offset":383},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":411},{"uri":"Religious_conversion","surface_form":"religious conversion","offset":446},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":470}]}
