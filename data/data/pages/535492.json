The Democratic Party presidential primary is a process of choosing delegates, or people that represent someone, to go to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. People in each state will vote on who they think will be good for the presidency, and each candidate gets a certain amount of delegates based on the number of votes they receive.\nThe primaries began on 1 February 2016 in Iowa. The remaining candidates are former first lady and secretary of state and senator Hillary Clinton and senator Bernie Sanders.\nOn June 6, 2016, the Associated Press reported that senator Hillary Clinton has gotten enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. However, their count includes some superdelegates. Since superdelegates can vote however they want at the Democratic convention, their votes could change at any time before then, so it is possible (but only remotely possible) that Clinton will not get the nomination. Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton on 12 July 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries%2C_2016","surface_form":"Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016","offset":50},{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton","surface_form":"Hillary Clinton","offset":568},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":596},{"uri":"Associated_Press","surface_form":"Associated Press","offset":633}]}
