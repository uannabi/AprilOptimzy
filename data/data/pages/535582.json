{"id":535582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_country","text":"A least developed country (LDC) is a country that the United Nations considers to be the least developed out of all the countries in the world. They normally have the lowest ratings on the Human Development Index. The idea to name LDCs started in the late 1960s. The first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in November 1971.\nClassification process.\nIndicators are used to determine whether a country is a least devleoped country.\nTo be considered a least developed country, a country must have high levels of poverty, low human resources and a vulnerable economy. The UN looks at indicators, such as gross national income, nutrition, health, education and literacy. Economic vulnerability is recorded on the Economic Vulnerability Index.\nLDC criteria are reviewed every three years. Countries may stop being considered an LDC when indicators show that they have become developed enough. Since the LDC category was created, four countries have graduated to \"developing country\" status. The first country to do this was Botswana in 1994. The second was Cape Verde, in 2007. Then Maldives in 2011, and Samoa in 2014. It is expected that Equatorial Guinea and Vanuatu will be the next countries to be promoted from LDC status.\n, there are 48 least developed countries. There are also three countries which meet the criteria for LDC status, but have asked to not be included in the index: Ghana, Papua New Guinea and Zimbabwe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":37},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":54},{"uri":"Economic_development","surface_form":"developed","offset":95},{"uri":"Human_Development_Index","surface_form":"Human Development Index","offset":189},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":510},{"uri":"Human_resources","surface_form":"human resources","offset":523},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":556},{"uri":"Indicator","surface_form":"indicators","offset":581},{"uri":"Gross_national_income","surface_form":"gross national income","offset":601},{"uri":"Nutrition","surface_form":"nutrition","offset":624},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":635},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":643},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":657},{"uri":"Economic_Vulnerability_Index","surface_form":"Economic Vulnerability Index","offset":709},{"uri":"Developing_country","surface_form":"developing country","offset":958},{"uri":"Botswana","surface_form":"Botswana","offset":1019},{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":1052},{"uri":"Maldives","surface_form":"Maldives","offset":1078},{"uri":"Samoa","surface_form":"Samoa","offset":1100},{"uri":"Equatorial_Guinea","surface_form":"Equatorial Guinea","offset":1135},{"uri":"Vanuatu","surface_form":"Vanuatu","offset":1157},{"uri":"Ghana","surface_form":"Ghana","offset":1385},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":1392},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":1413}]}
