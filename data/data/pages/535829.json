{"id":535829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_allergy","text":"Rice allergy is a type of food allergy. People allergic to rice react to some rice proteins after they eat rice or breathe in rice steam. Although some reactions might lead to severe health problems, doctors can diagnose rice allergy with many methods and help allergic people to avoid reactions.\nSymptoms.\nSome rice proteins are regarded as the causes of allergy in some people. People allergic to rice might have sneezing, runny nose, itching, asthma, stomachache or eczema after they eat rice. Besides eating rice, people with a rice allergy can have reactions breathing rice steam from cooked rice. Allergic people might have skin rashes and swellings. Moreover, they might stop breathing and die due to cardiac arrest.\nDiagnosis.\nPeople suspected of having a rice allergy can try diet avoidance on their own. First, they have to avoid rice for a couple of weeks. If they don\u2019t have symptoms in the avoidance period, but have those when exposed to rice, they are most likely allergic to rice.\nSpecific rice IgE, a kind of antibody in human blood, will rise significantly when people are allergic to rice. A blood test shows the level of the antibody.\nA skin prick test, the most efficient diagnosis, shows the reactions in a short period. After being pricked in their skin with some rice mixture, allergic people will get itching and swelling in about 30 minutes.\nTreatment.\nSome symptoms might weaken if people get allergy shots. After getting several treatments for a long time, some allergic people will not have reactions afterwards.\nSome reactions have been eased by replacing original rice with genetically modified rice. This is regarded as a new choice for rice allergic people. Reactions might lessen by staying away from rice long-term.\nPrevalence.\nUnlike other food allergies, rice allergy is relatively uncommon.It has been reported worldwide but mostly in China, Japan or Korea. Because rice is a major food in Asia, people from Asia are exposed to higher allergy risk than people from other areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Allergy","surface_form":"allergy","offset":31},{"uri":"React","surface_form":"react","offset":64},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"proteins","offset":83},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":183},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":200},{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnose","offset":212},{"uri":"Rhinorrhea","surface_form":"runny nose","offset":425},{"uri":"Itch","surface_form":"itch","offset":437},{"uri":"Asthma","surface_form":"asthma","offset":446},{"uri":"Stomachache","surface_form":"stomachache","offset":454},{"uri":"Eczema","surface_form":"eczema","offset":469},{"uri":"Rash","surface_form":"skin rashes","offset":630},{"uri":"Swell","surface_form":"swell","offset":646},{"uri":"Breathing","surface_form":"breathing","offset":683},{"uri":"Cardiac_arrest","surface_form":"cardiac arrest","offset":708},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":785},{"uri":"Avoid","surface_form":"avoid","offset":790},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":887},{"uri":"Antibody","surface_form":"antibody","offset":1026},{"uri":"Blood_test","surface_form":"blood test","offset":1111},{"uri":"Skin_allergy_test","surface_form":"skin prick test","offset":1157},{"uri":"Allergy","surface_form":"allergy shots","offset":1420},{"uri":"Genetic_engineering","surface_form":"genetically modified rice","offset":1605},{"uri":"Worldwide","surface_form":"worldwide","offset":1849},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1873},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1880},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":1889},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":1928}]}
