{"id":536054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Labor_Amendment","text":"The Child Labor Amendment is a proposed and still-pending amendment to the United States Constitution that would specifically authorize Congress to regulate \"labor of persons under eighteen years of age\". The amendment was proposed in 1924 following Supreme Court rulings in 1918 and 1922 that federal laws regulating and taxing goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 and 16 were unconstitutional.\nThe majority of the state governments ratified the amendment by the mid-1930s. However, it has not been ratified by the required three-fourths of the states according to Article V of the Constitution. None of the states have ratified it since 1937. There was not much interest in the amendment after the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which implemented federal regulation of child labor with the Supreme Court's approval in 1941.\nBecause Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, the amendment is still technically pending before the states. Currently, ratification by an additional ten states would be necessary for this amendment to become law.\nBackground.\nWith the Keating\u2013Owen Act of 1916, Congress had attempted to control interstate commerce involving goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 or 16, depending on the type of work. The Supreme Court found this law unconstitutional in \"Hammer v. Dagenhart\" (1918). Later that year, Congress attempted to levy a tax on businesses with employees under the ages of 14 or 16 (again depending on the type of work), which was struck down by the Supreme Court in \"Bailey v. Drexel Furniture\". It became apparent that a constitutional amendment would be necessary for such legislation to overcome the Court's objections.\nRatification history.\nThe following fifteen state legislatures rejected the Child Labor Amendment and did not ratify it: Connecticut (1925), Delaware (1925), Florida (1925), Georgia (1924), Louisiana (1924), Maryland (1927), Massachusetts (1925), Missouri (1925), North Carolina (1924), South Carolina (1925), South Dakota (1925, 1933 and 1937), Tennessee (1925), Texas (1925), Vermont (1925), and Virginia (1926). Although the act, on the part of state legislatures, of \"rejecting\" a proposed constitutional amendment has no legal recognition, such action does have political implications.\nOf the 48 states in the Union in 1924, five have taken no action of record on the amendment: Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York and Rhode Island. Neither have Alaska or Hawaii, which became states in 1959. Because there are now 50 states in the Union, it cannot become law unless it is ratified by 38 states (an additional 10), although when it was submitted to the states 36 ratifications were enough.\nJudicial history.\nIf ever ratified by the required number of U.S. state legislatures, the Child Labor Amendment would give the Congress of the United States jurisdiction concurrent with that of the states to legislate on the subject of child labor. In this case, child labor laws would no longer only fall under the jurisdiction of the states under the 10th Amendment. The states would have to yield to federal law where the two conflict\u2014which is normal procedure anyway. After several state legislatures initially objected to the proposal during the 1920s, a number of them re-examined their position during the 1930s and decided to ratify. Those delayed actions resulted in much controversy. They also resulted in the 1939 decision of the United States Supreme Court in the landmark case of \"Coleman v. Miller\". In this case it was determined that the Child Labor Amendment remains pending business before the state legislatures because the 68th Congress did not specify a deadline within which the state legislatures must act upon the Child Labor Amendment. The \"Coleman v. Miller\" ruling formed the basis of the unusual and belated ratification of the 27th Amendment which was proposed by Congress in 1789 and ratified more than two centuries later in 1992 by the legislatures of at least three-fourths of the 50 states.\nThe common legal opinion of federal child labor regulation reversed in the 1930s. Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 regulating the employment of those under 16 or 18 years of age. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of that law in \"United States v. Darby Lumber Co.\" (1941), which overturned \"Hammer v. Dagenhart\" (one of the key decisions that had motivated those in favor of the Child Labor Amendment). After this shift, the amendment has been described as \"moot\" and effectively part of the Constitution; the movement for it had concluded.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Propose","surface_form":"propose","offset":31},{"uri":"Pending","surface_form":"pending","offset":50},{"uri":"Amendment","surface_form":"amendment","offset":58},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":75},{"uri":"Authorize","surface_form":"authorize","offset":126},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"Congress","offset":136},{"uri":"Regulate","surface_form":"regulate","offset":148},{"uri":"Labour_(economics)","surface_form":"labor","offset":158},{"uri":"United_States_Supreme_Court","surface_form":"Supreme Court","offset":250},{"uri":"Federal_law","surface_form":"federal law","offset":294},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":322},{"uri":"Goods","surface_form":"goods","offset":329},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":347},{"uri":"Unconstitutional","surface_form":"unconstitutional","offset":390},{"uri":"Majority","surface_form":"majority","offset":412},{"uri":"US_state","surface_form":"state governments","offset":428},{"uri":"Ratification","surface_form":"ratified","offset":446},{"uri":"Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Article V of the Constitution","offset":578},{"uri":"Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938","surface_form":"Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938","offset":727},{"uri":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"federal","offset":779},{"uri":"Regulation","surface_form":"regulation","offset":787},{"uri":"United_States_Supreme_Court","surface_form":"Supreme Court's","offset":822},{"uri":"Technically","surface_form":"technically","offset":943},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1082},{"uri":"Keating%E2%80%93Owen_Act","surface_form":"Keating\u2013Owen Act","offset":1108},{"uri":"Interstate_commerce","surface_form":"interstate commerce","offset":1168},{"uri":"Hammer_v._Dagenhart","surface_form":"Hammer v.
