They are called sea because\u00A0ancient\u00A0astronomers\u00A0looked at the Moon and thought they saw seas and oceans on the Moon.\u00A0The maria cover about 16% of the surface of the Moon and most of them are in the side of the moon which is visible from Earth.\nA lunar mare, Mare Tranquillitatis was the landing site for the first manned landing on the Moon on July 20, 1969, at 20:18\u00A0UTC.
