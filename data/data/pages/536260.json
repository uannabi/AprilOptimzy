{"id":536260,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cruel and unusual punishment is punishment that causes severe suffering, pain, or humiliation. Many countries have laws against cruel and unusual punishment. There are also international laws and treaties against this type of punishment.\nHistory.\nFor most of recorded history, the death penalty was often painful on purpose. Severe historical punishments included being burned or boiled to death; cut or torn apart; crushed by stones; sawed in half; crucified; and many other extremely painful methods of execution. Punishments that were not meant to cause death were also often painful on purpose.\nLaws.\nThe exact words \"cruel and unusual punishment\" were first used in the English Bill of Rights 1689. In 1791, the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution made \"cruel and unusual punishment\" illegal in the United States. Seven years later, the British Leeward Islands used the same words in their Slavery Amelioration Act.\nHere are some examples of other laws that include protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\nUnited States.\nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that \"cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted.\" However, the Constitution does not define exactly what cruel and unusual punishments are.\nIn this decision, the Supreme Court set a precedent that if a punishment broke any of these four rules, it would be viewed as \"cruel and unusual,\" and would be illegal under the Constitution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":45},{"uri":"Severe","surface_form":"severe","offset":68},{"uri":"Suffering","surface_form":"suffering","offset":75},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":86},{"uri":"Humiliation","surface_form":"humiliation","offset":95},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":186},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaties","offset":209},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"death penalty","offset":294},{"uri":"Burn","surface_form":"burn","offset":383},{"uri":"Boil","surface_form":"boil","offset":393},{"uri":"Saw","surface_form":"saw","offset":448},{"uri":"Crucifixion","surface_form":"crucified","offset":463},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"methods of execution","offset":507},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":688},{"uri":"Bill_of_Rights_1689","surface_form":"Bill of Rights 1689","offset":696},{"uri":"Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution","offset":730},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":832},{"uri":"British_Leeward_Islands","surface_form":"British Leeward Islands","offset":870},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":1092},{"uri":"Precedent","surface_form":"precedent","offset":1319}]}
