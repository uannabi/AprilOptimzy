{"id":536379,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny","text":"e=\"preserve\">Strict scrutiny is the most stringent standard of judicial review used by United States courts. It is part of the hierarchy of standards that courts use to weigh the government's interest against a constitutional right or principle. The lesser standards are rational basis review and exacting or intermediate scrutiny. These standards are used to test statutes and government action at all levels of government within the United States.\nThe idea of \"levels of judicial scrutiny\", including strict scrutiny, was introduced in \"United States v. Carolene Products Co.\" (1938), one of a series of decisions testing the constitutionality of New Deal legislation. The first and most notable case in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government's actions valid was \"Korematsu v. United States\" (1944). In \"Korematsu\" the Court upheld the government ruling 6-9 that the need to protect the country from espionage outweighed the rights of Mr. Korematsu.\nApplicability.\nU.S. courts apply the strict scrutiny standard in two contexts: when a fundamental constitutional right is infringed, particularly those found in the Bill of Rights and those the court has deemed a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause or \"liberty clause\" of the 14th Amendment, or when a government action applies to a \"suspect classification,\" such as race or national origin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stringent","surface_form":"stringent","offset":41},{"uri":"Judicial_review","surface_form":"judicial review","offset":63},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":87},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":101},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchy","offset":127},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":140},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":179},{"uri":"Constitutional_right","surface_form":"constitutional right","offset":211},{"uri":"Principle","surface_form":"principle","offset":235},{"uri":"Rational_basis_review","surface_form":"rational basis review","offset":271},{"uri":"Intermediate_scrutiny","surface_form":"intermediate scrutiny","offset":309},{"uri":"Statute","surface_form":"statute","offset":365},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":435},{"uri":"United_States_v._Carolene_Products_Co.","surface_form":"United States v.
