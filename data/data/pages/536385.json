{"id":536385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_of_unknown_primary_origin","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP, \"occult cancer\") is a term used to describe a cancer<nowiki/> that is said to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis, but a primary tumor cannot be identified. A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a primary tumor.\nCUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer, and carries a poor prognosis in most (80 to 85%) of those circumstances. The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":98},{"uri":"Metastasis","surface_form":"metastatic","offset":140},{"uri":"Primary_tumor","surface_form":"primary tumor","offset":189},{"uri":"Biopsy","surface_form":"biopsy","offset":312},{"uri":"Prognosis","surface_form":"prognosis","offset":457}]}
