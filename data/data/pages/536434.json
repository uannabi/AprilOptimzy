{"id":536434,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDVAC","text":"=\"preserve\">EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) was one of the first electronic computers. Unlike the computer before it, the ENIAC, EDVAC operated in binary and was able to store programs.\nFunctionally, EDVAC was a binary serial computer with automatic addition, subtraction, multiplication, programmed division and automatic checking with a capacity of 1,000 44-bit words. EDVAC's average addition time was 864 microseconds and its average multiplication time was 2,900 microseconds.\nBy 1960, EDVAC was running over 20 hours a day with error-free run time averaging eight hours. EDVAC ran until 1961 when it was replaced by BRLESC. During its operational life it proved to be reliable and productive for its time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":100},{"uri":"ENIAC","surface_form":"ENIAC","offset":146},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":171},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":274},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtraction","offset":284},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":297},{"uri":"Division","surface_form":"division","offset":324},{"uri":"Microsecond","surface_form":"microsecond","offset":433},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":509},{"uri":"1961","surface_form":"1961","offset":617},{"uri":"BRLESC","surface_form":"BRLESC","offset":646}]}
