{"id":536571,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_fougasse","text":"=\"preserve\">A flame fougasse (fougasse or foo gas) is a type of mine or improvised explosive device. It uses an explosive charge to put burning liquid onto a target.\nThe flame fougasse was developed in Britain as an anti-tank weapon in the World War II invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were put in some 7,000 batteries. Most were in southern England and some in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Land_mine","surface_form":"mine","offset":64},{"uri":"Improvised_explosive_device","surface_form":"improvised explosive device","offset":72},{"uri":"Explosive","surface_form":"explosive","offset":112},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":202},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":240},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":390},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":410},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":493}]}
