{"id":536596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_citation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Case citation is a system used by legal professionals to identify past court case decisions. These are found either in series of books called reporters or law reports, or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported. Case citations are formatted differently in different jurisdictions, but generally contain the same key information.\nIn some report series, for example in England and Australia, volumes are not numbered independently of the year. So the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square brackets \" to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided, For example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).\nThe Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites. Decisions of many courts from all over the world can now be found through the website WorldLII and its member institutes.\nRather than utilizing page numbers for \"pinpoint references\", which would depend upon particular printers and browsers, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.\nThe conjunction \"versus\" is abbreviated to \"v\" in Commonwealth countries and to \"v.\" in the United States.\nPronunciation of case titles.\nIn common law countries with an adversarial system of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation \"v.\" The abbreviation represents the Latin word \"versus\", which means \"against\". When case titles are read out loud, the \"v.\" can be pronounced, depending on the context, as \"and\", \"against\", \"versus\", or \"vee\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Legal","surface_form":"legal","offset":47},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":53},{"uri":"Court_case","surface_form":"court case","offset":84},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":142},{"uri":"Reporter_(law)","surface_form":"reporters","offset":155},{"uri":"Law_report","surface_form":"law report","offset":168},{"uri":"Format","surface_form":"format","offset":285},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":320},{"uri":"Independent","surface_form":"independent","offset":469},{"uri":"Bracket","surface_form":"bracket","offset":715},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":796},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":874},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":919},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":956},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":1009},{"uri":"WorldLII","surface_form":"WorldLII","offset":1052},{"uri":"Web_browser","surface_form":"browser","offset":1198},{"uri":"Common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":1396},{"uri":"Adversarial_system","surface_form":"adversarial system","offset":1425},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":1447},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviation","offset":1529},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":1579},{"uri":"Versus","surface_form":"versus","offset":1591},{"uri":"Pronounce","surface_form":"pronounce","offset":1675},{"uri":"Context_(language)","surface_form":"context","offset":1704}]}
