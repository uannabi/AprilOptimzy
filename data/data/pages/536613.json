{"id":536613,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boynton_v._Virginia","text":"\"Boynton v. Virginia\", was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. On December 20, 1958, Bruce Boynton, a senior at Howard Law School, left Washington, D.C. on a bus to go home for Christmas to Montgomery, Alabama. At the bus terminal in Richmond, Virginia he entered the restaurant and sat in the \"white only\" section. For refusing to leave, he was arrested and convicted for violating a Virginia statute making it illegal for anyone \"without authority of law\" to remain after being forbidden to do so. He then appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court of Virginia. He maintained \u201Cthat his conviction violated the Interstate Commerce Act and the Equal Protection, Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Federal Constitution.\u201D But the state Supreme Court upheld his conviction.He next petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the conviction of the lower court. The Court held that Boynton \u201Chad a federal right to remain in the white portion of the restaurant\u201D as the Interstate Commerce Act \u201Cforbids any interstate common carrier by motor vehicle to subject any person to unjust discrimination.\u201D Justice Hugo Black delivered the majority opinion.\nEffects of \"Boynton\".\nJustices Tom C. Clark and Charles Evans Whittaker dissented in the 7-2 decision. It was the first time since 1946 the court had split over matters of racial segregation.\n\"Boynton v. Virginia\" paved the way and inspired the Freedom Riders to test the new ruling. Black and white riders rode together on Southern racially segregated buses beginning in 1961. After six months of protests and press coverage of the Freedom Riders, The Interstate Commerce Commission outlawed racial discrimination in seating passengers on interstate busses. It ordered the removal of \"whites only\" signs from all interstate bus terminals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Supreme Court of the United States","offset":45},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":154},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":195},{"uri":"Montgomery%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Montgomery, Alabama","offset":208},{"uri":"Terminal","surface_form":"terminal","offset":240},{"uri":"Richmond%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Richmond, Virginia","offset":252},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":286},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white","offset":313},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrest","offset":364},{"uri":"Conviction","surface_form":"convicted","offset":377},{"uri":"Statute","surface_form":"statute","offset":412},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":430},{"uri":"Appeal","surface_form":"appeal","offset":526},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_Virginia","surface_form":"Supreme Court of Virginia","offset":557},{"uri":"Interstate_Commerce_Act_of_1887","surface_form":"Interstate Commerce Act","offset":632},{"uri":"Equal_Protection_Clause","surface_form":"Equal Protection","offset":664},{"uri":"Due_Process","surface_form":"Due Process","offset":682},{"uri":"Commerce_Clause","surface_form":"Commerce Clause","offset":698},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Federal Constitution","offset":722},{"uri":"Writ","surface_form":"certiorari","offset":850},{"uri":"Reverse","surface_form":"reverse","offset":885},{"uri":"Common_carrier","surface_form":"common carrier","offset":1083},{"uri":"Motor_vehicle","surface_form":"motor vehicle","offset":1101},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":1147},{"uri":"Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Justice","offset":1164},{"uri":"Hugo_Black","surface_form":"Hugo Black","offset":1172},{"uri":"Majority_opinion","surface_form":"majority opinion","offset":1197},{"uri":"Tom_C._Clark","surface_form":"Tom C.
