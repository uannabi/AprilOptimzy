It is currently led by Juan Pina.\nThe party believes in classical liberalism and that government should stay out of economics. They also believe in objectivism. They believethat governments should only be able to protect people from violence, theft, fraud, and other actions that go against people's rights. The party is open to some more libertarian and anarcho-capitalism ideas. There are two groups within the party; the Objectivist and Radicals. Most party members aren't involved with these groups.\nThe party took part in the 2011 Spanish general election in Madrid and Zaragoza. They received about 7,000 votes to the Senate and over 2,000 (0.01 %) to the Congress.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":23},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":66},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":74},{"uri":"Classical_liberalism","surface_form":"classical liberalism","offset":170},{"uri":"Austrian_School","surface_form":"should stay out of economics","offset":211},{"uri":"Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)","surface_form":"objectivism","offset":262},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":347},{"uri":"Theft","surface_form":"theft","offset":357},{"uri":"Fraud","surface_form":"fraud","offset":364},{"uri":"Libertarianism","surface_form":"libertarian","offset":453},{"uri":"Anarcho-capitalism","surface_form":"anarcho-capitalism","offset":469},{"uri":"Spanish_general_election%2C_2011","surface_form":"2011 Spanish general election","offset":645},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":678},{"uri":"Zaragoza","surface_form":"Zaragoza","offset":689}]}
