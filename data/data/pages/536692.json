{"id":536692,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Canadians","text":"European Canadians (sometimes called Euro-Canadians) are Canadians with ancestry from Europe. As of 2011, there were 25,186,890 European Canadians in Canada.\nThe French were the first Europeans to live in Canada permanently. H\u00E9l\u00E8ne Desportes was the first \"white\" person born in New France. She was born in 1620.\nIn 2006, most European Canadians had English ancestry (21.03%). Other common ancestries were French (15.82%), Scottish (15.11%), Irish (13.94%), German (10.18%) then Italian (4.63%). However, 32.22% of people said they had Canadian ancestry. Because of this, some people think the numbers for the English and French ancestry are too low.\nMost European Canadians are Christian. A small number of them are Jews, Deists, Agnostics, Atheists, Muslims, Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs, Paganists/Wiccas and Unitarian Universalists. Most also speak English and French.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadians","offset":57},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":86},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":150},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":162},{"uri":"H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Desportes","surface_form":"H\u00E9l\u00E8ne Desportes","offset":225},{"uri":"New_France","surface_form":"New France","offset":279},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":350},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":406},{"uri":"Scottish_people","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":423},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":442},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":458},{"uri":"Italians","surface_form":"Italian","offset":479},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":679},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jews","offset":717},{"uri":"Deism","surface_form":"Deists","offset":723},{"uri":"Agnosticism","surface_form":"Agnostics","offset":731},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"Atheists","offset":742},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":752},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'\u00EDs","offset":761},{"uri":"Paganism","surface_form":"Paganists","offset":770},{"uri":"Wicca","surface_form":"Wiccas","offset":780},{"uri":"Unitarian_Universalism","surface_form":"Unitarian Universalists","offset":791},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":832},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":844}]}
