{"id":536705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batson_v._Kentucky","text":"\"Batson v. Kentucky\", was a landmark decision in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges in a criminal case may not be used to exclude jurors based solely on their race. The Court ruled that this practice violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case gave rise to the term \"Batson challenge\", an objection to a peremptory challenge. This is based on the standard established by the Supreme Court's decision in this case. Later decisions have resulted in the extension of \"Batson\" to civil cases. For example, in \"Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company\", the Court allowed private litigants to use this challenge. The Supreme Court also allowed it in cases are excluded on the basis of gender as in \"J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.\".\nThe principle had been established previously by several state courts, including the California Supreme Court in 1978, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1979 and the Florida Supreme Court in 1984.\nBackground.\nJames Kirkland Batson was an African American man convicted of burglary and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court by a jury composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal was based on the \"voir dire\" (jury selection) phase of the trial. During this phase potential jurors are examined by the Court, the prosecution, and the defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them in order to render a verdict. During \"voir dire\" the judge can dismiss jurors and both the prosecution and the defense have a limited number of peremptory challenges which they use to excuse any juror for any reason. Each side does this to help their case. Each side also may dismiss jurors for cause (for example, bias).\nIn \"Batson\", the judge dismissed several potential jurors for various causes. The defense peremptorily challenged nine potential jurors and the prosecution peremptorily challenged six, including all four black persons. As a result, only white persons were selected. The defense counsel moved to discharge the whole jury on the ground that the prosecutor's removal of the black jurors violated petitioner's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws. Without expressly ruling on petitioner's request for a Hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant.\nThe defendant appealed his conviction to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction. That court cited \"Swain v. Alabama\", and held that a defendant claiming lack of a fair cross section must demonstrate systematic exclusion of a group of jurors from the panel of prospective jurors. That is, the defendant had to show that not just in his case, but as a process, juries in his community did not represent a cross section of that community. Batson continued his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted \"certiorari\" to decide whether petitioner was tried \"in violation of constitutional provisions guaranteeing the defendant an impartial jury and a jury composed of persons representing a fair cross section of the community.\"\nThe Supreme Court's decision.\nJustice Marshall, concurring with the majority, called the decision \"historic\" but added: \"The decision today will not end the racial discrimination that peremptories inject into the jury-selection process. That goal can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely.\"\nDissents.\nIn his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger argued that the court's decision in \"Batson\" \"sets aside the peremptory challenge, a procedure which has been part of the common law for many centuries and part of our jury system for nearly 200 years\". He believed the majority was replacing peremptory challenges with something very similar to challenge for cause, but was unclear in explaining the standard to be applied. \"I am at a loss to discern the governing principles here,\" he wrote. \"I join my colleagues in wishing the nation's judges well as they struggle to grasp how to implement today's holding.\"\nJustice Rehnquist wrote that the majority misapplied equal protection doctrine: \"In my view, there is simply nothing 'unequal' about the state using its peremptory challenges to strike blacks from the jury in cases involving black defendants, so long as such challenges are also used to exclude whites in cases involving white defendants, Hispanics in cases involving Hispanic defendants, Asians in cases involving Asian defendants, and so on.\"\nImpact.\nWhether the principles of \"Batson\" applied retroactively to anyone convicted previously by juries whose racial composition was influenced by peremptory challenges not consistent with this opinion was for a time uncertain. In \"Allen v. Hardy\" (1986), the Court held that it did not apply retroactively to collateral review of final convictions. In \"Griffith v. Kentucky\" (1987), it decided it would apply it in cases on direct review.\nBatson challenge.\nThe term \"Batson challenge\" describes an objection to opposing counsel's use of a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror from the jury pool based on criteria the courts have found disqualifying, as race was the sole rationale for exclusion in \"Batson\".\nIn some cases, parties have appealed a verdict or judgment and asked it be made invalid because one or more peremptory challenges excluded a recognizable group from the jury. Though the \"Batson\" decision addressed jury selection in criminal trials, in 1991 the Supreme Court later extended the same rule to civil trials in \"Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company\". In 1994, in \"J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.\"., the Court held that peremptory challenges based on sex alone violated the standard established in \"Batson\" as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Landmark_decision","surface_form":"landmark decision","offset":28},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States Supreme Court","offset":59},{"uri":"Prosecutor","surface_form":"prosecutor","offset":100},{"uri":"Peremptory_challenge","surface_form":"peremptory challenge","offset":120},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"criminal","offset":147},{"uri":"Legal_case","surface_form":"case","offset":156},{"uri":"Exclude","surface_form":"exclude","offset":180},{"uri":"Juror","surface_form":"juror","offset":188},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":217},{"uri":"Violate","surface_form":"violate","offset":258},{"uri":"Equal_Protection_Clause","surface_form":"Equal Protection Clause","offset":271},{"uri":"Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Fourteenth Amendment","offset":302},{"uri":"Objection","surface_form":"objection","offset":378},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":436},{"uri":"Civil_law_(common_law)","surface_form":"civil cases","offset":565},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":582},{"uri":"Edmonson_v._Leesville_Concrete_Company","surface_form":"Edmonson v.
