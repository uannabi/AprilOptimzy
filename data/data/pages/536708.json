A person who has citizenship is called a citizen. Citizenship does not just mean that a person lives in the United States. United States citizenship gives people many rights, many protections, and also some duties.\nTypes of citizenship.\nThere are two ways that people can become citizens of the United States.\nThe first is called \"birthright citizenship.\" Anybody who is born in the United States automatically becomes a United States citizen.\nThe second is called \"naturalization.\" This is for people who were born outside the United States. A person becomes a \"naturalized citizen\" if they apply for citizenship and are approved.\nOnce a person is a naturalized citizen, they have all of the same rights, protections, and duties as a person who was born in the United States.\nRights.\nBeing a United States citizen gives a person many rights. Here is a list of some of these rights.\nDuties.\nCitizenship also comes with duties. Here are some of those duties.\nRenouncement of citizenship.\nAmericans are permitted to formally abandon their citizenship, even if they do not possess another citizenship and become stateless as a result. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was an American citizen because he was born there. He renounced his American citizenship in 2016. 5411 other Americans renounced their citizenship in the same year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":60},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":75},{"uri":"Citizenship","surface_form":"Citizenship","offset":140},{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":257},{"uri":"Duty","surface_form":"duties","offset":297},{"uri":"Apply","surface_form":"apply","offset":682},{"uri":"Approve","surface_form":"approved","offset":712},{"uri":"Duty","surface_form":"duties","offset":1009},{"uri":"Stateless","surface_form":"stateless","offset":1199},{"uri":"Boris_Johnson","surface_form":"Boris Johnson","offset":1222},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":1237},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1259}]}
