{"id":53681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He","text":"He (, unstressed) is a third-person singular pronoun used to talk about a male. \"He\" can be used in place of a male's name. When the name of a man has been the subject, then \"he\" can be used instead of that name. While \"he\" is the subject form, the word \"him\" is the object or possessive form (\"see table below\"). The word \"he\" is used for a man (or boy) where the word \"she\" would be used for a woman.\nIn the past, \"he\" and \"him\" were often used as gender-neutral pronouns. In other words, the word may have been used in a general way to refer to any person who is either male or female.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grammatical_person","surface_form":"third-person","offset":23},{"uri":"Pronoun","surface_form":"pronoun","offset":45},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":74},{"uri":"She","surface_form":"she","offset":371},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":450}]}
