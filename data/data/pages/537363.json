{"id":537363,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colobus","text":"\"Colobus\" are a genus of monkeys native to Africa. The word \"colobus\" comes from Greek \u03BA\u03BF\u03BB\u03BF\u03B2\u03CC\u03C2 which means \"docked\". This refers to their thumbs, which are just stumps.\nColobus are herbivorous. They eat leaves, fruit, flowers, and twigs. Their habitats include primary and secondary forests, riverine forests, and wooded grasslands. Their ruminant-like digestive systems help them occupy niches which other primates do not live in.\nColobus live in territorial groups of about nine individuals, with a single male with a number of females and their offspring. Newborn colobus are completely white. Mothering is shared: other members of the troop the biological mother care for an infant.\nColobus are eaten regularly by the common chimpanzee. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps hunt and eat smaller primates such as \"Colobus\" monkeys. She watched a hunting group isolate a colobus high in a tree, block all possible exits, then a chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as \"one-third of the colobus population\" in the park each year. This was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimp diet and behavior.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"Monkeys","surface_form":"monkeys","offset":25},{"uri":"Indigenous_(ecology)","surface_form":"native","offset":33},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":43},{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":181},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":203},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":211},{"uri":"Flowers","surface_form":"flowers","offset":218},{"uri":"Twig","surface_form":"twig","offset":231},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":244},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":283},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":292},{"uri":"Grasslands","surface_form":"grasslands","offset":321},{"uri":"Ruminant","surface_form":"ruminant","offset":339},{"uri":"Digestive_system","surface_form":"digestive system","offset":353},{"uri":"Niche","surface_form":"niche","offset":388},{"uri":"Primates","surface_form":"primates","offset":407},{"uri":"Common_chimpanzee","surface_form":"common chimpanzee","offset":722},{"uri":"Jane_Goodall","surface_form":"Jane Goodall","offset":741}]}
