{"id":537381,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6946","text":"NGC 6946, also known as the Fireworks galaxy, Arp 29, and Caldwell 12, is a spiral galaxy in the constellation of Cepheus and Cygnus. It is about 22.5 million light-years away from Earth. It was discovered by William Herschel in September 9, 1798. It's highly obscured by interestellar matter, and it's very close to the galactic plane. It has a third of the Milky Way\u2019s size.\nSupernovae in NGC 6946.\nFireworks Galaxy has this name because of how many supernovae happened in the galaxy. The supernovae in this galaxy occur very frequently. In the last century a total of 9 supernovae were seen from this galaxy: SN 1917a, SN 1939c, SN 1948b, SNSN 1968d, SN 1969p, SN 1980k, SN 2002hh, SN 2004et, SN2008s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spiral_galaxy","surface_form":"spiral galaxy","offset":76},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":97},{"uri":"Cepheus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Cepheus","offset":114},{"uri":"Cygnus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Cygnus","offset":126},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":159},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":181},{"uri":"William_Herschel","surface_form":"William Herschel","offset":209},{"uri":"Galactic_plane","surface_form":"galactic plane","offset":321},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":359},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":510},{"uri":"SN_1917a","surface_form":"SN 1917a","offset":612},{"uri":"SN_1939c","surface_form":"SN 1939c","offset":622},{"uri":"SN_1948b","surface_form":"SN 1948b","offset":632},{"uri":"SNSN_1968d","surface_form":"SNSN 1968d","offset":642},{"uri":"SN_1969p","surface_form":"SN 1969p","offset":654},{"uri":"SN_1980k","surface_form":"SN 1980k","offset":664},{"uri":"SN_2002hh","surface_form":"SN 2002hh","offset":674},{"uri":"SN_2004et","surface_form":"SN 2004et","offset":685},{"uri":"SN2008s","surface_form":"SN2008s","offset":696}]}
