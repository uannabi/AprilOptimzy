{"id":537403,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneaker_Pimps","text":"The Sneaker Pimps are a British trip hop group. They formed in Hartlepool, England in 1994. They are best known for their songs \"6 Underground\" and \"Spin Spin Sugar\".\nTheir song, \"6 Underground\", went to #7 on \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart.\nThe band's founding members were Liam Howe and Chris Corner. They then hired Kelli Dayton as a singer, and longtime friend Ian Pickering to write lyrics. Dayton was the original singer of the Sneaker Pimps.\nAfter the first album, the band felt that demos for the 1999 album \"Splinter\" was better for the voice of Corner. Following the tour for their first album, \"Becoming X\", they kicked Dayton out of the group. Dayton later had a solo career under the name \"Kelli Ali\".\nThe Sneaker Pimps broke up in 2005. They got back together in 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist  &lt;!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians --&gt;"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":24},{"uri":"Trip_hop","surface_form":"trip hop","offset":32},{"uri":"Hartlepool","surface_form":"Hartlepool","offset":63},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":75}]}
