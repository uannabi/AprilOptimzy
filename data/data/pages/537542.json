{"id":537542,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigating_factor_(United_States)","text":"e=\"preserve\">When a person commits a capital crime, a mitigating factor is something that might help the person avoid getting the death penalty. (\"To mitigate\" means \"to decrease.\" A \"factor\" is something that causes something else. So, in law, a mitigating factor is something that can cause punishment to decrease.)\nMitigating factors do not automatically result in decreased punishment. Judges and juries also think about aggravating factors things that are likely to cause a more severe punishment.\nAlso, mitigating factors are not an excuse for committing a crime. They may help explain what caused a person to commit a crime, but they do not mean the person did nothing wrong.\nImportance.\nIn the United States, mitigating factors are very important in death penalty cases. Mitigating factors can help prosecutors decide whether to ask for the death penalty. Also, the United States Supreme Court has ruled several times that judges and juries must think about mitigating factors before deciding on a sentence.\nSupreme Court rulings.\nAs part of this process, the judge or jury has to think about mitigating factors that might make a less severe punishment fit better.\nEach state has its own death penalty law. Each law gives a list of capital crimes in the state; aggravating factors that can make person more likely to get the death penalty; and specific mitigating factors. However, the mitigating factors listed in each state law are only examples of possible mitigating factors. Even if a state does not list a certain thing as a mitigating factor, a defendant can still bring up that factor in court.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_offence","surface_form":"capital crime","offset":37},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"death penalty","offset":130},{"uri":"Factor","surface_form":"factor","offset":184},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":240},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":293},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"Judge","offset":390},{"uri":"Jury","surface_form":"juries","offset":401},{"uri":"Aggravating_factor","surface_form":"aggravating factor","offset":425},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":702},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"death penalty","offset":758},{"uri":"Prosecutor","surface_form":"prosecutor","offset":807},{"uri":"United_States_Supreme_Court","surface_form":"United States Supreme Court","offset":874},{"uri":"Sentence_(law)","surface_form":"sentence","offset":1006}]}
