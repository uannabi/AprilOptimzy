{"id":537579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sagas are stories mostly about ancient Nordic and Germanic life. Some are entirely invented, and some have an historical basis.\nThey tell about early Viking voyages, the battles that took place during the voyages, about migration to Iceland and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland.\nThe texts are tales in prose which share some similarities with the epic, often with stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text, of heroic deeds of days long gone, \"tales of worthy men,\" who were often Vikings, sometimes pagan, sometimes Christian. They are sometimes romanticised and fantastic, but always dealing with human beings one can understand.\nThe best sagas are recognised as fine literature. \"Nj\u00E1l's Saga\", or the \"Saga of Burnt Nj\u00E1l\", is one of the most famous.\nIn Old English (Anglo-Saxon), Beowulf is a saga written in England, and so is the later Gawain and the Green Knight, written in a West Midlands dialect. These are both works of the imagination, but Layamon's \"Brut\" (about 1200 AD) is based on English history since the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\nSagas of Icelanders.\n\"The Icelandic sagas are the backbone of all... literature\" from the Nordic countries, says Roy Jacobsen (en), a translator of Sagas of Icelanders, and author.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norse","surface_form":"Nordic","offset":52},{"uri":"Germanic_tribes","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":63},{"uri":"Viking","surface_form":"Viking","offset":163},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":183},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":246},{"uri":"Feud","surface_form":"feud","offset":261},{"uri":"Old_Norse","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":320},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":350},{"uri":"Prose","surface_form":"prose","offset":382},{"uri":"Epic_poetry","surface_form":"epic","offset":427},{"uri":"Alliterative_verse","surface_form":"alliterative verse","offset":470},{"uri":"Vikings","surface_form":"Vikings","offset":584},{"uri":"Paganism","surface_form":"pagan","offset":603},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":620},{"uri":"Nj%C3%A1l%27s_Saga","surface_form":"Nj\u00E1l's Saga","offset":786},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":859},{"uri":"Beowulf","surface_form":"Beowulf","offset":886},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":915},{"uri":"Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight","surface_form":"Gawain and the Green Knight","offset":944},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1000},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":1083},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle","offset":1126},{"uri":"Backbone","surface_form":"backbone","offset":1200},{"uri":"Nordic_countries","surface_form":"Nordic countries","offset":1240},{"uri":"Roy_Jacobsen","surface_form":"Roy Jacobsen","offset":1263},{"uri":"Roy_Jacobsen","surface_form":"(en)","offset":1276},{"uri":"Sagas_of_Icelanders","surface_form":"Sagas of Icelanders","offset":1298}]}
