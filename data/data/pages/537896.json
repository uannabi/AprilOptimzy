{"id":537896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothriolepis","text":"\"Bothriolepis\" is a genus of antiarch placoderms. It was widespread and diverse in the middle to late Devonian.\n\"Bothriolepis\" lived in environments across every continent including near-shore marine and freshwater settings. Most species of \"Bothriolepis\" were small, benthic, freshwater detritivores. They got nutrients by eating decomposing plant/animal material. They were about in length. However, the largest species, \"B. maxima\", had a carapace about in length.\nOver 70 species are found across the world, but this is also typical of modern bottom dwelling species around today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":20},{"uri":"Antiarch","surface_form":"antiarch","offset":29},{"uri":"Placoderm","surface_form":"placoderm","offset":38},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"Devonian","offset":102},{"uri":"Inshore","surface_form":"near-shore","offset":182},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":193},{"uri":"Freshwater","surface_form":"freshwater","offset":204},{"uri":"Benthic","surface_form":"benthic","offset":268},{"uri":"Detritivore","surface_form":"detritivore","offset":288},{"uri":"Carapace","surface_form":"carapace","offset":442}]}
