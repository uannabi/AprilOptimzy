A public official is an official of central or local government. Officials may be appointed or elected to their office.\nOther meanings.\nThe term officer is close to being a synonym (but has more military connotations). A functionary is someone who carries out a particular role within an organisation; this is quite a close synonym for \"official\", as a noun, but with connotations closer to bureaucrat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":36},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":49},{"uri":"Mandate","surface_form":"mandate","offset":59},{"uri":"Organisation","surface_form":"organisation","offset":74},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":154},{"uri":"Appoint","surface_form":"appoint","offset":183},{"uri":"Elect","surface_form":"elect","offset":196},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":246},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":274},{"uri":"Connotation","surface_form":"connotation","offset":305},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":454},{"uri":"Bureaucrat","surface_form":"bureaucrat","offset":492}]}
