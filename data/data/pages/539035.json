{"id":539035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanchanaburi_Province","text":"Kanchanaburi (([http://www.forvo.com/word/Kanchanaburi#th Pronunciation])) is the largest of the western provinces (\"changwat\") of Thailand.\nTourists are attracted by the history of its ancient civilisation and the World War II Bridge over the River Khai (also spelt \"Khwae\").\nGeography.\nThe province is in the west of Thailand, 129\u00A0km from Bangkok, and covers a total area of approximately 19,483\u00A0km\u00B2. It is the country's third largest province, after Nakhon Ratchasima and Chiang Mai. Topographically, it is covered with timber and evergreen forests. The land has the famous River Kwai.\nSeveral national parks are in the mountainous forest areas. They include the Thungyai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, which is on the UNESCO world heritage list.\nHistory.\nArchaeological remains found in Kanchanaburi date back to the 4th century. Evidence of trade exists, saying the people traded with surrounding regions at that time. Very little is known about the historical Khmer influence in Kanchanaburi.\nVery little of the region is known before the reign of King Rama I. In 1982, many skeletons and swords were found in Phanom Thuan District. This makes people think this site was the place of the famous battle of King Naresuan against the Burmese crown-prince.\nMost foreigners are mainly aware of Kanchanaburi's recent history. During the Japanese occupation of Thailand in 1942, Allied Prisoners-of-War and Asian labourers were ordered by the Japanese to build a Thailand-Burma railway. Eventually, more than 100,000 people (16,000 allied POWs and 90,000 local Asian labourers) died from horrific working conditions.\nTransportation.\nRiver: Locals seldom use the river as a means of transportation these days, but instead for tourist-related boat rides and karaoke dinners.\nRoads: Kanchanaburi's districts are connected by three highways which also link to neighbouring provinces.\nAirport: There is no public airport in Kanchanaburi.\nRail: Kanchanburi is on the line from Bangkok Noi to Nam Tok (Sai Yok). The section from Kanchanaburi westward is what remains of the railway built by forced labour. The line from Nam Tok to Sanklaburi (next to the Burmese border) was pulled up by the British after the war. There is a short section of track along with a nearby museum at Hell Fire Pass, a few kilometres west of Nam Tok.\nBus: Air-conditioned buses serve Bangkok, while travel to provincial districts and surrounding provinces is done by non- air-conditioned buses.\nTourism.\nOnly 129\u00A0km from Bangkok, Kanchanburi is a favourite holiday destination for Bangkokians and other Thais residing in the central region.\nFor most non-Thai, Kanchanaburi historical significance stems from the movie The Bridge Over the River Kwai, which was built by forced labour during the Second World War.\nSights.\nThe Bridge Over the River Kwai was built next to the town of Kanchanaburi. The Death Railway ran all the way from the Kwae River valley up to Three Pagodas Pass. Today, only the lowest part of the railway to Nam Tok is still in use. Kanchanaburi city has a war museum and a large POW cemetery.\nIn the Sai Yok district, there is a Buddhist tiger temple where tame tigers roam freely once a day. Also in Sai Yok is the Mueang Sing Historical Park, ruins of a Khmer town and temple, as well as the Sai Yok National Park with the two Sai Yok waterfalls.\nKanchanaburi War Cemetery (Don Rak) (\u0E2A\u0E38\u0E2A\u0E32\u0E19\u0E17\u0E2B\u0E32\u0E23\u0E2A\u0E31\u0E21\u0E1E\u0E31\u0E19\u0E18\u0E21\u0E34\u0E15\u0E23\u0E14\u0E2D\u0E19\u0E23\u0E31\u0E01) The immaculately maintained cemetery contains the remains of 6,982 Allied POWs who perished during the construction of the \"Death Railway\".\nDeath Railway (\u0E17\u0E32\u0E07\u0E23\u0E16\u0E44\u0E1F\u0E2A\u0E32\u0E22\u0E21\u0E23\u0E13\u0E30), the strategic railway tracks began from Nong Pla Duk Station in Amphoe Ban Pong, Ratchaburi, and ran via Kanchanaburi across the Khwae Yai River, westbound to the Three Pagodas Pass, to end at Thanbuyuzayat in Burma. Total length within Thai territory was 300\u00A0km. The railway took only one year to complete, from October 1942\u2013October 1943. After the war, some lengths of track were demolished and some submerged under the lake of Khao Laem Dam.\nSai Yok National Park (\u0E2D\u0E38\u0E17\u0E22\u0E32\u0E19\u0E41\u0E2B\u0E48\u0E07\u0E0A\u0E32\u0E15\u0E34\u0E44\u0E17\u0E23\u0E42\u0E22\u0E04), a park since 1980, most of the area is limestone mountains with mixed deciduous forest.\nActivities.\nKirdkao Observatory (\u0E2B\u0E2D\u0E14\u0E39\u0E14\u0E32\u0E27\u0E40\u0E01\u0E34\u0E14\u0E41\u0E01\u0E49\u0E27) in Tambon Lum Rang, is a place to gain knowledge about stars and nature.\nSangkhla Buri Jungle Trek This service is offered to tourists by hotels in Amphoe Sangkhla Buri.
