{"id":53928,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Federal_District","text":"The Brazilian Federal District or Distrito Federal is a part of Brazil, which is used to shelter Bras\u00EDlia, the federal capital. It is in the centre of the country.\nHistory.\nThe government of Brazil was moved to Distrito Federal on April 21, 1960. Before this, the Brazilian Federal District used to be the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Afterwards, the municipality of Rio de Janeiro became the Estado da Guanabara (State of Guanabara), from 1960 until 1975. In 1975, the State of Guanabara and the State of Rio de Janeiro merged, to be named the state of Rio de Janeiro.\nOriginally, most of the people were local workers (called \"Candangos\"), who built the capital, and federal government workers who were sent to the new capital, Bras\u00EDlia. The capital is a planned city. It had areas built for homes, business, schools and other uses. Originally built for up to one million people, the city now has many more than one million people. Because of how the city was built, it has been hard for the city to grow. This has caused many people to live in cities around Bras\u00EDlia. A large percentage of the people of the Distrito Federal live outside the city now.\nFlag.\nThe white color is for peace. The green and yellow colors in the middle refer to the national colors of Brazil. The four yellow arrows are for the native people of Brazil. The arrows pointing into the four cardinal directions of the compass stands for the power moving out from the center. The yellow arrows also form a cross. This is a symbol of the Southern Cross carried by the explorer Pedro \u00C1lvares Cabral.\nThe flag was created by the poet Guilherme de Almeida, and was adopted by decree no. 1090 on August 25, 1969.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":64},{"uri":"Bras%C3%ADlia","surface_form":"Bras\u00EDlia","offset":97},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":119},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":177},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":191},{"uri":"April_21","surface_form":"April 21","offset":231},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":241},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":306},{"uri":"Rio_de_Janeiro","surface_form":"Rio de Janeiro","offset":322},{"uri":"Guanabara_State","surface_form":"Estado da Guanabara","offset":396},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":443},{"uri":"1975","surface_form":"1975","offset":454},{"uri":"Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)","surface_form":"Rio de Janeiro","offset":557},{"uri":"Federal_republic","surface_form":"federal","offset":672},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":680},{"uri":"Bras%C3%ADlia","surface_form":"Bras\u00EDlia","offset":733},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":804},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":814},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":1168},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":1174},{"uri":"Green","surface_form":"green","offset":1198},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":1208},{"uri":"Arrow","surface_form":"arrow","offset":1292},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"native","offset":1311},{"uri":"Cardinal_direction","surface_form":"cardinal direction","offset":1370},{"uri":"Compass","surface_form":"compass","offset":1397},{"uri":"Cross","surface_form":"cross","offset":1484},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1501},{"uri":"Southern_Cross","surface_form":"Southern Cross","offset":1515},{"uri":"Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral","surface_form":"Pedro \u00C1lvares Cabral","offset":1554},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":1604},{"uri":"Guilherme_de_Almeida","surface_form":"Guilherme de Almeida","offset":1609},{"uri":"August_25","surface_form":"August 25","offset":1669},{"uri":"1969","surface_form":"1969","offset":1680}]}
