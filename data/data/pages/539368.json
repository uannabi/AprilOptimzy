He won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the non-spherical geometry of atomic nuclei.\nEarly life.\nMottelson was born in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from Lyons Township High School in LaGrange, Illinois. He received a Bachelor's degree from Purdue University in 1947, and a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from Harvard University in 1950.\nCareer.\nIn 1950\u201351, James Rainwater (1917 \u2013 1986) and Aage Bohr (1922 \u2013 2009) had developed models of the atomic nucleus. It began learn the behaviour of the individual nucleons. Mottelson worked with Aage Bohr to share the theoretical models with experimental data.\nIn three papers which were published in 1952\u201353, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment, for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum. This work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies.\nNobel Prize (1975).\nRainwater, Bohr and Mottelson were jointly awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\".\nLater career.\nBohr and Mottelson continued to work together, publishing a two-volume monograph, \"Nuclear Structure\". The first volume, \"Single-Particle Motion,\" appeared in 1969, and the second volume, \"Nuclear Deformations,\" in 1975.\nProfessor Mottelson is a member of the Board of Sponsors of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.\nHe is a foreign fellow of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences and the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 1969, he won the Atoms for Peace Award.\nPersonal life.\nMottelson has dual citizenship. He has both Danish and American citizenship. He lives in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nMottelson was married to Nancy Jane Reno from 1948 until her death in 1975. They had two sons and one daughter. Mottelson then married Britta Marger Siegumfeldt in 1983.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":44},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":58},{"uri":"Nuclear_physics","surface_form":"nuclear physicist","offset":65},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":100},{"uri":"Atomic_nucleus","surface_form":"atomic nuclei","offset":169},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":218},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":227},{"uri":"Lyons_Township_High_School","surface_form":"Lyons Township High School","offset":255},{"uri":"LaGrange%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"LaGrange, Illinois","offset":285},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"Bachelor's degree","offset":319},{"uri":"Purdue_University","surface_form":"Purdue University","offset":342},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Ph.D.","offset":375},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":405},{"uri":"James_Rainwater","surface_form":"James Rainwater","offset":453},{"uri":"Aage_Bohr","surface_form":"Aage Bohr","offset":487},{"uri":"Atomic_nucleus","surface_form":"atomic nucleus","offset":539},{"uri":"Nucleon","surface_form":"nucleon","offset":602},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":1075},{"uri":"Monograph","surface_form":"monograph","offset":1383},{"uri":"Bulletin_of_the_Atomic_Scientists","surface_form":"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists","offset":1597},{"uri":"Bangladesh_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"Bangladesh Academy of Sciences","offset":1658},{"uri":"Norwegian_Academy_of_Science_and_Letters","surface_form":"Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters","offset":1697},{"uri":"Atoms_for_Peace_Award","surface_form":"Atoms for Peace Award","offset":1759},{"uri":"Danish_people","surface_form":"Danish","offset":1841},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":1852},{"uri":"Copenhagen","surface_form":"Copenhagen","offset":1886},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":1898}]}
