The adults can live on land or in water.\nThe genus has four species: Cope's giant salamander (\"D. copei\"), the Idaho giant salamander (\"D. aterrimus\"), the coastal giant salamander (\"D. tenebrosus\"), and the California giant salamander (\"D. ensatus\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":62},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":73},{"uri":"Salamander","surface_form":"salamanders","offset":88},{"uri":"Pacific_Northwest","surface_form":"Pacific Northwest","offset":159},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":180},{"uri":"Ambystoma","surface_form":"mole salamander","offset":242},{"uri":"Cope%27s_giant_salamander","surface_form":"Cope's giant salamander","offset":429},{"uri":"Coastal_giant_salamander","surface_form":"coastal giant salamander","offset":516},{"uri":"California_giant_salamander","surface_form":"California giant salamander","offset":568}]}
