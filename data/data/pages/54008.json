{"id":54008,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geir_Ivars%C3%B8y","text":"Geir Ivars\u00F8y (June 27, 1957 \u2013 March 9, 2006) was the main programmer at Opera Software. He and Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner were part of a research group at the Norwegian state telephone company (now known as Telenor). They made browsing software called \"MultiTorg Opera\". Telenor stopped them from working on the program, but in 1995 Ivars\u00F8y and Stephenson von Tetzchner got the rights to the software. They created a company of their own, and continued working on it.\nNow known as Opera, the Internet browser has become very popular. Opera Software has grown to more than 380 employees since it first moved to its present offices in Oslo.\nIn January of 2004, Geir Ivars\u00F8y said he wanted to resign as a board member in Opera Software, though he kept working in the company after that. In June of 2005 he was elected as a member of the nomination committee of the company.\nGeir died in March 2006 after a long battle with cancer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"June_27","surface_form":"June 27","offset":14},{"uri":"1957","surface_form":"1957","offset":23},{"uri":"March_9","surface_form":"March 9","offset":30},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":39},{"uri":"Programmer","surface_form":"programmer","offset":58},{"uri":"Opera_Software","surface_form":"Opera Software","offset":72},{"uri":"Jon_Stephenson_von_Tetzchner","surface_form":"Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner","offset":95},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":139},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":161},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":171},{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone","offset":177},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":187},{"uri":"Telenor","surface_form":"Telenor","offset":209},{"uri":"Web_browser","surface_form":"browsing","offset":229},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":238},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":330},{"uri":"Opera_(Internet_suite)","surface_form":"Opera","offset":483},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":494},{"uri":"Web_browser","surface_form":"browser","offset":503},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":578},{"uri":"Oslo","surface_form":"Oslo","offset":635},{"uri":"Board_member","surface_form":"board member","offset":704},{"uri":"Nominate","surface_form":"nomination","offset":836},{"uri":"Committee","surface_form":"committee","offset":847},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":922}]}
