More than 100,000 people visit this monument every month\nSri Harmandir Sahib\u00A0is the official name of the\u00A0Golden Gurudwara.<a href=\"Golden_Temple%23cite_note-eos-1\">a></a>\u00A0It is in the city of\u00A0Amritsar,\u00A0Punjab, India. The Gurudwara is surrounded by a sacred pool called \"sarover\"and group of buildings important to the Sikh religion. The complex is the most important pilgrimage site in Sikhism and it is also called Sri Darbar Sahib. One of these buildings in the complex is the Sri Akal Takht, the highest religious authority for Khalsa Sikhs. Another building is the langar, where a free simple vegetarian meal is served to all without any discrimination. The Gurudwara is a place of worship for men and women from all walks of life and all religions to come and worship\u00A0God.\u00A0The four entrances (representing the four directions) to get into the Harmandir Sahib also symbolise the openness of the Sikhs towards all people and religions.\nThe present-day\u00A0gurdwara\u00A0was rebuilt in 1764 by\u00A0Jassa Singh Ahluwalia\u00A0with the help of other Sikh\u00A0Misls.
