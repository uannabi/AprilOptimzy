Their use is known in the 5th century BC, but may have started earlier. To prepare them for writing, palm leaves are cooked, dried, and polished.

These leaves are between and wide, but only to high.\nOld manuscripts are prone to putrefaction, and they are commonly consumed by silverfish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":3},{"uri":"Palm_tree","surface_form":"Palm","offset":19},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":24},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":106},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooked","offset":185},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":269},{"uri":"Putrefaction","surface_form":"putrefaction","offset":370},{"uri":"Silverfish","surface_form":"silverfish","offset":418}]}
