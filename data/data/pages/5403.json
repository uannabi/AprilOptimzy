{"id":5403,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese","text":"Mandarin Chinese or simply Mandarin (;) is the language of government and education of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, with the notable exceptions of Hong Kong and Macau where a local dialect of Chinese called Cantonese is more often used.\nMandarin is one of five major regional languages of China. It spreads wider than any other regional variety, from the whole northern part of China to Yunnan Province in the southwest corner of China. In that big area there are many regional differences in vocabulary, so somebody who moves from Beijing to Yunnan could not understand people there who were speaking their own dialect, Yunnanhua. The problem is bigger than for a person in Great Britain or the United States to go to Australia. Therefore, starting in the 1920s, the Chinese government set up a national language based on the Beijing dialect and on the most widely understood words and pronunciations.\nMandarin is a standard language. It is nobody's native language, but a good average between various language forms and a common language everyone can understand and communicate with. Although it is based on the Beijing dialect, it is not the same as Beijing dialect.\nSchools use a dialect called Standard Mandarin, \"Putonghua\" (\u666E\u901A\u8BDD/\u666E\u901A\u8A71) meaning \"common (spoken) language\" or \"Hanyu\" (\u6C49\u8BED/\u6F22\u8A9E) meaning \"language of the Han\". In places such as Malaysia, it is known as \"Huayu\" (\u534E\u8BED/\u83EF\u8A9E). In Taiwan, it is known as \"Guoyu\" (\u56FD\u8BED/\u570B\u8A9E) meaning \"national language.\" There are some minor differences in these standards.\nMandarin is spoken by over 800 million people around the world, more than any other language. Most people emigrating from the Greater China region now speak Mandarin, while in past centuries most spoke Cantonese or Taishanese, another local Chinese dialect.\nStandard Mandarin is one of the six official languages at the United Nations. The others are English, French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic.\nWriting.\nMandarin is written with Chinese characters called \"H\u00E0nz\u00EC\" (\u6F22\u5B57 or \u6C49\u5B57) which literally means \"Han characters\". Each \"H\u00E0nz\u00EC\" has its own pronunciation and meaning. An ordinary dictionary will contain about 10,000 characters. Spoken Mandarin uses very many compound words, words that combine meanings the way English does in such terms as \"machine gun,\" \"fire truck,\" \"playground,\" etc.\nThe Hanzi are ideograms: one character means one \"idea\". The various concepts are derived from the ideograms by combining them. Mandarin can be also written phonetically (that is: written as it is spoken) with the Latin alphabet as you really cannot see the spelling from Hanzi characters. That is called transliteration. The most popular transliteration system is called Pinyin.\nMost characters, however, are made by combining pictures, using one to give a general meaning, and the other to represent a sound. For instance, \"\u5ABD m\u0101\" (mom) is made by adding \u5973 (n\u01DA, human female) to \u99AC (m\u01CE, horse). The \"ma\" part is only there to represent the sound.\nIn most dialects of ancient Chinese, one character was generally enough for one word, but modern spoken Mandarin uses mostly compounds like \"\u5ABD\u5ABD m\u0101ma,\" which is just \"mama,\"\nJust as the English used in Great Britain favors \"petrol\" but the English used in the United States almost always uses \"gasoline,\" different regional languages in China may use different compound words to name the same thing.\nIn Spoken Mandarin, most words are character compounds because over time Mandarin lost many sounds that existed in earlier forms of Chinese. Due to the loss of sounds, many Chinese words ended up becoming homophones, thus more characters were added to words to tell them apart. For example, the Chinese title of the poem \"Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den\" \u65BD\u6C0F\u98DF\u72EE\u53F2 is pronounced \"Sh\u012B Sh\u00EC Sh\u00ED Sh\u012B Sh\u01D0\", and every character in the poem is pronounced with the same syllable, but with different tones. In older forms of Chinese, one could have been to tell apart the different characters making up the title, as they could have sounded noticeably different from each other.\nThus, one-character words in Classical Chinese like\nto clearly distinguish such words from their homophones, otherwise the already mentioned characters could be mistaken for similar sounding characters like\nthus making spoken language difficult to understand without the compound words.\nDifference between Mandarin (Beijing Accent) and Beijing Dialect.\nMandarin is defined and designed based on Beijing accent. In China, there are over 600,000 dialects and more accents although they all use Chinese language and characters, but their pronunciation and some expressions are totally different. China must find a standard pronunciation to allow all people to understand each other and communicate. Beijing has been the capital city of China for more than 1,000 years, so China defined Beijing Accent as standard Mandarin.\nBeijing also has some local dialects that are not included by Mandarin or standard Chinese language yet. But with Beijing being the capital city as well as the political, economic, cultural and education center of China, more and more new Beijing dialects have been or will be accepted as Mandarin or standard Chinese language. The other dialects, such as Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hakka etc., have few opportunities to be included into Mandarin or standard Chinese language or be accepted by the whole of China.\nThe following samples are some Beijing dialects which are not yet accepted as standard Mandarin. \u500D\u513F: b\u00E8i'\u00E9r means 'very much'; \u62CC\u849C: b\u00E0nsu\u00E0n means 'stagger'; \u4E0D\u541D: b\u00F9l\u00ECn means 'do not worry about'; \u64AE: cu\u00F2 means 'eat'; \u51FA\u6E9C: ch\u016Bli\u016B means 'slip'; \u5927\u8001\u7237\u513F\u4EEC\u513F: d\u00E0l\u01CEoy\u00E9rmenr means 'men, males';\nThe following samples are some Beijing dialects which have been already accepted as Mandarin in recent years. \u4E8C\u628A\u5200: \u00E8rb\u01CEd\u0101o means 'not very skillful'; \u54E5\u4EEC\u513F: g\u0113menr means 'good male friends'; \u62A0\u95E8\u513F: k\u014Dum\u00E9nr means 'parsimony'; \u6253\u5C0F\u513F: d\u01CExi\u01CEo'\u00E9r means 'since childhood'","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":47},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese mainland","offset":91},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":112},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":151},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":165},{"uri":"Cantonese_language","surface_form":"Cantonese","offset":211},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabulary","offset":497},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":536},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":1118},{"uri":"Han_Chinese","surface_form":"Han","offset":1323},{"uri":"Emigration","surface_form":"emigrating","offset":1619},{"uri":"Cantonese_language","surface_form":"Cantonese","offset":1715},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1833},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1864},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1873},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1881},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":1890},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1902},{"uri":"Hanzi","surface_form":"Hanzi","offset":2307},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":2517},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"Pinyin","offset":2675},{"uri":"Homophone","surface_form":"homophone","offset":3554}]}
