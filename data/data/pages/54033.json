{"id":54033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Slovakia","text":"e=\"preserve\">An okres (in English district) is an administrative unit of Slovakia.\nSeveral districts form one region. On the other hand, one district is made of several municipalities, which are further divided into cadastral areas. The current districts exist since 1996, which at first had their own offices, but in 2004, they were abolished and replaced by the Circuit Offices, which are usually responsible for several districts (except for the Nov\u00E9 Z\u00E1mky District, which has two Circuit Offices), reducing districts to a little more than statistical units.\nSlovakia currently has 79 districts, with the city of Bratislava divided into 5 districts and the city of Ko\u0161ice divided into 4 districts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":73},{"uri":"Regions_of_Slovakia","surface_form":"region","offset":110},{"uri":"Bratislava","surface_form":"Bratislava","offset":616},{"uri":"Ko%C5%A1ice","surface_form":"Ko\u0161ice","offset":668}]}
