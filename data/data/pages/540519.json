He is probably best known for voicing and being the puppeteer of Geoff Peterson on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.\nThompson is known for his celebrity impressions, including Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Matthew McConaughey.\nEarly life.\nThompson grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, \"raised by classic television.\" He would watch as actors became different characters and began to mimic them. At age eight, his grandmother bought him a Fisher-Price tape recorder that he used to create radio-style \"shows\", voicing the host and the guests. The following year, he performed on stage in \"Peter Pan\" at the Cleveland Play House.\nDuring his junior year at Padua Franciscan High School, Thompson delivered one line for the school's production of \"Oklahoma!\" and walked off to laughter and applause. \"Then someone backstage said, 'They're clapping for you. They love you.' After that, I was hooked.\" Thompson and some of his classmates got a video camera and began making feature-length and short films, and television-style shows. He graduated from Padua in 1993.\nThompson moved to Los Angeles a few years later and performed on local television and as a stand-up comic while working toward his degree in TV, Radio and Film Production at California State University, Fullerton. He uses his middle name professionally because a \"Josh Thompson\" was already registered with the Screen Actors Guild.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Voice_actor","surface_form":"Voice actor","offset":36},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"Comedian","offset":49},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"Actor","offset":74},{"uri":"Family_Guy","surface_form":"Family Guy","offset":103},{"uri":"Geoff_Peterson","surface_form":"Geoff Peterson","offset":180},{"uri":"The_Late_Late_Show","surface_form":"The Late Late Show","offset":198},{"uri":"Craig_Ferguson","surface_form":"Craig Ferguson","offset":222},{"uri":"Morgan_Freeman","surface_form":"Morgan Freeman","offset":297},{"uri":"Robert_De_Niro","surface_form":"Robert De Niro","offset":313},{"uri":"Arnold_Schwarzenegger","surface_form":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","offset":329},{"uri":"Matthew_McConaughey","surface_form":"Matthew McConaughey","offset":355},{"uri":"Cleveland","surface_form":"Cleveland","offset":408},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":419},{"uri":"Fisher-Price","surface_form":"Fisher-Price","offset":578},{"uri":"Peter_and_Wendy","surface_form":"Peter Pan","offset":728},{"uri":"Cleveland_Play_House","surface_form":"Cleveland Play House","offset":746},{"uri":"Padua_Franciscan_High_School","surface_form":"Padua Franciscan High School","offset":794},{"uri":"Oklahoma%21","surface_form":"Oklahoma!","offset":884},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1219},{"uri":"California_State_University%2C_Fullerton","surface_form":"California State University, Fullerton","offset":1375},{"uri":"Screen_Actors_Guild","surface_form":"Screen Actors Guild","offset":1512}]}
