It was followed by the Siege of Sevastopol.\nLead up to the battle.\nThe allied armies of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire had landed on the west coast of Crimea on September 14, 1854. They meant to capture the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. They defeated the Russian army in the Battle of Alma. The allies could have attacked Sevastopol, but the British general and the French commander could not agree on a plan of attack.\nInstead, they decided to march around the city, and put Sevastopol under siege. Towards the end the allies marched to the southern coast of the Crimean and set up a supply port in the city of Balaklava. Before the siege the Russian commander retreated out of Sevastopol. On 25 October 1854, a Russian force attacked the British base at Balaklava. The attack failed before they could reach it, but the Russian had a strong hold on the British line.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crimean_War","surface_form":"Crimean War","offset":64},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British","offset":77},{"uri":"French_Army","surface_form":"French","offset":89},{"uri":"Defeat","surface_form":"defeat","offset":103},{"uri":"Imperial_Russian_Army","surface_form":"Imperial Russian Army","offset":116},{"uri":"Wound","surface_form":"wound","offset":191},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":315},{"uri":"Battlefield","surface_form":"fielded","offset":360},{"uri":"Ally","surface_form":"allies","offset":407},{"uri":"Siege_of_Sevastopol","surface_form":"Siege of Sevastopol","offset":438},{"uri":"Sardinia","surface_form":"Sardinia","offset":520},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":538},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":571},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":576},{"uri":"Crimea","surface_form":"Crimea","offset":585},{"uri":"Naval_base","surface_form":"naval base","offset":649},{"uri":"Sevastopol","surface_form":"Sevastopol","offset":663},{"uri":"Battle_of_Alma","surface_form":"Battle of Alma","offset":713},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"general","offset":788},{"uri":"Commander","surface_form":"commander","offset":811},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":900},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":980},{"uri":"Military_logistics","surface_form":"supply port","offset":1023},{"uri":"Balaklava","surface_form":"Balaklava","offset":1050},{"uri":"Retreat","surface_form":"retreat","offset":1100}]}
