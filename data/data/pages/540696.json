{"id":540696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oort","text":"Jan Hendrik Oort FRS (28 April 1900 \u2013 5 November 1992) was a Dutch astronomer.\nOort made significant contributions to understanding the Milky Way, and was a pioneer in the field of radio astronomy. His New York Times obituary called him \u201Cone of the century's foremost explorers of the universe\u201D. The European Space Agency website describes him as, \u201Cone of the greatest astronomers of the 20th century\u201D, and says he \u201Crevolutionised astronomy through his ground-breaking discoveries\u201D.\nIn 1955, Oort\u2019s name appeared in Life Magazine\u2019s list of the 100 most famous living people. He has been described as \u201Cputting the Netherlands in the forefront of postwar astronomy\u201D.\nOort proved that the Milky Way rotates. Finding that the visible mass was not enough to explain the rotation, he suggested the existence of invisible dark matter, in 1932. This is now thought to make up aboout 84.5% of the total matter in the Universe. Its gravitational pull causes \u201Cthe clustering of stars into galaxies and galaxies into connecting strings of galaxies\u201D.\nThe Solar System's Oort cloud is named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"FRS","surface_form":"FRS","offset":17},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":61},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":67},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":136},{"uri":"Radio_astronomy","surface_form":"radio astronomy","offset":181},{"uri":"New_York_Times","surface_form":"New York Times","offset":202},{"uri":"European_Space_Agency","surface_form":"European Space Agency","offset":300},{"uri":"Life_(magazine)","surface_form":"Life","offset":516},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":686},{"uri":"Dark_matter","surface_form":"dark matter","offset":815},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"Universe","offset":908},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":1042},{"uri":"Oort_cloud","surface_form":"Oort cloud","offset":1057}]}
