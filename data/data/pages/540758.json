{"id":540758,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_remainder_theorem","text":"for every polynomial formula_1 and every real number formula_1 the remainder of division of formula_1 by formula_1 is formula_1.\nThis theorem can easily be proven, but it is important for various calculations.\nProof.\nIf we divided formula_1 by formula_1, it means that we found such formula_1 and formula_1, that\nformula_1.\nLet formula_1. Then formula_1 Q.E.D.\nExample.\nLet's divide formula_1 by formula_1.\nThe theorem says that the remainder will be equal to formula_1\nSo, let's divide formula_1 by formula_1: formula_1.\nWe get that formula_1.\nUses.\nSometimes, it can be difficult to calculate formula_1 fast (if the polynomial is very big). There exist methods of fast division by formula_1, so the computing the remainder could be easier than the whole function.\nThe theorem itself is also very important for theoretical use. Its proof can easily be applied to another similar objects with little changes. It is used, for example, in the fundamental theorem of algebra, in the form of a generalisation in complex numbers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":10},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":41},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":67},{"uri":"Q.E.D.","surface_form":"Q.E.D.","offset":354},{"uri":"Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra","surface_form":"fundamental theorem of algebra","offset":941},{"uri":"Complex_numbers","surface_form":"complex numbers","offset":1008}]}
