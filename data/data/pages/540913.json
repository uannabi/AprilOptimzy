He was also the fourth husband of Catherine Parr who was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII.\nThomas was the son of Sir John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth. He grew up at Wulfhall\u00A0in Wiltshire. He was the brother to Edward Seymour, Elizabeth Seymour and Jane Seymour.\nBrother to the Queen.\nHenry VIII married Jane Seymour in May 1536, eleven days after he executed his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Thomas and his older brother Edward, both saw their fortunes rise, as they became part of the royal family.\nIn October of the following year, Jane gave birth to a son, Edward Tudor, who would become King Edward VI. Less than two weeks later, Queen Jane died as a result of giving birth, leaving Thomas as an uncle to the baby prince, and in a very powerful position.\nDeath of Henry VIII.\nKing Henry VIII died in January 1547, leaving his son, Edward\u00A0VI, as King of England. Thomas's older brother Edward Seymour, became\u00A0Lord Protector of England, in effect, ruler of England as Regent for his nephew, the king. Thomas was very jealous of his brother's power and worked to replace his brother as Lord Protector.\nIn April or May of 1547, Thomas secretly married Henry VIII\u2019s widow- Catherine Parr. As they married so soon after Henry VIII's death,\u00A0many people turned against them.\nRelationship with Elizabeth and Catherine's death.\nUpon their marriage, Thomas moved into his wife\u2019s house, where they lived with Henry VIII's youngest daughter- who would later become Elizabeth I.\u00A0When living in the same house,\u00A0Thomas had a close relationship\u00A0with Elizabeth.\nWhen his wife Catherine became pregnant in the spring of 1548, she was worried enough about her husband\u2019s relationship with Elizabeth that she sent her away to live elsewhere. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, but died soon after.\nUpon her death, Catherine left all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the richest men in England.\nThomas Seymour's downfall.\nDespite the amount of power and money Thomas now had, he was still jealous that his brother was Lord Protector. He began publicly saying that his brother was not good enough at ruling.\nBy 1548, Edward Seymour and others responsible for running the country were becoming aware that Thomas was trying to take power. Thomas would not try to explain himself.\nOn the night of 16 January 1549, Thomas was caught trying to break into the King's apartments at Hampton Court Palace. The next day, he was arrested and sent to the Tower of London.\u00A0He was found guilty of\u00A0treason.
