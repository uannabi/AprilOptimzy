{"id":540954,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raritan_River","text":"The Raritan River is a major river of New Jersey in the United States. It is receives water from the mountainous area of the central part of the state. The water empties into the Raritan Bay on the Atlantic Ocean.\nGeology.\nGeologists believe that the Raritan provided the course of the mouth of the Hudson River.\nDescription.\nThe river forms at near the border of Somerville, of Bridgewater, Branchburg, and Hillsborough Townships. It flows for <nowiki/>16\u00A0mi (25.7\u00A0km). Then it slows into in tidewater t New Brunsw. Its estuary extends 14\u00A0mi (22.5\u00A0km) m.oIt re ensing the western end of Raritan Bay at South Amboy.\nThe river has served an important water transportation route for a while. The name Raritan comes from the Raritan people, an Algonquian Native American tribe that inhabited Staten Island. In colonial days, the river allowed the development of early industry around New Brunswick. During the American Revolutionary War, the river provided a means for troop conveyance.\nWildlife and pollution.\nEfforts have been taken to reduce the pollution and increase water quality. These actions have helped the resident fish population. These include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, sunfish, catfish, trout, chain pickerel, american eels, carp and yellow perch. Some parts of the river include striped bass, fluke, winter flounder, weakfish and bluefish. Many birds live along the length of the river. Crustaceans such as blue claw crab, fiddler crabs and green crabs are also found in the tidal sections of the river. Crayfish can be found farther upstream.\nRutgers.\nThe river is also used for recreational boating, including use by the rowing team of Rutgers University in New Brunswick. The river is featured in the title of Rutgers' alma mater, \"On the Banks of the Old Raritan\", and its flooding is mentioned in the song. The musical \"1776\" mentions troops bathing in the Raritan River.\nTransportation.\nNear its mouth, the river has a New Jersey Transit railroad bridge. There is the Victory Bridge that carries Route 35 (connecting Perth Amboy and Sayreville, New Jersey); the Edison Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 9 (connecting Woodbridge Township and Sayreville); and the Driscoll Bridge, which carries the Garden State Parkway (connecting Woodbridge Township and Sayreville).\nWater supply.\nThe Raritan River is an important source of drinking water for the central portion of New Jersey.\nFlooding.\nThe Raritan River has flooding problems when massive rain from storms affects the river basin.\nIn August 2011, record flooding occurred once again after Hurricane Irene swept through the area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":38},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":56},{"uri":"Raritan_Bay","surface_form":"Raritan Bay","offset":179},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":198},{"uri":"Geologist","surface_form":"Geologist","offset":223},{"uri":"Hudson_River","surface_form":"Hudson River","offset":299},{"uri":"Somerville%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Somerville,","offset":364},{"uri":"Bridgewater_Township%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Bridgewater","offset":379},{"uri":"Branchburg%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Branchburg","offset":392},{"uri":"Hillsborough_Township%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Hillsborough Townships","offset":408},{"uri":"New_Brunswick%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Brunsw.","offset":505},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":521},{"uri":"Raritan_Bay","surface_form":"Raritan Bay","offset":588},{"uri":"South_Amboy%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"South Amboy","offset":603},{"uri":"Raritan_(tribe)","surface_form":"Raritan","offset":722},{"uri":"Algonquian_peoples","surface_form":"Algonquian","offset":741},{"uri":"Staten_Island","surface_form":"Staten Island","offset":789},{"uri":"New_Brunswick%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Brunswick","offset":881},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":907},{"uri":"Largemouth_bass","surface_form":"largemouth bass","offset":1154},{"uri":"Smallmouth_bass","surface_form":"smallmouth bass","offset":1171},{"uri":"Centrarchidae","surface_form":"sunfish","offset":1188},{"uri":"Catfish","surface_form":"catfish","offset":1197},{"uri":"Trout","surface_form":"trout","offset":1206},{"uri":"Chain_pickerel","surface_form":"chain pickerel","offset":1213},{"uri":"American_eel","surface_form":"american eel","offset":1229},{"uri":"Carp","surface_form":"carp","offset":1244},{"uri":"Yellow_perch","surface_form":"yellow perch","offset":1253},{"uri":"Striped_bass","surface_form":"striped bass","offset":1299},{"uri":"Summer_flounder","surface_form":"fluke","offset":1313},{"uri":"Winter_flounder","surface_form":"winter flounder","offset":1320},{"uri":"Weakfish","surface_form":"weakfish","offset":1337},{"uri":"Bluefish","surface_form":"bluefish","offset":1350},{"uri":"Blue_claw_crab","surface_form":"blue claw crab","offset":1427},{"uri":"Fiddler_crabs","surface_form":"fiddler crabs","offset":1443},{"uri":"Green_crabs","surface_form":"green crabs","offset":1461},{"uri":"Crayfish","surface_form":"Crayfish","offset":1524},{"uri":"Rutgers_University","surface_form":"Rutgers University","offset":1658},{"uri":"Alma_mater","surface_form":"alma mater","offset":1742},{"uri":"On_the_Banks_of_the_Old_Raritan","surface_form":"On the Banks of the Old Raritan","offset":1755},{"uri":"1776_(musical)","surface_form":"1776","offset":1845},{"uri":"New_Jersey_Transit","surface_form":"New Jersey Transit","offset":1945},{"uri":"Victory_Bridge_(New_Jersey)","surface_form":"Victory Bridge","offset":1994},{"uri":"Route_35_(New_Jersey)","surface_form":"Route 35","offset":2022},{"uri":"Perth_Amboy%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Perth Amboy","offset":2043},{"uri":"Sayreville%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Sayreville, New Jersey","offset":2059},{"uri":"Edison_Bridge_(New_Jersey)","surface_form":"Edison Bridge","offset":2088},{"uri":"U.S._Route_9_in_New_Jersey","surface_form":"U.S. Route 9","offset":2117},{"uri":"Sayreville%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Sayreville","offset":2166},{"uri":"Driscoll_Bridge","surface_form":"Driscoll Bridge","offset":2187},{"uri":"Garden_State_Parkway","surface_form":"Garden State Parkway","offset":2222},{"uri":"Woodbridge_Township%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Woodbridge Township","offset":2255},{"uri":"Hurricane_Irene","surface_form":"Hurricane Irene","offset":2567}]}
