The movies have grossed more than $2.7 billion.\nJack Sparrow.\nJack Sparrow begins the \"Curse of the Black Pearl\" as a pirate captain without a ship. He is played by Johnny Depp.\nSparrow had been captain of the \"Black Pearl\" before his first mate, Hector Barbossa led a mutiny and took over. Sparrow was left alone on a small island with nothing but a gun, one bullet and a bottle of rum. The crew thought he would either die of thirst or shoot himself. When they returned expecting to find him dead, Sparrow was gone. No one knew how he did it and many amazing stories grew around their former captain. In reality, the island was used by smugglers to hide their illegal rum. When the smugglers returned, Sparrow left the island on their ship.\nSparrow assembles a crew to help him reclaim the \"Black Pearl\". After the curse is lifted from the crew of the \"Black Pearl\", he kills Barbossa with the same gun he was left with on the island. He becomes captain of the \"Black Pearl\" again.\nElizabeth Swann.\nElizabeth Swann is the daughter of Weatherby Swann, Governor of Port Royal. She is played by Keira Knightley.\nElizabeth loves Will Turner but accepts James Norrington's marriage proposal to save Turner. The marriage is called off after Will is rescued. She marries Will Turner and they have a son, Henry. After Elizabeth gives birth, William is forced to go to sea for ten years.

He is played by Geoffrey Rush.\nBarbossa was Jack Sparrow's first mate but led a mutiny and became captain of the \"Black Pearl\".

Just as the curse is lifted, Jack Sparrow shoots Barbossa (using the bullet from the gun left with him when he was marooned). This shot kills Barbossa. However, he is brought back to life by Tia Dalma to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker.\nBarbossa was brought back to free Tia Dalma, not to rescue Jack Sparrow. Tia Dalma was actually in the process of reviving Barbossa when Jack showed up and traded the cursed monkey for a jar of dirt to ward off Davy Jones. Jack had not died yet when she started to revive Barbossa. This could also be Tia Dalma's reason for helping the others rescue Jack without charging them.\nWill Turner.\nWilliam \"Will\" Turner is a blacksmith ans self-taught swordsman who lives in Port Royal. He is played by Orlando Bloom.\nWill was found holding on to a piece of wood at sea as a boy and rescued by a ship traveling to Port Royal.

When Elizabeth is taken by Barbossa, Will teams up with Jack Sparrow to rescue her. Sparrow tells Will that Will's father, Bootstrap Turner was one of his crew on the \"Black Pearl\". Bootsrap Turner was the only one on the crew who did not want to mutiny against Sparrow.\nWill finally marries Elizabeth in \"At World's End.\" They have a son, Henry.

But when Davey Jones got a grip on him he took out his sword and was going to stab Bootstrap just as Jack sparrow took the heart out of the chest and helped Will stab it with a broken sword.\nHowever, he was accidentally resurrected when they broke the Trident of Poseidon allowing Jones to return and to search for revenge.\nDavy Jones did not cut his heart out \"for\" Calypso. He cut his heart out \"after\" she betrayed him by not showing up the day Davy Jones was allowed to make port. He was so hurt that he cut out his own heart so he would never have feelings ever again.
