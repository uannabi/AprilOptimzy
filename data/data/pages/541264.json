They are liberal conservatives who are eurosceptic (meaning they don't want Iceland to join the European Union). The party is the one of the largest in Iceland. It is currently tied with the most seats in the Althing. The chairman of the party is Bjarni Benediktsson and vice chairman is \u00DE\u00F3rd\u00EDs Kolbr\u00FAn Reykfj\u00F6r\u00F0 Gylfad\u00F3ttir.\nThe party was formed in 1929 as a result of two parties merging. The newly formed party wanted Iceland to be independent. This was later achieved in 1944. From 1929 to 2009, the Independence Party was the dominant party in the Althing.\nThe party is economically liberal, and is against getting involved with other countries problems. The party is mainly supported by fishermen and high-earners, particularly in Reykjav\u00EDk. The party also wants Iceland to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Icelandic_language","surface_form":"Icelandic","offset":24},{"uri":"Centre-right_politics","surface_form":"centre-right","offset":65},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":78},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":97},{"uri":"Liberal_conservatism","surface_form":"liberal conservatives","offset":115},{"uri":"Euroscepticism","surface_form":"eurosceptic","offset":145},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":202},{"uri":"Althing","surface_form":"Althing","offset":315},{"uri":"Bjarni_Benediktsson%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Bjarni Benediktsson","offset":353},{"uri":"Economic_liberalism","surface_form":"economically liberal","offset":681},{"uri":"Reykjav%C3%ADk","surface_form":"Reykjav\u00EDk","offset":843},{"uri":"North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization","surface_form":"North Atlantic Treaty Organization","offset":895}]}
