{"id":54127,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham","text":"Nottingham is a city (and county town of Nottinghamshire) in the East Midlands of England. The centre of Nottingham lies on the River Leen and its southern boundary follows the course of the River Trent, which flows from Stoke to the River Humber estuary. According to the 2011 census, Nottingham has a city population of 305,700. Nottingham is a member of the English Core Cities Group. It has been nicknamed \"Shottingham\" due to the high rate of gun crime.\nHistory.\nThe first evidence of settlement dates from pre-Roman times, and it is clear that the Romans also lived in the area.\nAn early name for Nottingham was \"Tigguo Cobauc\" which means \"a place of caves.\" Founded by Anglo-Saxon invaders after 600\u00A0AD, parts of the settlement have included man-made caves, dug into soft sandstone.\nNottingham was later captured by the Danes (Vikings) and in the 9th century became one of the five boroughs (fortified towns) of the Danelaw.\nThe legend of Robin Hood developed in the Middle Ages. Robin Hood is said to have lived in Sherwood Forest, which extended from the north of Nottingham to the north side of Doncaster, Yorkshire. His main opponent was the Sheriff of Nottingham. While the legends are almost certainly untrue, particularly in their details, they have had a major impact on Nottingham, with Robin Hood imagery a popular choice for local businesses and many modern tourist attractions use the legend. The Robin Hood Statue in Nottingham is outside the Nottingham Castle within walking distance from the Old Market Square.\nThree pubs in Nottingham claim the title of \"England's Oldest Pub\". The are Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem near the castle, The Bell on the Old Market Square, and The Salutation on Maid Marian Way.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, much of Nottingham's wealth was founded on the textile industry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":16},{"uri":"County_town","surface_form":"county town","offset":26},{"uri":"Nottinghamshire","surface_form":"Nottinghamshire","offset":41},{"uri":"East_Midlands","surface_form":"East Midlands","offset":65},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":82},{"uri":"River_Leen","surface_form":"River Leen","offset":128},{"uri":"River_Trent","surface_form":"River Trent","offset":191},{"uri":"Stoke-on-Trent","surface_form":"Stoke","offset":221},{"uri":"River_Humber","surface_form":"River Humber","offset":234},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_2011_census","surface_form":"2011 census","offset":273},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":308},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxons","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":677},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danes","offset":828},{"uri":"Viking","surface_form":"Viking","offset":835},{"uri":"Danelaw","surface_form":"Danelaw","offset":924},{"uri":"Robin_Hood","surface_form":"Robin Hood","offset":947},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":975},{"uri":"Sherwood_Forest","surface_form":"Sherwood Forest","offset":1024},{"uri":"Doncaster","surface_form":"Doncaster","offset":1106},{"uri":"Yorkshire","surface_form":"Yorkshire","offset":1117},{"uri":"Sheriff","surface_form":"Sheriff","offset":1154},{"uri":"Nottingham_Castle","surface_form":"Nottingham Castle","offset":1464},{"uri":"Old_Market_Square","surface_form":"Old Market Square","offset":1515},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"pubs","offset":1540},{"uri":"Ye_Olde_Trip_To_Jerusalem","surface_form":"Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem","offset":1610},{"uri":"Old_Market_Square","surface_form":"Old Market Square","offset":1669},{"uri":"The_Salutation","surface_form":"The Salutation","offset":1692},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":1806}]}
