Martin painted it in 1852.\nJohn Martin was famous for painting landscapes in the style of Romanticism. He painted pictures of the end of the world and events from the Bible.\n\"The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah\" was the last painting that Martin finished. He completed it in 1852 and sent it to the Royal Academy. In 1853 he started to paint \"The Last Judgment\", \"The Great Day of His Wrath\", and \"The Plains of Heaven\", but he became sick.
