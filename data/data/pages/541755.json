{"id":541755,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_in_the_woods","text":"e=\"preserve\">A television commercial known for its opening line \"There is a bear in the woods\" was created for the 1984 U.S. presidential re-election campaign of Ronald Reagan.\nThe commercial shows a grizzly bear wandering through a forest. The narrator of the ad, Hal Riney, talks about how the bear could be dangerous and that it would be smart to be prepared for that possibility. In the final scene a man appears and the bear takes a step back. The ad ends with a picture of Reagan and the tagline: \"President Reagan: Prepared for Peace\".\nThe bear could have either signified with the massive inflation the United States was facing, Democratic challenger Walter Mondale or the growing tensions of the Soviet Union and the Cold War.\nReagan was elected in a massive landslide in the 1984 elections winning 49 of the 50 states.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. presidential","offset":120},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":162},{"uri":"Grizzly_bear","surface_form":"grizzly bear","offset":200},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":233},{"uri":"Hal_Riney","surface_form":"Hal Riney","offset":265},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":597},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":611},{"uri":"Walter_Mondale","surface_form":"Walter Mondale","offset":659},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":705},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":726}]}
