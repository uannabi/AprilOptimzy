{"id":541825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstacle_course","text":"An obstacle course is a series of obstacles a person, vehicle or team must navigate. This is usually while being timed. Obstacle courses can include running, climbing, jumping, crawling, swimming, and balanceing with the aim of testing speed and endurance. Sometimes a course involves mental tests. In an off-road obstacle course, the driver is presented with a variety of different terrain to get over, around or through.\nMilitary.\nThe military/Army obstacle course is used (mostly in recruit training). The purpose is to familiarize recruits with the kind of military tactics they will use in combat. It is also for physical fitness, building teamwork, and evaluating problem solving skills. Typical courses involve obstacles the participants must climb over, crawl under, balance, hang, jump, etc. Puddles of muddy water, ropes, nets, and \"no touch\" restrictions are often used to make the course more difficult.\nOff-road.\nOff-road obstacle courses may be set up with a variety of different challenging situations. More common obstacles are hills, rockcrawling gates, log crawls, and mud pits. Some include underground tunnels, balance beams and water slides. Others are for the purposes of teaching high-speed driving on unimproved roads. Features include different kinds of turns, changes in elevation, navigating high speed straightaways and maneuvering vehicles through tight S-turns (so called because from above they resemble a letter \"s\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Obstacle","surface_form":"obstacle","offset":34},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":46},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":54},{"uri":"Team","surface_form":"team","offset":65},{"uri":"Navigate","surface_form":"navigate","offset":75},{"uri":"Timed","surface_form":"timed","offset":113},{"uri":"Running","surface_form":"running","offset":149},{"uri":"Climb","surface_form":"climb","offset":158},{"uri":"Jumping","surface_form":"jumping","offset":168},{"uri":"Crawl","surface_form":"crawling","offset":177},{"uri":"Swimming","surface_form":"swimming","offset":187},{"uri":"Balance","surface_form":"balance","offset":201},{"uri":"Endurance","surface_form":"endurance","offset":246},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mental","offset":285},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":383},{"uri":"Recruitment","surface_form":"recruit","offset":486},{"uri":"Training","surface_form":"training","offset":494},{"uri":"Military_tactics","surface_form":"military tactics","offset":561},{"uri":"Physical_fitness","surface_form":"physical fitness","offset":618},{"uri":"Teamwork","surface_form":"teamwork","offset":645},{"uri":"Problem_solving","surface_form":"problem solving","offset":670},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"skill","offset":686},{"uri":"Hang","surface_form":"hang","offset":784},{"uri":"Puddle","surface_form":"Puddle","offset":801},{"uri":"Mud","surface_form":"muddy water","offset":812},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":825},{"uri":"Net","surface_form":"net","offset":832},{"uri":"Restrictions","surface_form":"restrictions","offset":853},{"uri":"Rockcrawling","surface_form":"rockcrawling","offset":1051},{"uri":"Log","surface_form":"log","offset":1071},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":1297},{"uri":"Straight_(racing)","surface_form":"straightaways","offset":1330}]}
