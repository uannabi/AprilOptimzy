{"id":54185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym","text":"e=\"preserve\">A demonym or gentilic is a word used for people or the inhabitants of a place. The name of a people's language is usually the same as this word, for example, the \"English\" (language or people). Some places may not have a word for the people that live there.\nIrregular forms.\nIn many cases, both the location's name and the demonym are created by using a suffix, for example \"England\" and \"English\" and \"Englishman\". This is not always true, for example, \"France\" \u2192 \"French; Philippines \u2192 Filipino or Pilipino.\"\nIn a few cases, the name of the country is not at all related to the name of the people (\"Netherlands\" \u2192 \"Dutch\"). This is usually because the two words come from different languages. The demonyms in federal states or autonomous region can also differ in this way. For example, people in Khatumo State are often called \"reer darawiish\". Thats because the dominant tribe Dhulbahante used to be anti-colonial dervishes.Reer Darawiish\"\nDemonyms can be nouns or adjectives. In many cases the noun and adjective forms are the same (\"Canadian/Canadian\"); in other cases they are different (\"Spaniard/Spanish\").\nIn the case of Canadian provinces and territories and U.S. states, demonyms are not usually used as adjectives.\nCultural problems.\nSome peoples, mainly cultures that were taken over by European colonists, have no demonym. They may also have a demonym that is the same as the name of their nation. Examples include Iroquois, Aztec, M\u0101ori, and Czech. Often, the \"native\" languages of these people have forms that did not get used in English. In Czech, for example, the language is \"\u010Ce\u0161tina\", the nation is \"\u010Cesko\" or \"\u010Cesk\u00E1 republika\", and the people are \"\u010Ce\u0161i\".\nThe demonym for people of the United States of America has a similar problem. \"American\" can mean either someone from the United States, or someone from any part of American region or the two American continents (North America and South America). \"United Statian\" is not frequently used in English, but it exists. It is commonly used in Spanish (\"estadounidense\") and widely used in Latin American Spanish. French (\"\u00E9tatsunien(ne)\") exists but is rarely used, Portuguese (\"estado-unidense\" or \"estadunidense\") but it is not as commonly used, Italian (\"statunitense\") exists but is rarely used, and also in Interlingua (\"statounitese\"). In Esperanto the country is \"Usono\" and the demonym is \"Usonano\", avoiding confusion with \"Amerikano\". \"US American\" (for the noun) and \"US-American\" can be used but is not widely used in German (\"US-Amerikaner\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":54},{"uri":"Inhabitant","surface_form":"inhabitant","offset":68},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":115},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"language","offset":186},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"people","offset":198},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":468},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":556},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":614},{"uri":"Khatumo_State","surface_form":"Khatumo State","offset":812},{"uri":"Dhulbahante","surface_form":"Dhulbahante","offset":894},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":973},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":982},{"uri":"Spaniard","surface_form":"Spaniard","offset":1109},{"uri":"Spanish_people","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1118},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":1144},{"uri":"Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","surface_form":"provinces and territories","offset":1153},{"uri":"U.S._states","surface_form":"U.S. states","offset":1183},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1281},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1314},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonists","offset":1323},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":1418},{"uri":"Iroquois","surface_form":"Iroquois","offset":1443},{"uri":"Aztec","surface_form":"Aztec","offset":1453},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":1460},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech","offset":1471},{"uri":"Czech_language","surface_form":"\u010Ce\u0161tina","offset":1609},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"\"\u010Cesko\" or \"\u010Cesk\u00E1 republika\"","offset":1633},{"uri":"Czech_people","surface_form":"\u010Ce\u0161i","offset":1683},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":1720},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the two American continents","offset":1874},{"uri":"Interlingua","surface_form":"Interlingua","offset":2296},{"uri":"Esperanto","surface_form":"Esperanto","offset":2329},{"uri":"Usonano","surface_form":"Usonano","offset":2382}]}
