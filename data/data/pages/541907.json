He was half of pop duo Milli Vanilli, with Rob Pilatus. The duo sold multi-platinum albums around the world. But in the early 1990s, he and Pilatus were involved in one of the largest scandals in the history of pop music. It was revealed that neither he nor Pilatus really sang on any of Milli Vanilli's music whatsoever.\nAfter the scandal, the duo got themselves back together as Rob & Fab, though with limited success. Morvan had a solo comeback in the 2000s, with his album \"Love Revolution\".\nMorvan was born in Paris, France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":45},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":52},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":59},{"uri":"Dancer","surface_form":"dancer","offset":71},{"uri":"Model_(person)","surface_form":"model","offset":82},{"uri":"Milli_Vanilli","surface_form":"Milli Vanilli","offset":112},{"uri":"Rob_Pilatus","surface_form":"Rob Pilatus","offset":132},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop music","offset":300},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":604}]}
