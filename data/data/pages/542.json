{"id":542,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru","text":"Nauru, () officially the Republic of Nauru, is a sovereign island nation located in the Micronesian South Pacific. Its nearest neighbour is Banaba Island in the Republic of Kiribati, due east. Nauru is the world's smallest island nation, covering just, the smallest independent republic, and the only republican state in the world without an official capital. With 10,670 residents, it is the third least-populated country after Vatican City and Tuvalu.\nNauru is a phosphate rock island, and its primary economic activity since 1907 has been the export of phosphate mined from the island. English and Nauruan are the official languages of Nauru. The current president of Nauru is Lionel Aingimea.\nGeography.\nNauru is a oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, south of the Equator. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles. The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport, although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island. A fertile coastal strip wide lies inland from the beach.\nCoral cliffs surround Nauru's central plateau. The highest point of the plateau, called the Command Ridge, is above sea level. The only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land surrounding Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, pandanus trees, and indigenous hardwoods such as the tomano tree.\nNauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others were Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati and Makatea in French Polynesia). The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80\u00A0per cent of Nauru's land area, and has also affected the surrounding Exclusive Economic Zone; 40\u00A0per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.\nThere are only about 60\u00A0recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but there are native insects, land crabs, and birds, including the endemic Nauru Reed Warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships.\nThere are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru. Rooftop storage tanks collect rainwater, but the islanders are mostly dependent on three desalination plants housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency. Nauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February, but does not typically experience cyclones. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Ni\u00F1o-Southern Oscillation, with several significant recorded droughts. The temperature on Nauru ranges between and during the day and between and at night.\nAs an island, Nauru is vulnerable to climate and sea level change. Nauru is the seventh most global warming threatened nation due to flooding. At least 80\u00A0per cent of the land of Nauru is well elevated, but this area will be uninhabitable until the phosphate mining rehabilitation programme is implemented.\nAdministrative divisions.\nNauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts which are grouped into eight electoral constituencies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_sovereign_states","surface_form":"sovereign","offset":49},{"uri":"Island_nation","surface_form":"island nation","offset":59},{"uri":"Micronesia","surface_form":"Micronesia","offset":88},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"South Pacific","offset":100},{"uri":"Banaba_Island","surface_form":"Banaba Island","offset":140},{"uri":"Kiribati","surface_form":"Republic of Kiribati","offset":161},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":278},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":351},{"uri":"List_of_countries_by_population","surface_form":"least-populated country","offset":399},{"uri":"Vatican_City","surface_form":"Vatican City","offset":429},{"uri":"Tuvalu","surface_form":"Tuvalu","offset":446},{"uri":"Phosphate_rock","surface_form":"phosphate rock","offset":465},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":480},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":589},{"uri":"Nauruan_language","surface_form":"Nauruan","offset":601},{"uri":"Lionel_Aingimea","surface_form":"Lionel Aingimea","offset":680},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"Equator","offset":786},{"uri":"Seaport","surface_form":"seaport","offset":955},{"uri":"Canals_in_Nauru","surface_form":"channels","offset":973},{"uri":"Command_Ridge","surface_form":"Command Ridge","offset":1183},{"uri":"Coconut_palm","surface_form":"coconut palm","offset":1288},{"uri":"Buada_Lagoon","surface_form":"Buada Lagoon","offset":1333},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":1364},{"uri":"Pandanus_tectorius","surface_form":"pandanus trees","offset":1388},{"uri":"Calophyllum_inophyllum","surface_form":"tomano tree","offset":1441},{"uri":"Guano","surface_form":"phosphate rock","offset":1483},{"uri":"Banaba","surface_form":"Banaba","offset":1544},{"uri":"Kiribati","surface_form":"Kiribati","offset":1569},{"uri":"Makatea","surface_form":"Makatea","offset":1582},{"uri":"French_Polynesia","surface_form":"French Polynesia","offset":1593},{"uri":"Exclusive_Economic_Zone","surface_form":"Exclusive Economic Zone","offset":1899},{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"vascular plant","offset":2047},{"uri":"Endemic_(ecology)","surface_form":"endemic","offset":2110},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":2250},{"uri":"Nauru_Reed_Warbler","surface_form":"Nauru Reed Warbler","offset":2334},{"uri":"Polynesian_rat","surface_form":"Polynesian rat","offset":2358},{"uri":"Rainwater_tank","surface_form":"storage tanks","offset":2513},{"uri":"Desalination","surface_form":"desalination plants","offset":2594},{"uri":"Monsoon","surface_form":"monsoon","offset":2770},{"uri":"El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation","surface_form":"El Ni\u00F1o-Southern Oscillation","offset":2919},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate","offset":3115},{"uri":"Sea_level_rise","surface_form":"sea level change","offset":3127},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":3171}]}
