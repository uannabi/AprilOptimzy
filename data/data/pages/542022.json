{"id":542022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Est","text":"Grand Est (\"Great East\";;; Moselle Franconian/; Rhine Franconian: \"Gro\u00DF Oschte\";) is an administrative region in northeastern France. It was made from three former administrative regions, Alsace, Champagne-Ardenne, and Lorraine, on 1 January 2016 under the short-lived name of Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine (ACAL or ALCA) because of territorial reform which had been passed by the French law in 2014. The region sits along three water basins (Seine, Meuse and Rhine), spanning an area of, the 5th largest in France, and includes two mountain ranges (Vosges and Ardennes). It shares borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, and Switzerland, and stands partly within the European Megalopolis. The administrative capital and largest city, by far, is Strasbourg. The East of France has a interesting culture, being situated at a between the Latin and Germanic worlds which is shown in the variety of languages spoken there (Alsatian, Champenois, Lorraine Franconian etc.). Most of today's Grand Est region was thought to be \"Eastern\" as early as the 8th century, when it owned the southern part of the Francian territory of Austrasia. The city of Reims, would later play a ceremonial role in French history as the traditional site of the coronation of the kings of France. The Champagne fairs played an important part in the economy of medieval Europe as well. Alsace and Lorraine did well in the influence of the Holy Roman Empire for most of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The region is home to traditions (the celebration of Saint Nicholas Day, Christmas markets, or traditions involving the Easter hare in Alsace and Lorraine). Alsace-Moselle has to follow local law for historical reasons. With a long industrial history as well and its agriculture and tourism (arts, cuisine, sightseeing etc.), the East of France has one of the largest economic production levels in the country.\n\"Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine\" was the old name for the region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moselle_Franconian","surface_form":"Moselle Franconian","offset":27},{"uri":"Rhine_Franconian","surface_form":"Rhine Franconian","offset":48},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"administrative region","offset":88},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":126},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":188},{"uri":"Champagne-Ardenne","surface_form":"Champagne-Ardenne","offset":196},{"uri":"Lorraine","surface_form":"Lorraine","offset":219},{"uri":"Seine","surface_form":"Seine","offset":447},{"uri":"Meuse","surface_form":"Meuse","offset":454},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":464},{"uri":"Vosges","surface_form":"Vosges","offset":554},{"uri":"Ardennes","surface_form":"Ardennes","offset":565},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":599},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":608},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":620},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":633},{"uri":"European_Megalopolis","surface_form":"European Megalopolis","offset":675},{"uri":"Administrative_capital","surface_form":"administrative capital","offset":701},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":753},{"uri":"Latin_world","surface_form":"Latin","offset":843},{"uri":"Germanic_world","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":853},{"uri":"Alsatian_language","surface_form":"Alsatian","offset":926},{"uri":"Champenois_language","surface_form":"Champenois","offset":936},{"uri":"Lorraine_Franconian","surface_form":"Lorraine Franconian","offset":948},{"uri":"Francia","surface_form":"Francian","offset":1104},{"uri":"Austrasia","surface_form":"Austrasia","offset":1126},{"uri":"Reims","surface_form":"Reims","offset":1149},{"uri":"Coronation","surface_form":"coronation","offset":1240},{"uri":"Champagne_fairs","surface_form":"Champagne fairs","offset":1279},{"uri":"Medieval_Europe","surface_form":"medieval Europe","offset":1338},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":1416},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":1450},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":1466},{"uri":"Saint_Nicholas_Day","surface_form":"Saint Nicholas Day","offset":1532},{"uri":"Christmas_market","surface_form":"Christmas markets","offset":1552},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":1746}]}
