{"id":542142,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Islands","text":"The Sea Islands are a chain of tidal and barrier islands on the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean coast of the United States.\nThere are over a hundred of them. They are between the mouths of the Santee and St. Johns Rivers along the coast of the US states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\nBarrier islands like these may change during storms. They absorb energy and protect the coastlines. Indirectly, they may help to create areas of protected waters where wetlands may flourish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Barrier","surface_form":"barrier","offset":41},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":77},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":105},{"uri":"Santee_River","surface_form":"Santee","offset":189},{"uri":"St._Johns_River","surface_form":"St. Johns River","offset":200},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"US states","offset":240},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":253},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":269},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":282},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":336},{"uri":"Absorb","surface_form":"absorb","offset":349},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":356},{"uri":"Coastline","surface_form":"coastline","offset":379},{"uri":"Wetlands","surface_form":"wetlands","offset":459}]}
