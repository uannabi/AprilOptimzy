{"id":54221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_critic","text":"e=\"preserve\">A music critic is someone who writes about concerts that have taken place or new music that has been written. They write reviews about this in newspapers or journals. What they write is called musical criticism.\nWhen people write about the history of music or compare musical styles, this is called musicology. Musical criticism is about what is going on in the musical world at the moment.\nResponsibilities.\nMusic critics can have a lot of influence on a musician\u2019s success. If a musician gets a bad review people may not bother to go and hear him. If he has a very good review people will think he must be good and they will all want to hear him.\nOccasionally it can happen that a new piece of music has such a terrible review that everyone wants to go and hear how terrible it is. They may then find that they like it and the music might become famous. This is called a \u201Csucc\u00E8s de scandale\u201D (French for \u201Cscandalous success\u201D). Stravinsky\u2019s \"Rite of Spring\" (1913) is a good example.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Concert","surface_form":"concert","offset":56},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":156},{"uri":"Journal","surface_form":"journal","offset":170},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":253},{"uri":"Musicology","surface_form":"musicology","offset":312},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"critic","offset":428},{"uri":"Igor_Stravinsky","surface_form":"Stravinsky\u2019s","offset":942},{"uri":"Rite_of_Spring","surface_form":"Rite of Spring","offset":956}]}
