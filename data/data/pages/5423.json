{"id":5423,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams","text":"John Adams, Jr. (October 30, 1735 \u2013 July 4, 1826) was the second President of the United States (1797\u20131801), and father of the sixth President, John Quincy Adams. He was also the first Vice President of the United States (1789\u20131797).\nAdams was born in Braintree, Massachusetts. He was the son of Lt. Col. John Adams, Sr. (1691-1761) and Susanna Boylston (1708-1797), and he was the cousin of the philosopher Samuel Adams. He went to Harvard College. He married Abigail Adams in 1764.\nRevolution years.\nAdams wanted the Thirteen Colonies to be free from Great Britain. However, Adams was fair and thought every person should be treated fairly. Even though he did not want British soldiers in Boston, he was the lawyer who defended the British soldiers who were involved in the Boston Massacre.\nAdams was a representative from Massachusetts during the Second Continental Congress. He helped Thomas Jefferson write the United States Declaration of Independence. During the American Revolutionary War, Adams helped make peace with Great Britain. He served in France, the Netherlands and England as an ambassador in the 1780s.\nVice President.\nAdams was the first vice president under George Washington. After Washington chose not to run again, Adams won the 1796 election. Adams is thought to have been the first president to belong to a political party, but like George Washington, he thought himself above any particular party. He ran for president on the Federalist ticket. He beat Thomas Jefferson of the Democratic-Republican Party. President candidates and vice president candidates did not run together like they do today. Since Jefferson got the second highest number of votes, he became vice president.\nPresident.\nDuring his term, he resolved a conflict against France peacefully. He also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts which made it illegal to say bad things about the government. Many people did not like those acts because they felt it took away their freedom of speech. Adams was not re-elected president and lost to Thomas Jefferson. The Federalist Party was not as popular as it was when Adams was elected. One of his last acts as president was to make John Marshall the Chief Justice of the United States. This made sure that the Federalist Party would still be important.\nOf the first five U.S. presidents, Adams was the only one who did not own slaves. He was also the only one to be from New England.\nDeath.\nAdams died on July 4, 1826 of heart failure. This was the same day that Thomas Jefferson died, and was also exactly 50 years after the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_(United_States)","surface_form":"President","offset":65},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":82},{"uri":"John_Quincy_Adams","surface_form":"John Quincy Adams","offset":144},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President of the United States","offset":185},{"uri":"Braintree%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Braintree","offset":252},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":263},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":396},{"uri":"Samuel_Adams","surface_form":"Samuel Adams","offset":408},{"uri":"Harvard_College","surface_form":"Harvard College","offset":433},{"uri":"Abigail_Adams","surface_form":"Abigail Adams","offset":461},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"Thirteen Colonies","offset":519},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":553},{"uri":"Boston_Massacre","surface_form":"Boston Massacre","offset":776},{"uri":"Second_Continental_Congress","surface_form":"Second Continental Congress","offset":850},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":889},{"uri":"United_States_Declaration_of_Independence","surface_form":"United States Declaration of Independence","offset":916},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":970},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"ambassador","offset":1097},{"uri":"Federalist_Party","surface_form":"Federalist","offset":1453},{"uri":"Democratic-Republican_Party","surface_form":"Democratic-Republican Party","offset":1504},{"uri":"Alien_and_Sedition_Acts","surface_form":"Alien and Sedition Acts","offset":1804},{"uri":"John_Marshall","surface_form":"John Marshall","offset":2167},{"uri":"Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Chief Justice of the United States","offset":2185},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":2406},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":2456},{"uri":"Declaration_of_Independence","surface_form":"Declaration of Independence","offset":2561}]}
