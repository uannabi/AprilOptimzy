{"id":54230,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Batman","text":"John Batman (21 January 1801 \u2013 6 May 1839) was an Australian farmer and businessman who was one of the first white people to live in Melbourne.\nBatman was born in Rosehill, Parramatta (part of Sydney), and spent time in Tasmania (then called Van Diemen's Land). In Tasmania he started farming on land the government gave him. He brought more land. During this time, he was involved in conflicts with the Tasmanian Aborigines.\nIn December 1825, or early 1826, Batman captured the notorious bushranger (a kind of robber), Matthew Brady.\nBatman asked to be given land in the Westernport area of Victoria, but the government rejected him. So, in 1835, as a leading member of the Port Phillip Association he sailed for the mainland of Australia in the schooner \"Rebecca\" and explored much of Port Phillip Bay. Batman made an agreement, now known as Batman's Treaty, with some local Aborigines to rent their land in return for things like knives and flour every year. Probably the Wurundjeri people did not understand the agreement. In any case, the Governor of New South Wales said the agreement was not legal the land was owned by the Government rather than the Aborigines.\nBatman became very unhealthy after 1835, and he separated from his wife, convict Elizabeth Callaghan. They had had seven daughters and a son. His son drowned in the Yarra River. In his last months the local Aborigines looked after him.\nBatman is remembered by some statues around Melbourne, and is buried in the Fawkner Cemetery, a cemetery named after his fellow colonist John Pascoe Fawkner. There is also a memorial in the Old Melbourne Cemetery.\nMelbourne was called Batmania for a very brief time, in 1835, after John Batman.\nHe was also one of the first Australians to take part in the Common wealth Games 1823.\nHis direct descendant is Australian sprinter Daniel Batman.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":50},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":133},{"uri":"Parramatta","surface_form":"Parramatta","offset":173},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":193},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":220},{"uri":"Van_Diemen%27s_Land","surface_form":"Van Diemen's Land","offset":242},{"uri":"Black_Line","surface_form":"conflicts with the Tasmanian Aborigines","offset":385},{"uri":"Bushranger","surface_form":"bushranger","offset":489},{"uri":"Matthew_Brady","surface_form":"Matthew Brady","offset":520},{"uri":"Westernport%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Westernport","offset":572},{"uri":"Victoria_(state)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":592},{"uri":"Port_Phillip_Association","surface_form":"Port Phillip Association","offset":675},{"uri":"Schooner","surface_form":"schooner","offset":747},{"uri":"Schooner_Rebecca","surface_form":"Rebecca","offset":757},{"uri":"Port_Phillip","surface_form":"Port Phillip Bay","offset":787},{"uri":"Batman%27s_Treaty","surface_form":"Batman's Treaty","offset":844},{"uri":"Wurundjeri","surface_form":"Wurundjeri","offset":975},{"uri":"Convict","surface_form":"convict","offset":1243},{"uri":"Yarra_River","surface_form":"Yarra River","offset":1335},{"uri":"Fawkner_Cemetery","surface_form":"Fawkner Cemetery","offset":1482},{"uri":"John_Pascoe_Fawkner","surface_form":"John Pascoe Fawkner","offset":1543},{"uri":"Old_Melbourne_Cemetery","surface_form":"Old Melbourne Cemetery","offset":1596},{"uri":"Daniel_Batman","surface_form":"Daniel Batman","offset":1833}]}
