{"id":542780,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathe","text":"A lathe is a type of machine used to shape things. Various kinds of work such as woodturning, metalworking, metal spinning, spin welding and glassworking use lathes. A lathe works by turning an object on an axis and applying a tool to shape it. Most lathes turn the workpiece on a horizontal axis; the potter's wheel uses a vertical axis. There are various types of lathe machine but horizontal lathes are used widely.\nCNC (Computer numerical control) lathes can perform the same jobs more accurately than manual lathes. Lathes work by using accessories such as cutting tools and rests.\nExamples of objects that can be made using a lathe are, candlestick holders, gun barrels, cue sticks and baseball bats.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Woodturning","surface_form":"woodturning","offset":81},{"uri":"Metalworking","surface_form":"metalworking","offset":94},{"uri":"Metalspinning","surface_form":"metal spinning","offset":108},{"uri":"Spin_welding","surface_form":"spin welding","offset":124},{"uri":"Glassworking","surface_form":"glassworking","offset":141},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":281},{"uri":"Potter%27s_wheel","surface_form":"potter's wheel","offset":302},{"uri":"Numerical_control","surface_form":"numerical control","offset":433},{"uri":"Gun_barrel","surface_form":"gun barrels","offset":664},{"uri":"Cue_stick","surface_form":"cue sticks","offset":677},{"uri":"Baseball_bat","surface_form":"baseball bats","offset":692}]}
