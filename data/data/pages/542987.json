{"id":542987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goofy_and_Wilbur","text":"\"Goofy and Wilbur\" is an animated cartoon short. It was made by Walt Disney Productions. It was released by RKO Radio Pictures on March 17, 1939. It was the first cartoon with Goofy in a solo role without either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.\nIn this cartoon Goofy goes fishing with his pet grasshopper, Wilbur. They have nothing but bad luck. The smarter dog, Goofy, and his dumb insect friend catch fish in a fishing net using Wilbur as bait. This cartoon shows a lot of violence, because Wilbur is nearly, or perhaps actually, killed.\nThe cartoon is known for its 13 slapstick adventures during the eight minutes of action. It was released two years after \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937) and a year before \"Pinocchio\" and \"Fantasia\" (both in 1940).\nPlot.\nGoofy and his friend Wilbur, a tame grasshopper, team up for a fishing expedition. Goofy decides to use Wilber as bait, but he realizes too late that his friend might actually get eaten by a fish. Goofy has a boat he is rowing and a net, but no fishing rod. Wilbur, being a live bug, becomes the perfect choice for bait inside their fishing net, which will attract the fish as food.\nWilber's life depends on Goofy to save the little bug, who becomes the bait for a half-dozen fish. As Wilber gets tricked again and again, he is at last swallowed by a frog; then that frog gets eaten by a stork, all while Goofy desperately attempts a chasing rescue. In the end Wilbur hatches out of the stork egg, and to Goofy's relief, seems okay. It is not explained how Wilber ended up in the egg of the stork. One blog writer says: \"I wonder if Goofy has had a psychotic break at the end of the cartoon, and the reappearance of Wilbur is simply a delusion.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":25},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":34},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios","surface_form":"Walt Disney Productions","offset":64},{"uri":"RKO_Pictures","surface_form":"RKO Radio Pictures","offset":108},{"uri":"Goofy","surface_form":"Goofy","offset":176},{"uri":"Mickey_Mouse","surface_form":"Mickey Mouse","offset":212},{"uri":"Donald_Duck","surface_form":"Donald Duck","offset":228},{"uri":"Pet","surface_form":"pet","offset":285},{"uri":"Grasshopper","surface_form":"grasshopper","offset":289},{"uri":"Dumb","surface_form":"dumb","offset":374},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":379},{"uri":"Fishing_net","surface_form":"fishing net","offset":409},{"uri":"Bait","surface_form":"bait","offset":437},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":471},{"uri":"Slapstick","surface_form":"slapstick","offset":568},{"uri":"Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_movie)","surface_form":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","offset":658},{"uri":"Pinocchio_(1940_movie)","surface_form":"Pinocchio","offset":717},{"uri":"Fantasia_(movie)","surface_form":"Fantasia","offset":733},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":836},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":974},{"uri":"Rowing","surface_form":"rowing","offset":985},{"uri":"Fishing_rod","surface_form":"fishing rod","offset":1010},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":1316},{"uri":"Stork","surface_form":"stork","offset":1353}]}
