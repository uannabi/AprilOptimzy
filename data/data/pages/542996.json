{"id":542996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_National_League","text":"e=\"preserve\">The National League is a league for Association football teams in England (though some teams come from Wales). It is the fifth highest division of Football in England. The league is made up of professional and non professional clubs.\nHistory.\nThe league was created in 1979 from the Northern Premier League and the Southern League. In 1987, teams began to be promoted to Football League Two, and since 2003, a second team was also promoted. The league was renamed from the Conference National to the National League in 2015. Vanarama also announced their sponsorship the same year, so the league became the Vanarama National League.\nIn 2004, two divisions were created below the main league, known as the National League North and National League South. In 2006, the league expanded from 22 to 24 teams.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"Association football","offset":49},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":79},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":116},{"uri":"Football_in_England","surface_form":"Football in England","offset":160},{"uri":"Northern_Premier_League","surface_form":"Northern Premier League","offset":296},{"uri":"Southern_League","surface_form":"Southern League","offset":328},{"uri":"Football_League_Two","surface_form":"Football League Two","offset":384},{"uri":"National_League_North","surface_form":"National League North","offset":718},{"uri":"National_League_South","surface_form":"National League South","offset":744}]}
