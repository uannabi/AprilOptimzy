The products of such a reaction are a salt and water.\nThe reaction can be simplified to\nThe other ions remain constant because they are not affected by the reaction. They are called spectator ions.\nAcids and carbonates.\nAn acid can also react with a carbonate, which is a relatively weak base. An example is\nThe products of an acid-carbonate reaction is a soluble salt, carbon dioxide and water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":40},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":69},{"uri":"Base","surface_form":"base","offset":80},{"uri":"Spectator_ion","surface_form":"spectator ion","offset":268},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":374}]}
