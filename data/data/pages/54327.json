{"id":54327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_England","text":"South West England is one of the regions of England. It has the largest area of all regions, and reaches from Gloucestershire and Wiltshire to Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. This includes the area often known as the West Country, and much of Wessex. The size of the region is shown by the fact that the northern part of Gloucestershire, near Chipping Campden, is as close to the Scottish border as it is to the tip of Cornwall.\nAgriculture and tourism are the important industries of the region. Mining of tin and copper was also formerly very important in Devon and Cornwall. Traditionally, the South West of England has been well known for producing Cheddar cheese, named after Cheddar, Somerset in the Mendip Hills, for Devon cream teas, and for Somerset cider. It is now probably equally well known as the home of the \"Eden Project\" (in Cornwall), \"Aardman Animations\", the \"Glastonbury festival\" (in Somerset), \"trip hop\" music, Cornwall's seafood restaurants, and surfing beaches. Two National Parks (Dartmoor and Exmoor) and four World Heritage Sites lie in this region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Regions_of_England","surface_form":"regions of England","offset":33},{"uri":"Gloucestershire","surface_form":"Gloucestershire","offset":110},{"uri":"Wiltshire","surface_form":"Wiltshire","offset":130},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":143},{"uri":"Isles_of_Scilly","surface_form":"Isles of Scilly","offset":160},{"uri":"Wessex","surface_form":"Wessex","offset":245},{"uri":"Chipping_Campden","surface_form":"Chipping Campden","offset":345},{"uri":"Cheddar_cheese","surface_form":"Cheddar cheese","offset":655},{"uri":"Cheddar%2C_Somerset","surface_form":"Cheddar, Somerset","offset":683},{"uri":"Devon","surface_form":"Devon","offset":726},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":752},{"uri":"Cider","surface_form":"cider","offset":761},{"uri":"Surfing","surface_form":"surfing","offset":973},{"uri":"National_Parks_of_England_and_Wales","surface_form":"National Parks","offset":994},{"uri":"List_of_UNESCO_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"World Heritage Sites","offset":1040}]}
