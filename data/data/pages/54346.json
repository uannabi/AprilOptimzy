{"id":54346,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight","text":"In boxing, the term heavyweight is used for a specific group of people based on weight. A heavyweight is a boxer who weighs more than 201 lbs. At 201 pounds 91\u00A0kg and below is cruiserweight. Boxing organizations created many divisions so that fighters could fight people of the same size but mostly because more champions are created thus more profit. Most divisions only separate each other by few lbs.\nThe first heavyweight champion under modern rules was John L. Sullivan. Famous heavyweight champions have included Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Vitali Klitshko, Tyson Fury and Lennox Lewis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Boxing","surface_form":"boxing","offset":3},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":80},{"uri":"Pound_(mass)","surface_form":"lbs","offset":138},{"uri":"Cruiserweight","surface_form":"cruiserweight","offset":176},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":198},{"uri":"John_L._Sullivan","surface_form":"John L.
