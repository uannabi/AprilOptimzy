{"id":543586,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caupolic%C3%A1n","text":"Caupolic\u00E1n was a leader of the Mapuche people of Chile, who decided to choose a supreme war leader in response to the Spanish threat. Caupolican supposedly won the position by demonstrating his superior strength by holding up a tree trunk three days and three nights, though this may be an exaggeration.\nIn addition to proving his physical power, he also had to improvise a poetical speech to inspire the people to valor and unity. Much of the legend of Caupolican is found in the epic poem La Araucana by Alonso de Ercilla, a major piece of literature about the Spanish conquest of America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mapuche","surface_form":"Mapuche","offset":31},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":49},{"uri":"La_Araucana","surface_form":"La Araucana","offset":491},{"uri":"Alonso_de_Ercilla","surface_form":"Alonso de Ercilla","offset":506}]}
