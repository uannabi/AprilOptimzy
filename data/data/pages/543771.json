{"id":543771,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_definite_composition","text":"=\"preserve\">The\u00A0law of definite proportions (or Proust's law) states that a\u00A0chemical compound\u00A0always has exactly the same proportion of\u00A0elements\u00A0by mass.\nAmounting to the same thing is the\u00A0law of constant composition. This states that all samples of a given chemical compound have the same elemental composition by mass. For example,\u00A0oxygen\u00A0makes up about\u00A08/9\u00A0of the mass of any sample of pure\u00A0water, while\u00A0hydrogen\u00A0makes up the remaining\u00A01/9\u00A0of the mass. The law of definite proportions is the basis of\u00A0stoichiometry, together with the\u00A0law of multiple proportions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":76},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"elements","offset":136},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":148},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":334},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":394},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":407},{"uri":"Stoichiometry","surface_form":"stoichiometry","offset":504},{"uri":"Law_of_multiple_proportions","surface_form":"law of multiple proportions","offset":537}]}
