It was named after Queen Victoria, the Queen of the United Kingdom.\nIn 1857, the British government expanded Victoria City and divided it into seven districts, including Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Tai Ping Shan and Central. These were located in the area that is now the Central, Western and Wanchai districts.\nVictoria City is technically the capital of Hong Kong. However, the name is rarely used today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":56},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":84},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":92},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":127},{"uri":"British_Monarchy","surface_form":"Queen of the United Kingdom","offset":147},{"uri":"Sai_Ying_Pun","surface_form":"Sai Ying Pun","offset":278},{"uri":"Sheung_Wan","surface_form":"Sheung Wan","offset":292},{"uri":"Tai_Ping_Shan","surface_form":"Tai Ping Shan","offset":304}]}
