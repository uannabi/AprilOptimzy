{"id":544052,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail","text":"The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th century transportation route through central North America. It connected Independence, Missouri with Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell. The Santa Fe Trail was a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to Santa Fe in 1880. Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro which carried trade from Mexico City.\nThe route skirted the northern edge and crossed the northwestern corner of Comancheria, the territory of the Comanches. they demanded payment for allowing people to use the trail. Comanche raiding farther south in Mexico isolated New Mexico. This made the area more dependent on the American trade. It also gave the Comanches a steady supply of horses. By the 1840s trail traffic along the Arkansas River valley was so heavy that bison herds could not reach important seasonal grazing land. This contributed to their decline which in turn hastened the decline of Comanche power in the region. The Trail was used as the 1846 U.S. invasion route of New Mexico during the Mexican\u2013American War.\nAfter the U.S. took the Southwest ending the Mexican\u2013American War, the trail helped open the region new settlement. It was important for the expansion of the U.S. into the lands it had taken.\nHistoric trail.\nThe road route is commemorated today by the National Park Service as the Santa Fe National Historic Trail. A highway route that roughly follows the trail's path through the entire length of Kansas, the southeast corner of Colorado and northern New Mexico has been designated as the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway. It is long and takes about 12 hours to drive the trail today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":25},{"uri":"Transportation","surface_form":"transportation","offset":38},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":75},{"uri":"Independence%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Independence, Missouri","offset":103},{"uri":"Santa_Fe%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Santa Fe, New Mexico","offset":131},{"uri":"William_Becknell","surface_form":"William Becknell","offset":181},{"uri":"Highway","surface_form":"highway","offset":241},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":279},{"uri":"El_Camino_Real_de_Tierra_Adentro","surface_form":"El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro","offset":342},{"uri":"Mexico_City","surface_form":"Mexico City","offset":400},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":435},{"uri":"Northwestern","surface_form":"northwestern","offset":465},{"uri":"Comancheria","surface_form":"Comancheria","offset":488},{"uri":"Comanche","surface_form":"Comanche","offset":522},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":618},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":627},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":696},{"uri":"Arkansas_River","surface_form":"Arkansas River","offset":803},{"uri":"Bison","surface_form":"bison","offset":843},{"uri":"Grazing","surface_form":"grazing","offset":890},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":1042},{"uri":"Mexican%E2%80%93American_War","surface_form":"Mexican\u2013American War","offset":1082},{"uri":"Southwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Southwest","offset":1128},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":1197},{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":1208},{"uri":"Expansion","surface_form":"expansion","offset":1245},{"uri":"National_Park_Service","surface_form":"National Park Service","offset":1356},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":1502},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":1534},{"uri":"National_Scenic_Byway","surface_form":"National Scenic Byway","offset":1609}]}
