{"id":54414,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Shadow of the Colossus\" is a Japanese-made action-adventure video game made and sold by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEI) for the PlayStation 2. The game was sold in North America and Japan in October 2005, and was then sold in Europe and Oceania in February 2006. The game was made by SCEI's International Production Studio 1, the same video game makers that made the game Ico.\nThe game is about a person called Wander, a young man who must travel across a large area on a horse and destroy sixteen giant creatures called the colossi to bring back the life of a dead girl. The game is not a normal action-adventure type of game because there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters to talk to, and no enemies to destroy other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus has been described as a puzzle game, because each colossus has a weakness which must be found and somehow used to defeat the colossi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":43},{"uri":"Action","surface_form":"action-adventure","offset":57},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":74},{"uri":"Sony","surface_form":"Sony Computer Entertainment","offset":102},{"uri":"PlayStation_2","surface_form":"PlayStation 2","offset":145},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":181},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":208},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":216},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":243},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":254},{"uri":"February","surface_form":"February","offset":265},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":274},{"uri":"Ico","surface_form":"Ico","offset":389},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":489},{"uri":"Puzzle_game","surface_form":"puzzle game","offset":818}]}
