Formerly the name of the administrative units was \"Amt\". Most of the functions of municipal government for several villages are consolidated and administered centrally from a larger or more central village among the group, while the individual villages (Ortsgemeinden) still maintain a limited degree of local autonomy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":99},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"Bundeslands","offset":106},{"uri":"Rhineland-Palatinate","surface_form":"Rhineland-Palatinate","offset":138},{"uri":"Saxony-Anhalt","surface_form":"Saxony-Anhalt","offset":176}]}
