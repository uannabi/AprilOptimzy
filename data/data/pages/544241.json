{"id":544241,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist","text":"An agonist is a type of chemical known as a ligand. It binds to a receptor. It activates (switches on) the receptor to produce a response.\nAn agonist causes an action. There are also antagonists which block the action of the agonists, and there are inverse agonists which cause an action opposite to that of the agonist.\nThis is typical of the systems which regulate the body. Being able to control activity is the basis of homeostasis.\nTypes of agonists.\nReceptors can be activated by either endogenous or exogenous agonists. Both types result in a biological response. Endogenous agonists include hormones and neurotransmitters. Exogenous agonists include drugs.\nA substance which causes the same bodily responses, but does \"not\" bind to the same receptor is called a physiological agonist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ligand","surface_form":"ligand","offset":44},{"uri":"Receptor_(cell_biology)","surface_form":"receptor","offset":66},{"uri":"Receptor_antagonist","surface_form":"antagonist","offset":183},{"uri":"Inverse_agonist","surface_form":"inverse agonist","offset":249},{"uri":"Regulate","surface_form":"regulate","offset":358},{"uri":"Control","surface_form":"control","offset":391},{"uri":"Homeostasis","surface_form":"homeostasis","offset":424},{"uri":"Receptor_(cell_biology)","surface_form":"Receptors","offset":456},{"uri":"Endogenous","surface_form":"endogenous","offset":493},{"uri":"Exogenous","surface_form":"exogenous","offset":507},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":599},{"uri":"Neurotransmitter","surface_form":"neurotransmitter","offset":612},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"drugs","offset":658},{"uri":"Physiological","surface_form":"physiological","offset":770}]}
