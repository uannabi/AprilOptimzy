It is the county seat of Howard County. Fayette is part of the Columbia, Missouri Metropolitan statistical area.\nHistory.\nFayette was made county seat in 1823. It was named for Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, who at the time was soon expected to pay a visit to the United States from France. It was incorporated in 1855.\nThe original Town of Fayette was first settled by Hiram Fugate and Hickerson Burnham. Each one gave 25 s of land for the location of the county seat. The town was surveyed and laid out in 1823 by Judge Alfred W. Morrison. He later became the sheriff and county judge. The original town layout formed a rectangle, about three blocks wide and seven blocks long with a public \"square\" in the center. It was divided into 150 s, with numbering beginning at the southeast corner of the square.\nThe four major streets bordered the square originally were named \"First Main\" (east side), \"Second Main\" (west side), \"First Main Cross\" (south side) and \"Second Main Cross\" (north side). In 1900, because of the confusion, the street names were changed to \"Main\", \"Church\", \"Morrison\", and \"Davis\", respectively.\nIt should be noted that the Fayette Square configuration is an example of the \"Shelbyville Square\", so called from its prototype in Shelbyville, Tennessee. This plan included a central courthouse and used the block of the grid plan to lay out the streets. The Shelbyville plan and other central courthouse plans were widely adopted in Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri. \"The Shelbyville Square quickly became the most frequent county seat plan in new counties in most states.\" The Shelbyville pattern became less popular 1900.\nGeography.\nFayette is located at (39.145468, -92.686126).
