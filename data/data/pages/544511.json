{"id":544511,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%26Carrot","text":"\"Pepper&Carrot\" is an open source webcomic series. Its author is the French artist David Revoy. The series consists of small episodes about teenage witch Pepper and her cat Carrot. The comic is translated into more than 28 different languages. The stories do not contain violence. That's because Revoy wants \"Pepper&Carrot\" to be accessible for everyone.\nRevoy says he makes the series only with free software, such as Krita and Inkscape. You can download Krita source files for every image.\nLicense.\nAnyone can use the images. They are available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. Revoy says he likes fanart and other works based on \"Pepper&Carrot\".\nList of episodes.\nRevoy aims to draw one episode every month.\nFunding.\nRevoy wants to change the comic book industry by removing intermediate steps in the production process. \"Pepper&Carrot\" is free, but Revoy lets people support him on the Patreon crowdfunding platform. You can sign up to give a small amount of money per episode that he makes. Patreon takes 5% of the money. The credit card companies take another part. This is still less than a traditional comic production, where the publisher, distributors and retailers want money.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Open_source","surface_form":"open source","offset":22},{"uri":"Webcomic","surface_form":"webcomic","offset":34},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":69},{"uri":"David_Revoy","surface_form":"David Revoy","offset":83},{"uri":"Adolescence","surface_form":"teenage","offset":140},{"uri":"Witchcraft","surface_form":"witch","offset":148},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":169},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free software","offset":396},{"uri":"Krita","surface_form":"Krita","offset":419},{"uri":"Inkscape","surface_form":"Inkscape","offset":429},{"uri":"Creative_Commons_licenses","surface_form":"Creative Commons","offset":557},{"uri":"Patreon","surface_form":"Patreon","offset":909},{"uri":"Crowdfunding","surface_form":"crowdfunding","offset":917},{"uri":"Publisher","surface_form":"publisher","offset":1157},{"uri":"Retail","surface_form":"retail","offset":1185}]}
