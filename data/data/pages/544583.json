{"id":544583,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March","text":"=\"preserve\">The Salt March was part of the Indian independence movement. It was a non-violent protest against the salt tax by British government. The Indians were upset that the government increased the price of salt.\nMahatma Gandhi led the march. It started on March 12, 1930. It went from sabarmati Ashram to the village of Dandi. Marchers took a handful of salt from the shore. They then announced that they had broken the law by making salt. This was a major but peaceful challenge against Britain colony. This move enraged the British and called for his arrest.\nThe British then came to the beach and beat Gandhi and anyone with him, but the Indians didn't fight back. They stood there, to prove their point.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mahatma_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mahatma Gandhi","offset":218}]}
