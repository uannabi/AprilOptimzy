{"id":544610,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplast","text":"Protoplast in modern biology, is what is left of a cell when the cell wall is dissolved. That leaves the cell's nucleus and the surrounding protoplasmic materials.\nDefinition: a protoplast is a plant, bacterial or fungal cell that had its cell wall completely or partially removed using either mechanical or enzymatic means.\nBecause cell walls are made differently in the different kingdoms, different enzymes are used to remove them.\nEnzymes for the preparation of protoplasts.\nThe reason for removing the cell walls is to allow many different experimental techniques to be used.\nProtoplasts are widely used for DNA transformation (for making genetically modified organisms), since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of DNA into the cell. In the case of plant cells, protoplasts can be regenerated into whole plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":21},{"uri":"Cell_nucleus","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":112},{"uri":"Protoplasm","surface_form":"protoplasm","offset":140},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":194},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":201},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungal","offset":214},{"uri":"Cell_wall","surface_form":"cell wall","offset":239},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzymatic","offset":308},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdoms","offset":382},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":613},{"uri":"Transformation_(genetics)","surface_form":"transformation","offset":617},{"uri":"Genetically_modified_organism","surface_form":"genetically modified organism","offset":644}]}
