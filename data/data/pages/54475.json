Heresy is to reject or doubt the beliefs of the Church after having been baptised. Schism means that the opposing parties have a disagreement within the establishment. Both groups have to accept that they are in schism. In the canon law of the Catholic Church, an act of schism, apostasy or heresy brings the penalty of excommunication.\nUse within Islam.\nThere are divisions between Sunni, Shia, and Kharijite Islam in CE 632 regarding the rightful successor to the prophet Muhammad. In 661 and 680 there were divisions regarding the rightful claimant to the Caliphate.\nUse within Buddhism.\nIn Buddhism, the first schism was set up by Devadatta, during Buddha's life. After Buddha's passing away, the early Buddhist schools developed various schisms. In the old texts, 18 or 20 early schools are mentioned. Later, there were the Mahayana and Vajrayana movements, which can be regarded as being schismatic in origin. There are now perhaps thousands of different Buddhist sects.\nUse within Judaism.\nThroughout the Jewish history, Judaism survived many schisms. Today, major Jewish denominations are Orthodox Judaism and non-Orthodox: Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":53},{"uri":"History_of_Christianity","surface_form":"history of Christianity","offset":548},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":601},{"uri":"Heresy","surface_form":"heresy","offset":679},{"uri":"Baptism","surface_form":"baptised","offset":760},{"uri":"Canon_law","surface_form":"canon law","offset":914},{"uri":"Apostasy","surface_form":"apostasy","offset":966},{"uri":"Heresy","surface_form":"heresy","offset":978},{"uri":"Excommunication","surface_form":"excommunication","offset":1007},{"uri":"Sunni","surface_form":"Sunni","offset":1070},{"uri":"Shi%27a_Islam","surface_form":"Shia","offset":1077},{"uri":"Kharijite","surface_form":"Kharijite","offset":1087},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":1097},{"uri":"Common_Era","surface_form":"CE","offset":1106},{"uri":"632","surface_form":"632","offset":1109},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":1161},{"uri":"661","surface_form":"661","offset":1174},{"uri":"680","surface_form":"680","offset":1182},{"uri":"Caliph","surface_form":"Caliph","offset":1246},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":1281},{"uri":"Devadatta","surface_form":"Devadatta","offset":1322},{"uri":"Gautama_Buddha","surface_form":"Buddha","offset":1340},{"uri":"Early_Buddhist_schools","surface_form":"early Buddhist schools","offset":1388},{"uri":"Mahayana","surface_form":"Mahayana","offset":1516},{"uri":"Vajrayana","surface_form":"Vajrayana","offset":1529},{"uri":"Sect","surface_form":"sect","offset":1657},{"uri":"Jewish_history","surface_form":"Jewish history","offset":1699},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":1715},{"uri":"Jewish_denominations","surface_form":"Jewish denominations","offset":1759},{"uri":"Orthodox_Judaism","surface_form":"Orthodox Judaism","offset":1784},{"uri":"Reform_Judaism","surface_form":"Reform","offset":1819},{"uri":"Conservative_Judaism","surface_form":"Conservative","offset":1827},{"uri":"Reconstructionist_Judaism","surface_form":"Reconstructionist","offset":1844}]}
