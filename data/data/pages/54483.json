{"id":54483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodoxy","text":"Oriental Orthodoxy means the group of Eastern Christian Churches that accept only the first three ecumenical councils \u2014 the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople and the Council of Ephesus \u2014 and do not accept the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon. These Churches are also called Old Oriental Churches. Oriental Orthodox churches are different from the churches that call themselves Eastern Orthodoxy.\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the spiritual leader of the Oriental Orthodox Churches. This is because the Pope of Alexandria is also Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy See of St. Mark the Apostle.\nThe spiritual leadership is not understood in the same sense as among the Eastern Orthodox Churches to the Church of Constantinople. It is in the spirit of respect and honour for the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. It does not give any special rights to the Church of Alexandria.\nHistory.\nThe schism (division) between \"Great Church Orthodox and Catholic\" and the \"Oriental Orthodox Churches\" happened in the 5th century after the Council of Chalcedon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eastern_Christianity","surface_form":"Eastern Christian","offset":38},{"uri":"Accept","surface_form":"accept","offset":70},{"uri":"Ecumenical_council","surface_form":"ecumenical council","offset":98},{"uri":"First_Council_of_Nicaea","surface_form":"First Council of Nicaea","offset":124},{"uri":"First_Council_of_Constantinople","surface_form":"First Council of Constantinople","offset":153},{"uri":"Council_of_Ephesus","surface_form":"Council of Ephesus","offset":193},{"uri":"Dogma","surface_form":"dogmatic definitions","offset":236},{"uri":"Council_of_Chalcedon","surface_form":"Council of Chalcedon","offset":264},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodoxy","offset":420},{"uri":"Coptic_Orthodox_Church_of_Alexandria","surface_form":"Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria","offset":443},{"uri":"Schism_(religion)","surface_form":"schism (division)","offset":944},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":984},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":997},{"uri":"5th_century","surface_form":"5th century","offset":1060}]}
