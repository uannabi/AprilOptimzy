{"id":544838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking_(computing)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Handshaking is the connection between the computer and a device. Handshaking is required in order to allow both the computer and device to send protocols to each other. During a handshake, the two devices make sure that they know certain connection requirements of each other. For instance, they will need to find out a suitable bit rate and latency for each other.\nExamples of devices that use this method include a modem or another computer. Normally, handshaking happens between two devices. Although, a TCP three-way handshake is a special type of handshake that involves sending a connection from one computer to another, just done three times.\nTCP three-way handshake.\nIn this setup, a synchronize message will request a server to make a connection with each other, while the acknowledgement messages return to the requesting server to let it know the message was received. Letting both hosts send synchronize messages to each other will allow the two hosts to connect with each other in both directions. Each acknowledgement message sent to each other ensures they are still connected with each other.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Connection","surface_form":"connection","offset":32},{"uri":"Protocol","surface_form":"protocol","offset":157},{"uri":"Bit_rate","surface_form":"bit rate","offset":342},{"uri":"Latency","surface_form":"latency","offset":355},{"uri":"Device_driver","surface_form":"devices","offset":391},{"uri":"Method_(computer_science)","surface_form":"method","offset":413},{"uri":"Modem","surface_form":"modem","offset":430}]}
