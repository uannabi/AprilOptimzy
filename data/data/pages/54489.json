{"id":54489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma","text":"A dogma is something that should not be disputed or doubted. Most often, this means the basic beliefs and doctrines of a religion. What a majority of followers of an ideology or any kind of organization believe in can also be a dogma.\nIn the context of religion, the term has a neutral meaning. Outside of religion for most people the term means something negative, because it accepts only a particular point of view. If someone disputes a religious dogma, they can be accused of heresy.\nIn Christianity, the Resurrection of Jesus is a basic dogma.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dispute","surface_form":"disputed","offset":40},{"uri":"Doubt","surface_form":"doubted","offset":52},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":94},{"uri":"Doctrine","surface_form":"doctrine","offset":106},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":121},{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideology","offset":166},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":190},{"uri":"Context","surface_form":"context","offset":242},{"uri":"Neutral","surface_form":"neutral","offset":278},{"uri":"Point_of_view","surface_form":"point of view","offset":403},{"uri":"Heresy","surface_form":"heresy","offset":480},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":491},{"uri":"Resurrection","surface_form":"Resurrection","offset":509},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":525}]}
