{"id":54525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Generation","text":"\"Love Generation\" () was a dramatic Japanese television series on Fuji Television. It first aired in Japan from October 13 1997 to December 22, 1997 every Monday. It had a very high rating of 30.8%. It features music by Cagnet.\nSummary.\nThe show revolves around the relationship of the two leading characters, Katagiri Teppei and Uesugi Riko, who begin their relationship as squabbling colleagues before falling in love. Katagiri Teppei is a talented designer and very popular among women. Unfortunately, Teppei, who despises anything boring and repetitive, is forced to move to the sales department for his egocentric behavior. Throughout the series, he is forced to adapt to the new working environment, which includes cutting his precious locks of hair to create a neater and more professional image. As he struggles to adapt, he meets Uesugi Riko. While she does not like him at first, she eventually falls for him. However, Teppei runs into his highschool sweetheart Mizuhara Sanae, and discovers that his ex-girlfriend is now engaged to his brother Soichiro. Fortunately, Riko is there to console him, and this eventually blooms into a romance. Not long after, however, Sanae realizes she still has feelings for Teppei, and thus creates a love triangle. To make the matter even more complicated, Soichiro starts to have an affair with his past girlfriend.\nCrystal apple.\nTeppei's apartment has many unusual items such as Thai artifact, a 30-year-old refrigerator, and a crystal apple. The meaning behind the apple is that there is only one true love, between Adam and Eve, that is. A crystal can be broken easily, and when one would look in it, it appears upside down. The apple is seen upside down for the 10 of the 11 episodes. At the last episode, however, the apple is no longer upside down. The apple is on the album cover of the soundtrack for \"Love Generation\".\nTrue love never runs smooth.\nThe advertising poster appears over and over again. The model is holding a crystal apple, and reads \"True love never runs smooth\" symbolizing the relationship between Riko and Teppei, which constantly faces struggles from when they meet for the very first time to the love triangle. This advertisement is visible everywhere from the park to Teppei's 30-year-old refrigerator, as \"True love never runs smooth\" is the unofficial tagline of this television series.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":27},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":36},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":45},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":101},{"uri":"October_13","surface_form":"October 13","offset":112},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":123},{"uri":"December_22","surface_form":"December 22","offset":131},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":144},{"uri":"Cagnet","surface_form":"Cagnet","offset":220},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thai","offset":1427},{"uri":"Adam_and_Eve","surface_form":"Adam and Eve","offset":1565},{"uri":"Advertisement","surface_form":"advertising poster","offset":1908},{"uri":"Model_(person)","surface_form":"model","offset":1960},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":1979},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":1987},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":2050},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":2172},{"uri":"Refrigerator","surface_form":"refrigerator","offset":2266},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":2347}]}
