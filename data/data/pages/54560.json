{"id":54560,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugworm","text":"The lugworm (\"Arenicola marina\"), also known as the sandworm, is a large marine worm of the phylum Annelida. Lugworms make the coiled tubes of sand that are a familiar sight on a beach at low tide. The lugworm itself is not seen except by people who dig them up from curiosity or to use as fishing bait.\nThe lugworm lives in a U-shaped tube in the sand, and filters out its food from the water.\nArenicola marina can grow to about 5 inches long (13 cm). Its body is segmented, like that of an earthworm. It has bristles in the middle of its body. It is a polychaete. It also has well-developed blood-vessels, and gills to breathe in the water.\nAlthough the textbook example is usually \"Arenicola marina\", there is a second species, \"Arenicola defodiens\", which lives a similar life. It grows to about 9 inches long (23 cm)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":73},{"uri":"Phylum_(biology)","surface_form":"phylum","offset":92},{"uri":"Annelida","surface_form":"Annelida","offset":99},{"uri":"Filter_feeder","surface_form":"filters","offset":358},{"uri":"Segmented","surface_form":"segmented","offset":465},{"uri":"Earthworm","surface_form":"earthworm","offset":492},{"uri":"Polychaeta","surface_form":"polychaete","offset":554},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":593},{"uri":"Gill","surface_form":"gill","offset":612}]}
