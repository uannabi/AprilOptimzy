{"id":54563,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitta_succinea","text":"\"Alitta succinea\", also known as the pile worm or clam worm, is a common polychaete worm.\nIt is a species of ragworm or sandworm. The terms can refer to any one of a number of other species.\nThis worm can reach up to 15 centimeters (6\u00A0inches) in length. Most specimens are smaller than this. It is brown coloured at the rear, and reddish-brown on the rest of its body. It has a head with four eyes, two sensory feelers or palps, and eight tentacles. It is a freeswimming polychaete, scavenging on the bottom of shallow marine waters.\nClam worms are an important food source for bottom-feeding fish and crustaceans. They can protect themselves by secreting a mucous substance which hardens to form a sheath around them.\nPlanktonic larvae develop, grow into adults and eventually sink to the bottom of the water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polychaete","surface_form":"polychaete","offset":73},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":98},{"uri":"Ragworm","surface_form":"ragworm","offset":109},{"uri":"Sandworm","surface_form":"sandworm","offset":120},{"uri":"Pedipalp","surface_form":"palp","offset":422},{"uri":"Polychaete","surface_form":"polychaete","offset":471},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":602},{"uri":"Mucous","surface_form":"mucous","offset":658},{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"Plankton","offset":719}]}
