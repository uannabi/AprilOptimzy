{"id":5460,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"For the aircraft, see P-47 Thunderbolt and A-10 Thunderbolt II.\"\nThunder is a very loud sound that is made sometimes during a very big rain storm.\nThunder is so loud, it can be heard from a very far distance.\nIt can sound like a boom, a crash, or a rumble.\nThunder is made when lightning strikes.\nThe energy from the lightning heats up the air so much that it makes a kind of explosion.\nWhen lightning is very near, thunder will be heard soon after the lightning flash, and the sound will be very loud. If the lightning is farther away, the thunder will be a few seconds or many seconds after the lightning. People can guess how far away the lightning is by counting the number of seconds between the time they see the lightning and hear the thunder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":23},{"uri":"P-47_Thunderbolt","surface_form":"P-47 Thunderbolt","offset":37},{"uri":"A-10_Thunderbolt_II","surface_form":"A-10 Thunderbolt II","offset":58},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":150},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":155},{"uri":"Boom","surface_form":"boom","offset":244},{"uri":"Lightning","surface_form":"lightning","offset":293},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":316},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":578}]}
