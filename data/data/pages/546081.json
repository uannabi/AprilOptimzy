{"id":546081,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking","text":"Mountain biking is the sport of riding bicycles off-road. Often this is done over rough terrain. Mountain biking uses specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes are similar to other bikes, but have features designed to make them stronger and hold up in rough terrain.\nMountain biking can generally be broken down into multiple categories. These include cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as \"Enduro\"), downhill, freeride and dirt jumping. However, the majority of mountain biking falls into the categories of trail and cross country riding styles.\nThis individual sport requires the rider to have endurance, core strength and balance. The rider also needs bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders take on steep technical descents and high incline climbs. Mountain biking can be performed almost anywhere from a back yard to a gravel road, but the majority of mountain bikers ride off-road trails. Using the bike's brakes must be done carefully on a mountain bike, especially when going downhill. In order to work on rough terrain, mountain bikes have several gears from which to choose. It is recommended to use safety gear such as helmet, gloves, elbow and knee pads to avoid injuries in rough terrain. Mountain biking should be done so as to enjoy the ride but not damage the environment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":39},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":52},{"uri":"Mountain_bikes","surface_form":"mountain bikes","offset":137},{"uri":"Bike","surface_form":"bike","offset":189},{"uri":"Feature","surface_form":"feature","offset":205},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":266},{"uri":"Cross-country_cycling","surface_form":"cross country","offset":360},{"uri":"Enduro_(mountain_biking)","surface_form":"all mountain","offset":389},{"uri":"Downhill_cycling","surface_form":"downhill","offset":434},{"uri":"Freeride","surface_form":"freeride","offset":444},{"uri":"Dirt_jumping","surface_form":"dirt jumping","offset":457},{"uri":"Trail","surface_form":"trail","offset":541},{"uri":"Endurance","surface_form":"endurance","offset":629},{"uri":"Core","surface_form":"core","offset":640},{"uri":"Strength","surface_form":"strength","offset":645},{"uri":"Balance","surface_form":"balance","offset":658},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"skill","offset":702},{"uri":"Self-reliance","surface_form":"self-reliance","offset":714},{"uri":"Advanced","surface_form":"Advanced","offset":729},{"uri":"Technical","surface_form":"technical","offset":759},{"uri":"Descent","surface_form":"descent","offset":769},{"uri":"Incline","surface_form":"incline","offset":787},{"uri":"Climb","surface_form":"climb","offset":795},{"uri":"Brake","surface_form":"brake","offset":962},{"uri":"Gear","surface_form":"gear","offset":1107},{"uri":"Helmet","surface_form":"helmet","offset":1180},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injuries","offset":1225},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":1326}]}
