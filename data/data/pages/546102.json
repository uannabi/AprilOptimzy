{"id":546102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch%2C_yaw%2C_and_roll","text":"Pitch, yaw and roll are the three dimensions of movement when an object moves through a medium.\nThe terms may be used to describe an aeroplane's movements through the air. They are also applied to fish moving through water, and spacecraft moving through space.\nThere are in fact six degrees of freedom of a rigid body moving in three-dimensional space.\nAs the movement along each of the three axes is independent of each other and independent of the rotation about any of these axes, the motion has six degrees of freedom (see diagram).\nThe surfaces of a plane and the fins of a fish have a similar function. They serve to adjust the object's attitude as it moves through the fluid. Submarines face the same dynamic control problems as fish do.\nThe subject is often taught under degrees of freedom (mechanics). This is the number of independent motions that are allowed to the body.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aeroplane","surface_form":"aeroplane","offset":133},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":197},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":228},{"uri":"Submarines","surface_form":"Submarines","offset":683},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanics","offset":799}]}
