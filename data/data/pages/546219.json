The name \"Brexit\" is a portmanteau (merging two words together) of \"British\" and \"exit\".\nOn 23 June 2016, the UK made a referendum that asked whether the UK should leave the EU. The result was that 51.9% of the UK electorate (the main region of the UK) voted that the UK should leave the EU. The rest wanted the UK to stay in the EU. On 29 March 2017, the UK government said that they will definitely be leaving the EU. This started the procedure of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, a law that deals with countries that leave the EU. The UK was expected to fully leave the EU on 29 March 2019 at 11p.m. UTC. The deadline to leave was later changed to 31 October 2019.\nOn 15 January 2019, Theresa May's government was defeated in the House of Commons by 230 votes in a vote on her deal to leave the European Union.\nOn 24 December 2020, a post-Brexit trade deal was finally made.\nTimeline.\nBelow is a timeline of major events relating to Brexit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":47},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":77},{"uri":"Portmanteau","surface_form":"portmanteau","offset":121},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum%2C_2016","surface_form":"referendum that asked whether the UK should leave the EU","offset":218},{"uri":"Government_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK government","offset":454},{"uri":"Treaty_on_European_Union","surface_form":"Treaty on European Union","offset":566},{"uri":"UTC","surface_form":"UTC","offset":712},{"uri":"Theresa_May","surface_form":"Theresa May","offset":797},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":842}]}
