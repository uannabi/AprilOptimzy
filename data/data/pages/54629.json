{"id":54629,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas","text":"Biogas can be used as a vehicle fuel or to generate electricity. It can also be burned directly for cooking, heating, lighting, process heat and absorption refrigeration.\nBiogas and anaerobic digestion.\nAnaerobic digestion is much used to make biogas from biodegradable waste because valuable fuel can be produced while destroying disease-causing pathogens and reducing the volume of disposed waste products. The methane in bio gas burns more cleanly than coal, and produces more energy with less emissions of carbon dioxide. The harvesting of bio gas is an important role of waste management because methane is a greenhouse gas with a greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide. The carbon in bio gas was generally recently extracted from the atmosphere by photosynthetic plants, so releasing it back into the atmosphere adds less total atmospheric carbon than the burning of fossil fuels.\nBiogas typical composition range.\nThe composition of biogas varies depending on how it is made. Landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around 50%. Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 55-75%CH4.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":32},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":347},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":456},{"uri":"Emission","surface_form":"emission","offset":497},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":510},{"uri":"Waste_management","surface_form":"waste management","offset":576},{"uri":"Greenhouse_gas","surface_form":"greenhouse gas","offset":614},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":644},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthetic","offset":768},{"uri":"Fossil_fuels","surface_form":"fossil fuels","offset":887}]}
