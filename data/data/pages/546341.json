The non-binding resolution, which was supported by 100 United Nations member states, affirmed the General Assembly's commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and underscored the invalidity of the 2014 Crimean referendum. Eleven (11) nations voted against the resolution, while 58 abstained, and a further 24 states were absent when the vote took place.\nThe resolution was introduced by Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine. The adoption of the resolution was preceded by the unsuccessful attempts of the United Nations Security Council, that convened seven sessions to address the Crimean crisis, only to face Russian veto.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","surface_form":"United Nations General Assembly","offset":128},{"uri":"Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation","surface_form":"Russian annexation of Crimea","offset":179},{"uri":"Members_of_the_United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations member states","offset":312},{"uri":"Territorial_integrity","surface_form":"territorial integrity","offset":392},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":417},{"uri":"2014_Crimean_referendum","surface_form":"2014 Crimean referendum","offset":509},{"uri":"United_Nations_Security_Council","surface_form":"United Nations Security Council","offset":839},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":945},{"uri":"United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power","surface_form":"veto","offset":953}]}
