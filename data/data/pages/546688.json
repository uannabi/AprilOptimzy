{"id":546688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouillabaisse","text":"Bouillabaisse is a French fisherman's soup. This traditional Proven\u00E7al fish stew originated in the port of Marseille. The word is a compound of \"bolhir\" (to boil) and \"abaissar\" (to reduce heat, i.e., simmer).\nIt was a stew made by Marseille fishermen using the bony rockfish they were unable to sell. As well as fish, the soup has mussels (fr: \"moules\") and may have other marine invertebrates. Vegetables such as leeks, onions, tomatoes, celery, and potatoes are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish.\nThe broth is traditionally served with a rouille, a mayonnaise made of olive oil, garlic, saffron, and cayenne pepper on grilled slices of bread.\nIn Marseille, the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and \"rouille\", then the fish is served separately on a large platter (see image). A simpler version has the fish and broth brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French","offset":19},{"uri":"Fisherman","surface_form":"fisherman","offset":26},{"uri":"Soup","surface_form":"soup","offset":38},{"uri":"Provence","surface_form":"Proven\u00E7al","offset":61},{"uri":"Stew","surface_form":"stew","offset":76},{"uri":"Marseille","surface_form":"Marseille","offset":107},{"uri":"Boiling","surface_form":"boil","offset":157},{"uri":"Simmer","surface_form":"simmer","offset":201},{"uri":"Stew","surface_form":"stew","offset":219},{"uri":"Rockfish","surface_form":"rockfish","offset":267},{"uri":"Mussels","surface_form":"mussels","offset":332},{"uri":"Invertebrates","surface_form":"invertebrates","offset":381},{"uri":"Leek","surface_form":"leek","offset":415},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":422},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":430},{"uri":"Celery","surface_form":"celery","offset":440},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":452},{"uri":"Rouille","surface_form":"rouille","offset":565},{"uri":"Mayonnaise","surface_form":"mayonnaise","offset":576},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"olive oil","offset":595},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":606},{"uri":"Saffron","surface_form":"saffron","offset":614},{"uri":"Cayenne_pepper","surface_form":"cayenne pepper","offset":627}]}
