{"id":546895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myco-heterotrophy","text":"Myco-heterotrophy is a relationship between certain plants and fungi. The plant gets all or part of its food from parasitism on fungi, not from photosynthesis.\nIn the past, non-photosynthetic plants were thought to get food by breaking down organic matter like fungi do. Such plants were therefore called \"saprophytes\". That was wrong. It is now known that \"no plant is physiologically capable of direct breakdown of organic matter\".\nTo get food, non-photosynthetic plants engage in parasitism, by myco-heterotrophy or direct parasitism of other plants.\nThe interface between the plant and fungal partners in this association is between the roots of the plant and the mycelium of the fungus. Myco-heterotrophy therefore closely resembles mycorrhiza, and is thought to have evolved from mycorrhiza.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plants","surface_form":"plants","offset":52},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":63},{"uri":"Parasitism","surface_form":"parasitism","offset":114},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":144},{"uri":"Organic_matter","surface_form":"organic matter","offset":241},{"uri":"Saprotroph","surface_form":"saprophytes","offset":306},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiologically","offset":370},{"uri":"Mycelium","surface_form":"mycelium","offset":668},{"uri":"Mycorrhiza","surface_form":"mycorrhiza","offset":738}]}
