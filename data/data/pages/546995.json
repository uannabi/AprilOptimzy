In 2007 she received the International Women of Courage Award.\nIn 2002, Trimarco's daughter, Maria de los Angeles Veron (\"Marita\"), disappeared. She was kidnapped by human traffickers. Trimarco went to brothels to look for her daughter. She said she wanted to buy women. She did not find Marita, but she found 129 other women and got their freedom.\nTrimarco saved many women. Some of them stayed at her house. Finally there were so many women she could not take care of them, so she started the Fundacion Maria de los Angeles, named for her daughter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"San_Miguel_de_Tucum%C3%A1n","surface_form":"San Miguel de Tucum\u00E1n","offset":81},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentinian","offset":110},{"uri":"International_Women_of_Courage_Award","surface_form":"International Women of Courage Award","offset":155},{"uri":"Kidnapping","surface_form":"kidnapped","offset":283},{"uri":"Human_trafficking","surface_form":"human traffickers","offset":296},{"uri":"Brothel","surface_form":"brothel","offset":332},{"uri":"Fundacion_Maria_de_los_Angeles","surface_form":"Fundacion Maria de los Angeles","offset":625}]}
