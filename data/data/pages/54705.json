{"id":54705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopoda","text":"Octopods are the order which contains the common octopus and some other types. Fossila are rare, but they do have a fossil record starting in the later Carboniferous.\nOctopods are put into two suborders. One, the Incirrina, is composed of the well-known \"Octopus\" of rocky shores and coral reefs and its relatives. The other suborder, the Cirrina, contains octopods whose tentacles are linked by an umbrella-like mantle, so their activity is rather different from the common octopus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":17},{"uri":"Octopus","surface_form":"octopus","offset":49},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":152},{"uri":"Incirrina","surface_form":"Incirrina","offset":213},{"uri":"Octopus","surface_form":"Octopus","offset":255},{"uri":"Shore","surface_form":"shore","offset":273},{"uri":"Coral_reefs","surface_form":"coral reefs","offset":284},{"uri":"Cirrina","surface_form":"Cirrina","offset":339}]}
