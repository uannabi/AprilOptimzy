He was born in Tehran.\nHabib has many hit songs such as \u201CMarde Tanhaye Shab\u201D, \u201CShahla\u201D, and \u201CMadar\u201D. The song \u201CShahla\u201D was inspired after listening to an Azeri performer. However, there is a common misconception that Shahla has been inspired by Habib\u2019s ex-wife (the name of his ex-wife is Shaadi and not Shahla).\nHabib died on June 10, 2016 in Ramsar, Mazandaran, Iran, from a heart attack, aged 68.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":85},{"uri":"Tehran","surface_form":"Tehran","offset":127},{"uri":"Azari_Language","surface_form":"Azeri","offset":266},{"uri":"Ramsar%2C_Mazandaran","surface_form":"Ramsar, Mazandaran","offset":456},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":489}]}
