{"id":547313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ing%C3%B3lfr_Arnarson","text":"Ing\u00F3lfr Arnarson () and his wife, Hallveig Frodesdatter, are commonly said to be the first permanent Nordic settlers of Iceland. According to tradition, they founded Reykjav\u00EDk in 874.\nAccording to the Landn\u00E1mab\u00F3k (a book which describes the settlement of Iceland by the Norsemen), he built his house in modern-day Reykjav\u00EDk and named the city as well. Medieval historian Ari \u00DEorgilsson claimed that Arnarson was the first Nordic settler in Iceland, but Irish monks and hermits lived there before he arrived. He also claimed that the they left because they did not want to live with the newly arrived Norse pagans.\nThe Landn\u00E1mab\u00F3k claims that Arnarson left modern-day Norway after becoming involved in a blood feud. He had heard about an island that Gar\u00F0ar Svavarsson, Fl\u00F3ki Vilger\u00F0arson and others found while sailing in the Atlantic ocean. With his step-brother, Hj\u00F6rleifr Hr\u00F3\u00F0marsson, he sailed for Iceland. When land was in sight, he threw his high seat pillars overboard and promised to settle where the gods decided to bring them ashore. Two of his slaves then searched the coasts for three years before finding the pillars in the small bay which eventually became Reykjav\u00EDk.\nMeanwhile, Hj\u00F6rleifr Hr\u00F3\u00F0marsson was murdered by his Irish slaves because of how badly he was treating-them. Ing\u00F3lfr hunted them down and killed them in Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands). The islands got their name from that event, but vestmenn (west men) is a name that the Norsemen at this time sometimes used for Irishmen. He continued to live in southwestern Iceland, but nothing is known about what happened to him after settling. His son, Torstein (\"\u00DEorsteinn Ing\u00F3lfsson\"), was said to have founded the first parliament, in Iceland. It later became known as the Althing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nordic_countries","surface_form":"Nordic","offset":101},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":120},{"uri":"Reykjav%C3%ADk","surface_form":"Reykjav\u00EDk","offset":166},{"uri":"Landn%C3%A1mab%C3%B3k","surface_form":"Landn\u00E1mab\u00F3k","offset":201},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":453},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monks","offset":459},{"uri":"Hermit","surface_form":"hermits","offset":469},{"uri":"Norse_religion","surface_form":"Norse pagans","offset":600},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":667},{"uri":"Feud","surface_form":"blood feud","offset":703},{"uri":"Gar%C3%B0ar_Svavarsson","surface_form":"Gar\u00F0ar Svavarsson","offset":749},{"uri":"Fl%C3%B3ki_Vilger%C3%B0arson","surface_form":"Fl\u00F3ki Vilger\u00F0arson","offset":768},{"uri":"Atlantic_ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic ocean","offset":825},{"uri":"Hj%C3%B6rleifr_Hr%C3%B3%C3%B0marsson","surface_form":"Hj\u00F6rleifr Hr\u00F3\u00F0marsson","offset":864},{"uri":"Vestmannaeyjar","surface_form":"Vestmannaeyjar","offset":1334},{"uri":"Norsemen","surface_form":"Norsemen","offset":1455},{"uri":"Althing","surface_form":"Althing","offset":1748}]}
