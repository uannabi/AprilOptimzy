{"id":547462,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Rabassa","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gregory Rabassa (March 9, 1922 \u2013 June 13, 2016) was an American literary translator from Spanish and Portuguese to English. He taught for many years at Columbia University and Queens College.\nHe worked primarily out of Spanish and Portuguese. He made English-language versions of the works of several major Latin American novelists, including Julio Cort\u00E1zar, Jorge Amado and Gabriel Garc\u00EDa M\u00E1rquez. On the advice of Cort\u00E1zar, Garc\u00EDa M\u00E1rquez waited three years for Rabassa to schedule translating \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\". He later declared Rabassa's translation to be better to the Spanish original.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":68},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literary","offset":77},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translator","offset":86},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":102},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":114},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":128},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":165},{"uri":"Queens_College","surface_form":"Queens College","offset":189},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":232},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":244},{"uri":"English-language","surface_form":"English-language","offset":264},{"uri":"Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar","surface_form":"Julio Cort\u00E1zar","offset":356},{"uri":"Jorge_Amado","surface_form":"Jorge Amado","offset":372},{"uri":"Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez","surface_form":"Gabriel Garc\u00EDa M\u00E1rquez","offset":388},{"uri":"One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude","surface_form":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","offset":510}]}
