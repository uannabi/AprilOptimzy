Decorations received by police and fire brigade personnel may sometimes be considered alongside military decorations, on which they may be modelled, although they are strictly not military awards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medal","surface_form":"medal","offset":45},{"uri":"Civil_decoration","surface_form":"Civil decoration","offset":171},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":341},{"uri":"Fire_brigade","surface_form":"fire brigade","offset":352}]}
