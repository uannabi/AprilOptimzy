{"id":547476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_cancer","text":"=\"preserve\">Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus.\nThe symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue.\nThe treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Malignant","surface_form":"malignant","offset":46},{"uri":"Human_gastrointestinal_tract","surface_form":"gastrointestinal tract","offset":74},{"uri":"Accessory_organs_of_digestion","surface_form":"accessory organs of digestion","offset":112},{"uri":"Esophagus","surface_form":"esophagus","offset":157},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":168},{"uri":"Biliary_system","surface_form":"biliary system","offset":177},{"uri":"Pancreas","surface_form":"pancreas","offset":193},{"uri":"Small_intestine","surface_form":"small intestine","offset":203},{"uri":"Large_intestine","surface_form":"large intestine","offset":220},{"uri":"Rectum","surface_form":"rectum","offset":237},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":248},{"uri":"Endoscopy","surface_form":"endoscopy","offset":451},{"uri":"Biopsy","surface_form":"biopsy","offset":474}]}
