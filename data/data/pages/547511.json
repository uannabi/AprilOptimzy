{"id":547511,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrift_Shop_(song)","text":"\"Thrift shop\" is a song by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. It was released on August 27, 2012. This song is Macklemore's eighth career single and the fourth single from their album\u00A0\"The Heist\". The song has vocals from\u00A0Wanz. The song was written to show Macklemore's esteem for\u00A0thrift shops\u00A0and saving money. The lyrics go against the displaying of expensive items many rappers do. Music reviewers liked the song for its funny lyrics and social critique. It was released in the United Kingdom in January 2013.\nCritical reception.\nThe song received extensive critical recognition. It has been called a critique of the advertising\u00A0common in modern\u00A0hip hop. However, \"The New York Times\"\u00A0critic Jon Caramanica says, \"it's not quite the robust sendup of hip-hop-extravagance clich\u00E9s that it aspires to be.\" Robert Copsey from\u00A0Digital Spy\u00A0rated the song 5 out of 5 stars, calling it \"a rare beast of a song - original, musically daring and genuinely funny.\"\nPerformance.\nIn the United States, the song got onto the\u00A0\"Billboard\"\u00A0Hot 100\u00A0on September 15, 2012. It dropped out the next week but entered again six weeks later on October 20, 2012. The song then rose the chart until it entered the top ten on January 5, 2013. It replaced Bruno Mars' \"Locked Out of Heaven\" at number one in its 16th week. It remained at the top for six weeks in total. It has also topped the\u00A0Rap Songs\u00A0chart for fifteen weeks. It's the first song in the history of the Digital Songs chart to jump in sales in each of its first five weeks at the top of the chart. \"Thrift Shop\" sold 6,148,000 copies in 2013. This made it the second best-selling single of 2013 in the US after\u00A0Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\". As of November 2015, the song has sold 7,740,000 downloads in the United States. This makes it the fifth all-time best-selling digital single in the country.\nThe song was also successful on\u00A0\"Billboard\"'s component charts. It was at the top of the\u00A0Digital Songs\u00A0chart for ten weeks. It\u00A0was also at the top of \"Billboard\"<nowiki/>'s\u00A0Radio Songs<nowiki/>chart for two weeks. It reached number one on the On-Demand Songs\u00A0chart and stayed there for eleven weeks until March 30, 2013. It set a record on that chart as the first song to reach two million streams in a single week. The song also topped the\u00A0R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\u00A0chart for fourteen weeks straight. It is also only the second independent song to get the number one spot on the\u00A0\"Billboard\"\u00A0Hot 100 chart, nearly 20 years after\u00A0Lisa Loeb's \"Stay (I Missed You)\" in 1994.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Thrift Shop\" entered at number twenty four on the\u00A0UK Singles Chart. However, it was available as a single via\u00A0iTunes\u00A0since August 1, 2012. The next week, the single rose twenty-two positions to number two. Two weeks after entering the chart, the song rose one place to a peak of number one on February 10, 2013. This made Macklemore and Ryan Lewis only the second act to get a number one in Britain with a self-released single. As of July 2013, \"Thrift Shop\" has sold 680,000 copies in the UK.\nMusic video.\nThe music video for the song was co-directed by\u00A0Jon Jon Augustavo, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. It was released on Lewis' YouTube channel on August 29, 2012. It was filmed at several thrift shops in\u00A0Seattle. Macklemore tried to get rapper\u00A0Sir Mix-a-Lot\u00A0in the video but he did not return the calls. Some local Seattle musicians like Thomas Grey of Champagne Champagne are in the music video. The video was nominated at the\u00A02013 MTV Video Music Awards\u00A0for\u00A0Video of the Year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Macklemore_and_Ryan_Lewis","surface_form":"Macklemore and Ryan Lewis","offset":27},{"uri":"The_Heist_(album)","surface_form":"The Heist","offset":177},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":641},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":660},{"uri":"Digital_Spy","surface_form":"Digital Spy","offset":817},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\"\u00A0Hot 100","offset":1005},{"uri":"Robin_Thicke","surface_form":"Robin Thicke","offset":1643},{"uri":"Blurred_Lines","surface_form":"Blurred Lines","offset":1659},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"\"Billboard\"","offset":1865},{"uri":"Hot_100_Airplay","surface_form":"Radio Songs","offset":2006},{"uri":"Lisa_Loeb","surface_form":"Lisa Loeb","offset":2454},{"uri":"Stay_(I_Missed_You)","surface_form":"Stay (I Missed You)","offset":2467},{"uri":"UK_Singles_Chart","surface_form":"UK Singles Chart","offset":2571},{"uri":"ITunes","surface_form":"iTunes","offset":2631},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":3225}]}
