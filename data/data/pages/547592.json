{"id":547592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) is an informal international group of botanists who came together to get a consensus on the taxonomy of flowering plants (angiosperms). They wanted to base it on plant relationships got from phylogeny.\nFour versions of a classification system have come from this collaboration. They were published in 1998, 2003, 2009 and 2016. Earlier angiosperm classifications were not based on monophyletic groups (i.e., groups that include all the descendants of a common ancestor).\nPrinciples of the APG system.\nFor a detailed discussion on phylogenetic nomenclature, see Cantino \"et al\" 2007.\nThe latest version is APG IV.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botanists","offset":88},{"uri":"Consensus","surface_form":"consensus","offset":125},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":142},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":154},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"phylogeny","offset":241},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":431}]}
