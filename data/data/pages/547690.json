The campaign names twenty women who are imprisoned unjustly. Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, started the campaign for the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration.\nThe reason for the campaign was to tell governments to stop putting women in prison, and to tell the women and their families that they are not alone. There were twenty names of women in twenty days, one for every year since the Beijing Declaration.\nIn September 2015, a bipartisan \"#FreeThe20\" bill was introduced to the U.S Senate. All twenty women senators of the two political parties supported the bill. They said,\nNames of the women.\nFor status of the women updated to the end of the Powers' term as Secretary of State, see [https://www.humanrights.gov/freethe20/ #FreeThe20 Women Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Concern Campaign].","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"campaign","offset":15},{"uri":"Prisoner","surface_form":"prisoner","offset":69},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"unjustly","offset":148},{"uri":"Samantha_Power","surface_form":"Samantha Power","offset":158},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"Ambassador","offset":183},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":201},{"uri":"Anniversary","surface_form":"anniversary","offset":256},{"uri":"Beijing_Declaration","surface_form":"Beijing Declaration","offset":275},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"U.S Senate","offset":618}]}
