The International Braille Chess Association originated unofficially in 1951 with the organization of the first international correspondence chess tournament for blind players, by\u00A0Reginald Walter Bonham; the tournament included 20 players representing 10 countries. It first organized a tournament in 1958, with representatives from seven countries. Today, it has grown to encompass over 50 member nations around the world.[1]\u00A0The IBCA hosts two important competitions: the\u00A0Blind Chess Olympiad\u00A0and the\u00A0Blind World Chess Championship.\nRule modifications.\nAfter making every move, each player is required to announce their move aloud to their opponent. Instead of writing the moves on a chess score sheet, the visually impaired player writes the moves in\u00A0Braille\u00A0or records the moves on a\u00A0tape recorder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blind","offset":87},{"uri":"Visual_impairment","surface_form":"visually impaired","offset":97},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":115},{"uri":"Reginald_Walter_Bonham","surface_form":"Reginald Walter Bonham","offset":309},{"uri":"Blind_Chess_Olympiad","surface_form":"Blind Chess Olympiad","offset":603},{"uri":"Score_sheet_(chess)","surface_form":"chess score sheet","offset":815},{"uri":"Braille","surface_form":"Braille","offset":883},{"uri":"Tape_recorder","surface_form":"tape recorder","offset":917}]}
