{"id":54797,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Xenophobia is the fear or dislike of strangers or unknown things. Xenophobia can also mean the fear of trying new things, but it is usually the fear of differences between people. Xenophobia may be about foreign things or people, or just the attitudes of a group towards other groups. It may increase because of immigration. Apparently, xenophobia has always existed. Even the Ancient Greeks believed that barbarians (non-Greeks) were naturally meant to be enslaved.\nSometimes xenophobia overlaps with other types of phobias such as Islamophobia, Germanophobia or Anti-Mexican sentiment.\nThe Vienna Declaration by United Nations declares that all people should have equal human rights and toleration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":325},{"uri":"Ancient_Greeks","surface_form":"Ancient Greeks","offset":390},{"uri":"Barbarians","surface_form":"barbarians","offset":419},{"uri":"Islamophobia","surface_form":"Islamophobia","offset":546},{"uri":"Anti-German_sentiment","surface_form":"Germanophobia","offset":560},{"uri":"Anti-Mexican_sentiment","surface_form":"Anti-Mexican sentiment","offset":577},{"uri":"Vienna_Declaration","surface_form":"Vienna Declaration","offset":605},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":627},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":685},{"uri":"Toleration","surface_form":"toleration","offset":702}]}
