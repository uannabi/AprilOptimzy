{"id":548068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Milo_and_Otis","text":"e=\"preserve\"> is a 1986 Japanese-French adventure comedy-drama movie. It is about two animals, Milo (an orange tabby cat) and Otis (a pug). The original Japanese version, narrated by Shigeru Tsuyuki and with poetry recitation by Ky\u014Dko Koizumi, was released on June 27, 1986. Columbia Pictures removed 15 minutes from the original movie and released a shorter English-language version, narrated by Dudley Moore, on August 25, 1989.\nAt minute 46:25 of Milo and Otis footage, seagulls eat a kitten, showing a live terrified, running kitten eaten into flying blood flesh into the air of a cliff, which clearly evidences that the Japanese filmmaker in Japan and those related in the Japanese film industry refused to stop the attacking on the kitten running for its life. Everyone can see for oneself through free live streaming. There is no cover up or dead end in seeing it with one's own eyes. The bureaucracy and red tape claims bring into question excuse-making.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adventure_movie","surface_form":"adventure","offset":40},{"uri":"Comedy-drama_movie","surface_form":"comedy-drama movie","offset":50},{"uri":"Tabby_cat","surface_form":"tabby cat","offset":111},{"uri":"Pug","surface_form":"pug","offset":134},{"uri":"Ky%C5%8Dko_Koizumi","surface_form":"Ky\u014Dko Koizumi","offset":229},{"uri":"Dudley_Moore","surface_form":"Dudley Moore","offset":397}]}
