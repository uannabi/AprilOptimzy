{"id":548182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go","text":"\"Pok\u00E9mon Go\" (or \"Pok\u00E9mon GO\") is a free-to-play Android and iOS game. It was developed by Niantic. It is licensed by The Pokemon Company. It was released in July 2009 in the US, Europe, and Australia. The game lets players catch and train fictional living beings, called Pocket Monsters (in Japan) or Pok\u00E9mon (everywhere else). The game makes them exist in real life by using GPS and a smartphone's camera.\nAs players walk in the real world, their character in the game moves as well. Players can find Pokemon by using the game map to walk to places where the grass is moving. They can then throw a Pokeball at the Pokemon to see if they can catch it. Players can also walk to special places in the game called \"PokeStops\" or \"Gyms\". At PokeStops, players can find extra PokeBalls and candy to feed their Pokemon. At Gyms, players can get their pokemon to fight another pokemon to try to win that gym for their team.\nAn earlier game by Niantic called \"Ingress\" was used to make the special places in the game. Pokemon GO got its start in an April Fool's joke by Google and The Pokemon Company in 2013, called \"Pokemon Challenge\".\nAn item called Pokemon GO Plus is being sold to let people play the game without looking at their smartphones all the time. Pokemon GO looks like a Gameplay of Pok\u00E9mon mixed with the Google Maps pin shape.\n\"Pok\u00E9mon Go\" has a current score of 69 critic score and a user score of 5.5 on Metacritic.\nThe game became more popular after they released the Generation 2 Pok\u00E9mon, featuring more items and Pokemon. In that update, berries (a type of fruit that makes the Pok\u00E9mon flee, higher chance on catching, etc.) were added, and evolution items were added in (things that are used to evolve Pokemon to become one certain), such as the Metal Coat and Kings Rock.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Free-to-play","surface_form":"free-to-play","offset":36},{"uri":"Android_(operating_system)","surface_form":"Android","offset":49},{"uri":"IOS","surface_form":"iOS","offset":61},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":65},{"uri":"Niantic","surface_form":"Niantic","offset":91},{"uri":"The_Pokemon_Company","surface_form":"The Pokemon Company","offset":118},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":302},{"uri":"Global_Positioning_System","surface_form":"GPS","offset":377},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":387},{"uri":"Gameplay_of_Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Gameplay of Pok\u00E9mon","offset":1279},{"uri":"Google_Maps_pin","surface_form":"Google Maps pin","offset":1314},{"uri":"Metacritic","surface_form":"Metacritic","offset":1416},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":1494}]}
