The word has a long history, going back to the ancient Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato.\nIt was used in older psychology and philosophy as meaning the source or cause of human nature. It is not a scientific term, but the word \"psychology\" is derived from it. The English word soul was sometimes used synonymously in older texts.\nIn modern times the word is used as a synonym of mind.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":24},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"conscious","offset":30},{"uri":"Unconscious_mind","surface_form":"unconscious","offset":44},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":104},{"uri":"Philosophers","surface_form":"philosophers","offset":118},{"uri":"Heraclitus","surface_form":"Heraclitus","offset":139},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":154},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":182},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":197},{"uri":"Human_nature","surface_form":"human nature","offset":242},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"soul","offset":348},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":372},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonym","offset":439},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":450}]}
