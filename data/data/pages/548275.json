{"id":548275,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebird","text":"The bluebirds are a group of medium-sized, mostly insectivorous or omnivorous Passerine birds. They are in the genus \"Sialia\" of the thrush family (Turdidae).\nBluebirds are one of the few thrush genera in the Americas. They have blue, or blue and rose beige, plumage. Female birds are less brightly colored than males, although color patterns are similar and there is no noticeable difference in size between the two sexes.\nBluebirds are territorial and prefer open grassland with scattered trees. Predators of young bluebirds in the nests may include snakes, cats, and raccoons. Bird species competing with bluebirds for nesting locations include the common starling, American crow, and house sparrows. House sparrows take over the nesting sites of bluebirds, killing young, smashing eggs, and probably killing adult bluebirds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Insectivorous","surface_form":"insectivorous","offset":50},{"uri":"Passerine","surface_form":"Passerine","offset":78},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":88},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":111},{"uri":"Thrush_(bird)","surface_form":"thrush","offset":133},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":209},{"uri":"Plumage","surface_form":"plumage","offset":259},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":466},{"uri":"Predators","surface_form":"Predators","offset":498},{"uri":"Snakes","surface_form":"snakes","offset":552},{"uri":"Cats","surface_form":"cats","offset":560},{"uri":"Raccoon","surface_form":"raccoon","offset":570},{"uri":"Starling","surface_form":"starling","offset":659},{"uri":"Crow","surface_form":"crow","offset":678},{"uri":"House_sparrow","surface_form":"house sparrow","offset":688}]}
