{"id":548332,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpor","text":"e=\"preserve\">Torpor is a physiological state of the body. It occurs in some small warm-blooded animals when food is scarce.\nSome animals have periods of torpor every day. Tiny hummingbirds do.\nSo do some small mammals, for example, rodent species (such as mice), and bats. Many small marsupial also have daily periods of torpor.\nTorpor is a well controlled thermoregulatory process. It is not the result of switching off thermoregulation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physiological","surface_form":"physiological","offset":25},{"uri":"Warm-blooded","surface_form":"warm-blooded","offset":82},{"uri":"Hummingbirds","surface_form":"hummingbirds","offset":176},{"uri":"Mice","surface_form":"mice","offset":256},{"uri":"Bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":267},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":284},{"uri":"Thermoregulation","surface_form":"thermoregulatory","offset":357}]}
