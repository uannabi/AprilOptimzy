{"id":548496,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus","text":"e=\"preserve\">A thrombus, also called a blood clot, is the final product of the coagulation step in hemostasis. There are two parts to a thrombus: aggregated platelets and red blood cells that form a plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein.\nThe substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called cruor.\nA thrombus is a healthy response to injury to prevent bleeding, but can be harmful in thrombosis, when clots blocks blood flow through healthy blood vessels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coagulation","surface_form":"coagulation","offset":79},{"uri":"Hemostasis","surface_form":"hemostasis","offset":99},{"uri":"Platelets","surface_form":"platelets","offset":157},{"uri":"Red_blood_cell","surface_form":"red blood cell","offset":171},{"uri":"Fibrin","surface_form":"fibrin","offset":232},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injury","offset":346},{"uri":"Thrombosis","surface_form":"thrombosis","offset":396}]}
