{"id":548554,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(military)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In military terminology, a demonstration is an attack or show of force on a battlefield designed to trick or mislead an enemy. Unlike a feint, a demonstration does not make contact with the enemy. It is usually used as a supporting attack intended to deceive an enemy into thinking the demonstration is the main attack.\nAn example of a demonstration in the American Civil War was at the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 2, 1863, General Robert E. Lee ordered Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell to stage a demonstration against Culp's Hill on the Union right flank. This was in support of Lieutenant General James Longstreet's main attack against the Union left flank.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":16},{"uri":"Terminology","surface_form":"terminology","offset":25},{"uri":"Show_of_force","surface_form":"show of force","offset":70},{"uri":"Battlefield","surface_form":"battlefield","offset":89},{"uri":"Mislead","surface_form":"mislead","offset":122},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemy","offset":133},{"uri":"Feint","surface_form":"feint","offset":149},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":370},{"uri":"Battle_of_Gettysburg","surface_form":"Battle of Gettysburg","offset":400},{"uri":"Robert_E._Lee","surface_form":"Robert E.
