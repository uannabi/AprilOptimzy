He invented the concept and portmanteau word prequiem, which designates a musical composition to be rendered as its beneficiary lay dying.\nWoodard invented a fictional psychoactive machine called the Feraliminal Lycanthropizer. At the end of the 20th century he fabricated replicas of an actual psychoactive device called the Dreamachine.\nWoodard is also known for his work with Nueva Germania, a settlement in Paraguay. His German book of correspondence \"Five Years\", coauthored by Swiss novelist Christian Kracht, describes some of the humanitarian work performed there.\u200B","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Santa_Barbara%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Barbara, California","offset":53},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":86},{"uri":"Postmodernism","surface_form":"postmodern","offset":95},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":106},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":117},{"uri":"Descendant","surface_form":"descendant","offset":134},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invented","offset":180},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":193},{"uri":"Portmanteau_word","surface_form":"portmanteau word","offset":205},{"uri":"Musical_composition","surface_form":"musical composition","offset":251},{"uri":"Beneficiary","surface_form":"beneficiary","offset":293},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"lay dying","offset":305},{"uri":"Psychoactive","surface_form":"psychoactive","offset":345},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":423},{"uri":"Human_settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":574},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":588},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":602},{"uri":"Swiss","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":660},{"uri":"Humanitarianism","surface_form":"humanitarian work","offset":715}]}
