{"id":548909,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_end_justifies_the_means","text":"\"The end justifies the means\" is a phrase of Sergey Nechayev, the 19th century Russian revolutionary. It means that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of getting it is acceptable.\nThe idea is ancient, but it was not meant to justify unnecessary cruelty. It was part of a political philosophy called consequentialism. The basic idea is that a policy can be judged by its outcome. All modern versions of consequentialism have to deal with the limitations necessary to prevent tyrants abusing this idea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sergey_Nechayev","surface_form":"Sergey Nechayev","offset":45},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":79},{"uri":"Revolutionary","surface_form":"revolutionary","offset":87},{"uri":"Goal","surface_form":"goal","offset":121},{"uri":"Political_philosophy","surface_form":"political philosophy","offset":286},{"uri":"Consequentialism","surface_form":"consequentialism","offset":314},{"uri":"Tyrant","surface_form":"tyrant","offset":489}]}
