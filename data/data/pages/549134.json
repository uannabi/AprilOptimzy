{"id":549134,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llullaillaco","text":"Llullaillaco is a stratovolcano in the Andes range, in Argentina and Chile. It is the 7th highest mountain in the Andes.\nIt lies in the Puna de Atacama, a region of very high volcanic peaks on a high plateau within the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded ascent was on 1 December 1952, by Bi\u00F3n Gonz\u00E1lez and Juan Harseim, from Chile. They found archaeological evidence that people were at the top of Llullaillaco in the pre-Columbian period.\nDuring 1983\u20131985, American archaeologist Johan Reinhard directed three surveys of archaeological sites on the summit and slopes of the mountain.\nThe summit is the highest archaeological site in the world. The mummies of three Inca children were found on it in 1999. These were found by Johan Reinhard and Constanza Ceruti and their expedition. Other artifacts were also found along with the mummies. It is believed that the children were part of a human sacrifice.\nGeography.\nThe volcano is in the Chile-Argentina boder and is part, on the Chilean part, of the Llullaillaco National Park ().\nThe Llullaillaco is a stratovolcano. There were eruptions in 1854, 1866 and 1877. Since then, no volcanic activity has been recorded. It is the world\u00B4s second highest active volcano, second to \"Ojos del Salado\".\nIt is an ultra-prominent peak, or Ultra for short, because it has as a summit with a topographic prominence of or more.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stratovolcano","surface_form":"stratovolcano","offset":18},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":39},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"range","offset":45},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":55},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":69},{"uri":"List_of_mountains_in_the_Andes","surface_form":"7th highest mountain in the Andes","offset":86},{"uri":"Puna_de_Atacama","surface_form":"Puna de Atacama","offset":136},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":200},{"uri":"Atacama_Desert","surface_form":"Atacama Desert","offset":219},{"uri":"Driest","surface_form":"driest","offset":246},{"uri":"Pre-Columbian","surface_form":"pre-Columbian","offset":466},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":515},{"uri":"Survey","surface_form":"surveys","offset":559},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeological","offset":570},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":585},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summit","offset":598},{"uri":"Slope","surface_form":"slopes","offset":609},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summit","offset":637},{"uri":"Archaeological_site","surface_form":"archaeological site","offset":659},{"uri":"Mummies","surface_form":"mummies","offset":697},{"uri":"Inca","surface_form":"Inca","offset":714},{"uri":"Artifact_(archaeology)","surface_form":"artifacts","offset":838},{"uri":"Human_sacrifice","surface_form":"human sacrifice","offset":936},{"uri":"Llullaillaco_National_Park","surface_form":"Llullaillaco National Park","offset":1049},{"uri":"Stratovolcano","surface_form":"stratovolcano","offset":1102},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruptions","offset":1128},{"uri":"Ultra-prominent_peak","surface_form":"ultra-prominent peak","offset":1301},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summit","offset":1363},{"uri":"Topographic_prominence","surface_form":"topographic prominence","offset":1377}]}
