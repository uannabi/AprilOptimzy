The gallery is in an old building with three floors.\nIn 2007, art historian Olivier Meessen and art lover Jan De Clercq began to work to start a contemporary art gallery in Brussels. In April 2008 the gallery opened, with a group show of works by seven artists. After this first show, the gallery closed to rebuild it. From September 2008 the gallery re-opened with group and solo shows by both older and new artists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Contemporary_art","surface_form":"contemporary art","offset":36},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":64},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":74},{"uri":"Art_historian","surface_form":"art historian","offset":145},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":256}]}
