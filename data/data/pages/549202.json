{"id":549202,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_(geology)","text":"A chevron in geology is a sharply-folded rock formation. Chevron folds are regular folded beds with straight limbs and sharp hinges. Well developed, these folds produce a set of v-shaped beds.\nThey develop in response to compressive stress. The angles of the folds are generally 60 degrees or less. Chevron folding is helped if the bedding alternates between beds of different make-up. Turbidites, with alternating sandstones and shales, are the typical geological setting for chevron folds to occurs.\nChevrons can also form in land deposits, especially where there are sand dunes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":13},{"uri":"Rock_formation","surface_form":"rock formation","offset":41},{"uri":"Compression_(physical)","surface_form":"compressive","offset":221},{"uri":"Stress_(mechanics)","surface_form":"stress","offset":233},{"uri":"Fold_(geology)","surface_form":"folds","offset":259},{"uri":"Sandstone","surface_form":"sandstones","offset":415},{"uri":"Shale","surface_form":"shales","offset":430},{"uri":"Sand_dune","surface_form":"sand dune","offset":570}]}
