April 1926) was an Australian politician and possible murder victim.\nMcDonald studied at the University of Sydney. He became a teacher, and rose to become President of the Teachers Federation of New South Wales. In 1922 he stood for election to the Australian House of Representatives, and won the new seat of Barton for the Labor Party. His main opponent was Hector Lamond, who had been the Nationalist member for the abolished seat of Illawarra.\nDisappearance.\nIn the 1925 election, McDonald was narrowly defeated by Nationalist candidate Thomas Ley. McDonald took the result to court, claiming that Ley had tried to bribe him, asking him not to put in his nomination papers. However, on 15 April 1926 McDonald disappeared on his way to a meeting with New South Wales Premier Jack Lang. They were planning to have the election result declared void. Neither McDonald's body nor his brief case were ever found.\nThomas Ley was found guilty of murder in England, but it was decided he was insane. He was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, where he died. It is believed that Ley was responsible for McDonald's disappearance. He is also suspected of being involved in the suspicious deaths of other of his political opponents.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":55},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":66},{"uri":"University_of_Sydney","surface_form":"University of Sydney","offset":129},{"uri":"Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Australian House of Representatives","offset":285},{"uri":"Division_of_Barton","surface_form":"Barton","offset":346},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Labor Party","offset":361},{"uri":"Hector_Lamond","surface_form":"Hector Lamond","offset":396},{"uri":"Nationalist_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Nationalist","offset":428},{"uri":"Division_of_Illawarra","surface_form":"Illawarra","offset":473},{"uri":"Thomas_Ley","surface_form":"Thomas Ley","offset":577},{"uri":"Bribe","surface_form":"bribe","offset":655},{"uri":"New_South_Wales_Premier","surface_form":"New South Wales Premier","offset":790},{"uri":"Jack_Lang_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"Jack Lang","offset":814},{"uri":"Insane","surface_form":"insane","offset":1023},{"uri":"Broadmoor_Hospital","surface_form":"Broadmoor Hospital","offset":1046}]}
