{"id":54936,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire","text":"The Mongol Empire, an area ruled by the great Mongol Khans in the 13th and 14th centuries, was one of the largest land empires in history.\nThe original homeland of the Mongols, was bounded by the Khingan Mountains on the east, the Altai and Tian mountains on the west, the Shilka River and the mountain ranges by Lake Baikal on the north, and the Great Wall of China on the south.\nIt was founded by Genghis Khan in 1206 AD when he brought together the Mongol and Turkic tribes. When he died in 1227 AD, he had conquered Central Asia, North China and parts of eastern Persia. Later his grandson Kublai Khan would go on to expand the empire and found the Mongol-ruled Yuan Dynasty, ruling whole China. The Mongol Empire stretched from Eastern Europe to Western Asia, including Central Asia and the Middle East. Its power did not last long, though. By the 1360s it had broken into several empires, all of which were later destroyed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongol","offset":46},{"uri":"Khan_(title)","surface_form":"Khans","offset":53},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":119},{"uri":"Lake_Baikal","surface_form":"Lake Baikal","offset":313},{"uri":"Great_Wall_of_China","surface_form":"Great Wall of China","offset":347},{"uri":"Genghis_Khan","surface_form":"Genghis Khan","offset":399},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":420},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":470},{"uri":"Kublai_Khan","surface_form":"Kublai Khan","offset":594},{"uri":"Yuan_Dynasty","surface_form":"Yuan Dynasty","offset":666},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":693}]}
