{"id":549468,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Metonic cycle is a period of about 19 years used in astronomy and calendar studies. In particular, it is often used in the structure of lunisolar calendars, because 19 solar years is almost exactly the same length of time as 235 lunar months.\nHistory.\nThe Metonic cycle is named for the astronomer Meton of Athens, who used the cycle in the calendar of Attica in the 5th century BCE. But it was used in the calendar of many ancient cultures, including Babylonia and China, before then.\nMetonic cycle and eclipses.\nA Metonic cycle is close to the length of 20 eclipse years. For that reason, some eclipses repeat for a time at 19-year intervals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":69},{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":83},{"uri":"Lunisolar_calendar","surface_form":"lunisolar calendar","offset":153},{"uri":"The_Sun","surface_form":"solar","offset":185},{"uri":"The_Moon","surface_form":"lunar","offset":246},{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":252},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":304},{"uri":"Meton_of_Athens","surface_form":"Meton of Athens","offset":315},{"uri":"Classical_Athens","surface_form":"Attica","offset":370},{"uri":"BCE","surface_form":"BCE","offset":396},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":441},{"uri":"Babylonia","surface_form":"Babylonia","offset":469},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"eclipse years","offset":576},{"uri":"Eclipse","surface_form":"eclipse","offset":613},{"uri":"Interval","surface_form":"interval","offset":651}]}
