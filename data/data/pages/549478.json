Haider was killed on February 15, 2013. More than 100,000 people attended his funeral in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.\nHaider organized protests against war criminals from the 1971 war. He also spoke against the fundamentalist Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami.\nThe protests started on February 5, and continued for 12 days. A group of bloggers stated the protests. They protested against a verdict by the special war tribunal that sent Abdul Quader Mollah, a Jamaat leader, to prison. Mollah was convicted of murder, rape and torture. The protesters wanted the death sentence.\nIn December 2015, two students were sentenced to death for killing Haider. Police said the students got their ideas from Jashim Uddin Rahmani, the leader of a mosque in Dhaka, who said it was legal to kill bloggers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":89},{"uri":"Blog","surface_form":"blog","offset":103},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":116},{"uri":"Funeral","surface_form":"funeral","offset":206},{"uri":"Dhaka","surface_form":"Dhaka","offset":217},{"uri":"War_criminal","surface_form":"war criminal","offset":285},{"uri":"Religious_fundamentalism","surface_form":"fundamentalist","offset":344},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":359},{"uri":"Bangladesh_Jamaat-e-Islami","surface_form":"Jamaat-e-Islami","offset":384},{"uri":"Verdict","surface_form":"verdict","offset":530},{"uri":"Tribunal","surface_form":"tribunal","offset":557},{"uri":"Convicted","surface_form":"convicted","offset":636},{"uri":"Death_sentence","surface_form":"death sentence","offset":701},{"uri":"Death_sentence","surface_form":"sentenced to death","offset":753}]}
