It is situated on the north bank of the Rappahannock River at the falls. The community is north of and opposite the city of Fredericksburg. Recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), Falmouth's population was 4,274 as of the 2010 census.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1728 by the same act of the Virginia Assembly that established neighboring Fredericksburg, Falmouth was created as a port town on the Rappahannock. It served the inhabitants living north of the river within the vast Northern Neck holdings of Lord Fairfax. His agent, Robert \"King\" Carter, promoted the establishment of the town. The Carter family played a dominant role in the town's growth throughout much of the colonial period. Originally located within King George County, Falmouth became part of Stafford County when county lines were redrawn in 1776.\nDuring the American Civil War, Falmouth was occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Northern commanders located their headquarters southeast of the town during the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns.\nToday Falmouth is a residential community and a suburb of Fredericksburg. Among the community's significant historic structures is Belmont, the home of American artist Gari Melchers, now a historic house museum administered by the University of Mary Washington. Chatham Manor, the 1771 home of William Fitzhugh and a Union headquarters during the Civil War, is located downstream from Falmouth, opposite the historic district of Fredericksburg. It is administered by the National Park Service as part of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park and now serves as park headquarters.\nGeography.\nFalmouth is located at (38.331790, -77.461361).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Falmouth has a total area of 3.2\u00A0square miles (8.4\u00A0km\u00B2), of which, 3.1\u00A0square miles (8.1\u00A0km\u00B2) of it is land and 0.1\u00A0square miles (0.3\u00A0km\u00B2) of it (3.09%) is water.\nDemographics.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 3,624 people, 1,323 households, and 997 families residing in the CDP.
