The meaning of Mukto-Mona is \"free mind\". The website supports free expression and criticizes religious fundamentalism, especially Islamic religious fundamentalism.\nThe Council for Secular Humanism called Mukto-Mona \"the largest and the fastest-growing collection of contemporary freethinkers in Bangladesh and within South Asia\". The group worked with international NGOs like the Center for Inquiry and the International Humanist and Ethical Union.\nThe website was moderated by Avijit Roy. Roy was killed on February 26, 2015. Ananta Bijoy Das also wrote for the blog. Das was killed on May 12, 2015. The group al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent said they were responsible for Roy's death. Ananta Bijoy Das was on a list of targets by the same group of Islamists who were behind the murder of Avijit Roy.\nHistory.\nIn May 2001, Avijit Roy started a Yahoo group called Mukto-Mona, meaning \"free mind\".

The group worked for freedom for religious minorities and secular writers. They worked with international secularist groups to protest killings and arrests.
