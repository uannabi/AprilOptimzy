{"id":549707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate","text":"=\"preserve\">A candidate, or \"nominee\", is a person (or a thing) which is being considered for something. For a person, it might be an award or honor or membership of a group. An election, for example, often chooses one or a few, among two or more candidates. The word comes from a Latin word for white, because men who wanted to be chosen would wear white so everyone would notice them.\nThe word is also used in problem-solving. In chess, a distinction is made between legal moves and candidate moves. The candidate moves are those selected for a more detailed examination.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":178},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":281},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":296},{"uri":"Problem-solving","surface_form":"problem-solving","offset":412},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":432}]}
