{"id":54979,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_period","text":"e=\"preserve\">The migration period, or barbarian invasions or V\u00F6lkerwanderung, happened in AD 300\u2013700 in Europe, at the end of ancient history and during the Early Middle Ages.\nThe migrations included the Goths, Vandals, Franks, and other Germanic, Bulgar, and Slavic tribes. They may have been influenced by attacks of the Huns in the East and may also be connected to the Turkic migrations in Central Asia, overpopulation, or climate changes. The migration period also included groups of Angles, Saxons, Frisians, and some Jutes to Britain.\nMigrations would continue well into the Middle Ages, beyond 1000 AD, with successive waves of Slavs, Alans, Avars, Bulgars, Hungarians, Pechenegs, Cumans, and Tatars that changed the ethnic makeup of Eastern Europe. Western European historians, however, tend to stress the migrations that were most relevant to Western Europe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":104},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient history","offset":126},{"uri":"Early_Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Early Middle Ages","offset":157},{"uri":"Goths","surface_form":"Goths","offset":204},{"uri":"Vandals","surface_form":"Vandals","offset":211},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Franks","offset":220},{"uri":"Germanic_tribes","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":238},{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic tribes","offset":260},{"uri":"Huns","surface_form":"Huns","offset":323},{"uri":"Overpopulation","surface_form":"overpopulation","offset":408},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":427},{"uri":"Angles","surface_form":"Angles","offset":489},{"uri":"Saxons","surface_form":"Saxons","offset":497},{"uri":"Frisians","surface_form":"Frisians","offset":505},{"uri":"Jutes","surface_form":"Jutes","offset":524},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":533},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":582},{"uri":"1000","surface_form":"1000","offset":602},{"uri":"Slavs","surface_form":"Slavs","offset":636},{"uri":"Eurasian_Avars","surface_form":"Avars","offset":650},{"uri":"Hungarians","surface_form":"Hungarians","offset":666},{"uri":"Pechenegs","surface_form":"Pechenegs","offset":678},{"uri":"Cumans","surface_form":"Cumans","offset":689},{"uri":"Tatars","surface_form":"Tatars","offset":701}]}
