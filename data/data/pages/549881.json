{"id":549881,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_boot","text":"Combat boots are military boots designed to be worn by soldiers during combat or combat training. They are not intended for wear during parades and other ceremonial duties.\nModern combat boots are designed to provide a combination of grip, ankle stability, and foot protection suitable for a rugged environment. They are traditionally made of hardened and sometimes waterproofed leather. Today, many combat boots incorporate technologies originating in civilian hiking boots, such as Gore-Tex nylon side panels, which improve ventilation and comfort. They are also often specialized for certain climates and conditions, such as jungle boots, desert boots, and cold weather boots as well as specific uses, such as tanker boots and jump boots.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":17},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":55},{"uri":"Parade","surface_form":"parade","offset":136},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":379},{"uri":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","surface_form":"Gore-Tex","offset":484}]}
