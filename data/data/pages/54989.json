{"id":54989,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_strength","text":"In physics, the field strength of a field is the magnitude (size) of its (vector) value. This means that the force exerted by the field on a given object is proportional to the field strength.\nIn differential geometry, the field strength is another name for the curvature form. For the electromagnetic field, the curvature form is an antisymmetric matrix whose elements are the electric field and magnetic field: the electromagnetic tensor.\nIn radio engineering, field strength is the strength of radio waves in a particular location.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":3},{"uri":"Field_(physics)","surface_form":"field","offset":36},{"uri":"Magnitude_(mathematics)","surface_form":"magnitude","offset":49},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":74},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":109},{"uri":"Proportionality","surface_form":"proportional","offset":157},{"uri":"Differential_geometry","surface_form":"differential geometry","offset":196},{"uri":"Curvature_form","surface_form":"curvature form","offset":262},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_field","surface_form":"electromagnetic field","offset":286},{"uri":"Antisymmetric_matrix","surface_form":"antisymmetric matrix","offset":334},{"uri":"Electric_field","surface_form":"electric field","offset":378},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":397},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_tensor","surface_form":"electromagnetic tensor","offset":417},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":444}]}
