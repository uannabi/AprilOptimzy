{"id":55,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria","text":"Austria (; officially called Republic of Austria), is a country in Central Europe. Around Austria there are the countries of Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Currently, the chancellor is Sebastian Kurz. The previous chancellor was Brigitte Bierlein (2019). Austria has been a member-state of the United Nations since 1955 the European Union since 1995 and OPEC since 2019.\nThe people in Austria speak German, a few also speak Hungarian, Slovenian and Croatian. The capital of Austria is Vienna (Wien).\nAustria is more than a thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the ninth century. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name \"Ostarrichi\" is first written in an official document from 996. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word \"\u00D6sterreich,\" which literally means \"East Empire.\"\nPolitics.\nAustria is a democratic republic. It is a neutral state, that means it does not take part in wars with other countries. It has been in the United Nations since 1955 and in the European Union since 1995.\nMore information: \"States of Austria\".\nAncient times.\nThere has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age. That was the time of the Neanderthals. They left works of art such as the Venus of Willendorf. In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for mineral resources, especially copper. \u00D6tzi, a mummy found in a glacier between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the Bronze Age people built bigger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were mineral resources. Salt mining began near Hallstatt. At that time, Celts began to form the first states.\nThe Roman cities and their modern names.\nThe Romans came 15 B.C. to Austria and made the Celtic Regnum Noricum to a province. Modern Austria was part of three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia. The border in the north was the Danube.\nModern times.\nAustria was the Austrian Empire from about 800 to 1867 and was ruled by The House of Habsburg for most of that period. Between 1867 and 1918 it was a part of Austria-Hungary. Then it became a republic. The \"First Republic\" was from 1918 to 1938. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Nazi Germany. The \"Second Republic\" was started in 1945.\nGeography.\nAustria is a largely mountainous country since it is partially in the Alps. The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country where the Danube flows.\nMusic and Arts.\nMany famous composers were Austrians or born in Austria. There are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner, Johann Strauss, Sr., Johann Strauss, Jr. and Gustav Mahler. In modern times there were Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg, who belonged to the Second Viennese School.\nAustria has many artists, there are Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele or Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Inge Morath or Otto Wagner and scienc.\nFood.\nFamous Austrian dishes are Wiener Schnitzel, Apfelstrudel, Schweinsbraten, Kaiserschmarren, Kn\u00F6del, Sachertorte and Tafelspitz. But you can also find a lot of local dishes like K\u00E4rntner Reindling (a kind of cake), K\u00E4rntner Nudeln (also called \"K\u00E4rntner Kasnudeln\", you may write it \"...nudln\" too), Tiroler Kn\u00F6dl (may be written \"...kn\u00F6del\";), Tiroler Schlipfkrapfen (another kind of \"K\u00E4rntner Nudeln\"), Salzburger Nockerl (also may be written...\"Nockerln\"), Steirisches Wurzelfleisch
