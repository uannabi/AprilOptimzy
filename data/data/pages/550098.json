{"id":550098,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-flat_major","text":"D major (or D-flat major) is a major scale based on D. Its key signature has five flats.\nIts relative minor is B minor, and its parallel minor is D minor. This is usually replaced by C\u266F minor because D\u266D minor's eight flats (including the double-flat) make it generally impractical to use. Therefore, D\u266D minor is often used as the parallel key of C\u266F minor.\nFor example, Chopin's Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major (\"Raindrop\"), modulates from D-flat major to C-sharp minor for the middle section in the parallel minor, and in his Fantaisie-Impromptu, primarily in C-sharp minor, Chopin switches to D-flat major for the middle section for the opposite reason. Claude Debussy also switches from D-flat major to C-sharp minor in the significant section in his famous Clair de lune. Anton\u00EDn Dvo\u0159\u00E1k's New World Symphony likewise switches to C-sharp minor for a while for the significant section in the slow movement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_scale","surface_form":"major scale","offset":31},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":59},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative minor","offset":93},{"uri":"B-flat_minor","surface_form":"B minor","offset":111},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel minor","offset":128},{"uri":"D-flat_minor","surface_form":"D minor","offset":146}]}
