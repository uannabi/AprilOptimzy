{"id":550099,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-flat_major","text":"C-flat major is a major scale based on C-flat. Its key signature has seven flats.\nIts relative minor is A-flat minor, and its parallel minor is C-flat minor. This is usually replaced by B minor because C\u266D minor's three double-flats make it generally impractical to use.\nIts enharmonic equivalent is B major.\nMost composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent B major because it has just five sharps.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_scale","surface_form":"major scale","offset":18},{"uri":"Key_signature","surface_form":"key signature","offset":51},{"uri":"Relative_key","surface_form":"relative minor","offset":86},{"uri":"A-flat_minor","surface_form":"A-flat minor","offset":104},{"uri":"Parallel_key","surface_form":"parallel minor","offset":126},{"uri":"Enharmonic_equivalent","surface_form":"enharmonic equivalent","offset":274},{"uri":"B_major","surface_form":"B major","offset":299},{"uri":"Enharmonic","surface_form":"enharmonic","offset":341}]}
