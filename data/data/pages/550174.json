The type specimen is \"Ceratonia siliqua\".\nThe genus was long considered monotypic (with only one species), but a second species, \"Ceratonia oreothauma\", was identified in 1979 from Oman and Somalia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":21},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering","offset":30},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":40},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":53},{"uri":"Fabaceae","surface_form":"Fabaceae","offset":65},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":75},{"uri":"Mediterranean_region","surface_form":"Mediterranean region","offset":90},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":119},{"uri":"Carob_tree","surface_form":"carob tree","offset":159},{"uri":"Pod","surface_form":"pod","offset":208},{"uri":"Caesalpinioideae","surface_form":"Caesalpinioideae","offset":307},{"uri":"Carl_Linnaeus","surface_form":"Carl Linnaeus","offset":350},{"uri":"Species_Plantarum","surface_form":"Species Plantarum","offset":382},{"uri":"Type_specimen","surface_form":"type specimen","offset":422},{"uri":"Carob_tree","surface_form":"Ceratonia siliqua","offset":440},{"uri":"Monotypic","surface_form":"monotypic","offset":490},{"uri":"Oman","surface_form":"Oman","offset":599},{"uri":"Somalia","surface_form":"Somalia","offset":608}]}
