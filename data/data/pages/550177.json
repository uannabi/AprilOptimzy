{"id":550177,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carob_tree","text":"Carob tree is a species of flowering evergreen tree in the pea family, Fabaceae. Its scientific name is \"Ceratonia siliqua\" L.\nIt is widely grown for its edible pods, and as an ornamental tree in gardens. The ripe, dried pod is often ground to carob powder, which is used to replace cocoa powder. Carob bars, an alternative to chocolate bars, are often available in health-food stores.\nNames.\nThe tree is known in English as carob tree, St John's-bread or locust bean (not to be confused with the African locust bean).\nThe word carob, used commonly for the fruit, comes from Middle French \"carobe\" (modern), which borrowed it from Arabic (\"kharr\u016Bb\", \"locust bean pod\").\n\"Ceratonia siliqua\", the scientific name of the carob tree given by Carolus Linnaeus to this plant, comes from the Greek \"ker\u00E1ti\u03BFn\" \u03BA\u03B5\u03C1\u03AC\u03C4\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD 'fruit of the carob (from \"keras\" \u03BA\u03AD\u03C1\u03B1\u03C2 'horn'), and Latin \"siliqua\" \"pod, carob\".\nThe carat, a unit of mass for gemstones, and of purity for gold, takes its name, indirectly, from the Greek word for a carob seed, \"ker\u00E1tion\".\nDescription.\nThe carob tree grows up to tall. The crown (the upper part of tree) is broad and semispherical, supported by a thick trunk with brown rough bark and solid and firm branches. Leaves are long, alternate and compound.\nMost carob trees are dioecious (with separate male an female plants) but some are hermaphrodite. The male trees do not produce fruit. The trees blossom in autumn. The flowers are small and in an inflorescence axis in racemes like catkins; the pollination is by both wind and insects.\nThe fruit is a legume (also known as a pod). The pods take a full year to develop and ripen. The sweet ripe pods eventually fall to the ground and are eaten by various mammals (goats, sheep, cows), and so the hard seeds are dispersed.\nWhere it grows.\nThe carob tree is native to the Cyprus island, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey.\nIt is generally found within 30-45\u00B0N and 30-40\u00B0S and from sea level to an altitude of.\nIt has been introduced into regions with a similar Mediterranean climate.\nFood.\nCarob eaten by humans is the dried (and sometimes roasted) pod. The pod have 5 to 18 hard brown seeds (10% of the pod weight) within a sweet thick pulp substance.\nCarob is mildly sweet and is used in powdered, chip, or syrup form as an ingredient in cakes and cookies, and as a substitute for chocolate. Carob bars are widely available in health food stores. A traditional sweet, eaten during Lent and Good Friday, is also made from carob pods in Malta.\nCarob pod meal is used as an energy-rich feed for livestock, particularly for ruminants, though its high tannin content may limit its use.\nSyrup, drinks.\nIn Cyprus, carob syrup is known as Cyprus's black gold, and is widely exported. In Malta, a syrup (\"\u0121ulepp tal-\u0127arrub\") is made out of carob pods. Carob syrup is also used in Crete as a natural sweetener, and is considered a natural source of calcium. It contains three times more calcium than milk. It is also rich in iron, phosphorus, and natural fibers (Due to its strong taste, it can be found mixed with orange or chocolate).\nCarob juice drinks are traditionally drunk during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Crushed pods may be used to make a beverage; compote, liqueur, and syrup are made from carob in Turkey, Malta, Portugal, Spain, and Sicily. Several studies suggest that carob may aid in treating diarrhea in infants.\nOrnamental.\n\"C. siliqua\" is widely planted in the horticultural as an ornamental plant for planting in Mediterranean climate and other temperate regions around the world, as in California and Hawaii. The plant can be used as a dense and large hedge.\nProduction.\nAccording to FAO, the top carob-producing countries are (in metric tonnes, 2012): \"Source: UN Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO)\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering","offset":27},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen tree","offset":37},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":59},{"uri":"Fabaceae","surface_form":"Fabaceae","offset":71},{"uri":"Binomial_nomenclature","surface_form":"scientific name","offset":85},{"uri":"Edible","surface_form":"edible","offset":154},{"uri":"Pod","surface_form":"pod","offset":161},{"uri":"Ornamental","surface_form":"ornamental","offset":177},{"uri":"Cocoa","surface_form":"cocoa","offset":283},{"uri":"Powder","surface_form":"powder","offset":289},{"uri":"Parkia_biglobosa","surface_form":"African locust bean","offset":497},{"uri":"Middle_French","surface_form":"Middle French","offset":575},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":631},{"uri":"Binomial_nomenclature","surface_form":"scientific name","offset":695},{"uri":"Carolus_Linnaeus","surface_form":"Carolus Linnaeus","offset":738},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":785},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":864},{"uri":"Pod","surface_form":"pod","offset":881},{"uri":"Carat_(mass)","surface_form":"unit of mass","offset":907},{"uri":"Carat_(purity)","surface_form":"purity","offset":942},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":996},{"uri":"Trunk_(botany)","surface_form":"trunk","offset":1167},{"uri":"Bark","surface_form":"bark","offset":1190},{"uri":"Branch","surface_form":"branch","offset":1214},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"Leaves","offset":1224},{"uri":"Flowering_plant_sexuality","surface_form":"dioecious","offset":1286},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":1311},{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":1319},{"uri":"Hermaphrodite","surface_form":"hermaphrodite","offset":1347},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"inflorescence","offset":1460},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"raceme","offset":1482},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"catkin","offset":1495},{"uri":"Pollination","surface_form":"pollination","offset":1508},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1553},{"uri":"Legume","surface_form":"legume","offset":1564},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":1726},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":1733},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":1740},{"uri":"Native_(ecology)","surface_form":"native","offset":1818},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":1832},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":1847},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":1854},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":1862},{"uri":"Lebanon","surface_form":"Lebanon","offset":1870},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":1879},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":1886},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":1900},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":1907},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":1916},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":1998},{"uri":"Mediterranean_climate","surface_form":"Mediterranean climate","offset":2062},{"uri":"Roast","surface_form":"roast","offset":2141},{"uri":"Pulp","surface_form":"pulp","offset":2238},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":2384},{"uri":"Lent","surface_form":"Lent","offset":2484},{"uri":"Good_Friday","surface_form":"Good Friday","offset":2493},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":2702},{"uri":"Syrup","surface_form":"syrup","offset":2716},{"uri":"Export","surface_form":"exported","offset":2769},{"uri":"Malta","surface_form":"Malta","offset":2782},{"uri":"Crete","surface_form":"Crete","offset":2874},{"uri":"Artificial_sweetener","surface_form":"sweetener","offset":2893},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":3184},{"uri":"Ramadan","surface_form":"Ramadan","offset":3201},{"uri":"Beverage","surface_form":"beverage","offset":3245},{"uri":"Compote","surface_form":"compote","offset":3255},{"uri":"Liqueur","surface_form":"liqueur","offset":3264},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":3461},{"uri":"Horticulture","surface_form":"horticultural","offset":3476},{"uri":"Ornamental_plant","surface_form":"ornamental plant","offset":3496},{"uri":"Mediterranean_climate","surface_form":"Mediterranean climate","offset":3529},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":3561},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":3603},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":3618},{"uri":"Hedge","surface_form":"hedge","offset":3669},{"uri":"FAO","surface_form":"FAO","offset":3701},{"uri":"Ton","surface_form":"metric tonne","offset":3748},{"uri":"UN_Food_%26amp%3B_Agriculture_Organisation","surface_form":"UN Food & Agriculture Organisation","offset":3779}]}
