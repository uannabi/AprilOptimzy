{"id":5504,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man","text":"A man is a male adult human. He is the opposite of a woman. People use the word \"man\" (one \"man\", two or more \"men\") to talk about gender. Manhood is the period in a male's life after he changes from a boy. A boy is a male child; a female child is called a girl. After boys reach maturity, they can be called a man.\nLike most other male mammals, a man inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father. The men's rights movement is a group that tries to fight for men's rights and opposes misandry.\nSomeone who changes gender to male would also be called a man.\nBiology and gender.\nThere are some sexual differences between a man and a woman. Men have sex organs which we call \"external\" (not inside the body). But many parts of the male reproductive system are internal too. The study of male reproduction and sex organs is \"andrology\".\nMen normally have the same illnesses as women, but there are some sexual illnesses which men have only, or more often.\nThere are more differences between men and women, not only sexual differences.\nBiology is not the only thing which makes people feel they are men, or that other people are men. Perhaps one in 100,000 men were born without a male body. We call these \"transgender\" or \"transsexual\" men. Some men can have a hormone or chromosomal difference (for example \"androgen insensitivity syndrome\"). Some men have other intersex conditions. Some of those intersex people who people said were female (girls) when they were born want to change this later in their lives.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":11},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":16},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":22},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":53},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":131},{"uri":"Boy","surface_form":"boy","offset":202},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":223},{"uri":"Girl","surface_form":"girl","offset":257},{"uri":"Age_of_majority","surface_form":"maturity","offset":280},{"uri":"X_chromosome","surface_form":"X chromosome","offset":364},{"uri":"Y_chromosome","surface_form":"Y chromosome","offset":399},{"uri":"Men%27s_rights_movement","surface_form":"men's rights movement","offset":433},{"uri":"Misandry","surface_form":"misandry","offset":515},{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"changes gender","offset":537},{"uri":"Sex_organ","surface_form":"sex organ","offset":678},{"uri":"Andrology","surface_form":"andrology","offset":852},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"Biology","offset":1062},{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"transgender","offset":1233},{"uri":"Transsexual","surface_form":"transsexual","offset":1250},{"uri":"Intersex","surface_form":"intersex","offset":1391}]}
