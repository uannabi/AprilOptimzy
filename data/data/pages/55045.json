{"id":55045,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable","text":"e=\"preserve\">A fable is a type of story which shows something in life or has a meaning to a word. A fable teaches a lesson or suggests a moral from it. A fable starts in the middle of the story, that means, jumps into the main event without detailed introduction of characters. The characters of a fable may be animals, plants and legendary creatures. When animals are used in fables, they think and talk like people, even though they act like animals. For example, in a fable a clay pot might say that it is frightened of being broken.\nThe stories told by fables are usually very simple. To understand a fable, the reader or listener does not need to know all about the characters, only one important thing. For this reason animals are often used in fables in a way that is easily understood because it is always the same. They keep the same \"characteristics\" from story to story.\nThe most famous fables are those attributed to Aesop (6th century B.C.). Many fables are so well-known that their morals have become English sayings.\n\"Crying wolf\" is another well-known English saying. This comes from \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\". This fable is about a boy who was sent to mind the sheep. The boy got lonely while minding the sheep, so he shouted \"Wolf! Wolf!\" The people came running. The next day, he did it again and they were very angry. On the third day the boy saw a wolf. He cried \"Wolf! Wolf!\" but no one came and the wolf ate him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"story","offset":34},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":311},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":320},{"uri":"Legendary_creature","surface_form":"legendary creature","offset":331},{"uri":"Aesop","surface_form":"Aesop","offset":929},{"uri":"The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf","surface_form":"The Boy Who Cried Wolf","offset":1101}]}
