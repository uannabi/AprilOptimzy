{"id":55070,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_200","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Global 200 is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as priorities for conservation. According to the WWF, an ecoregion is defined as a \"relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species, dynamics, and environmental conditions (Dinerstein et al. 1995, TNC 1997).\"\nThe WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200: critical or endangered; vulnerable; and relatively stable or intact. Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ecoregion","surface_form":"ecoregion","offset":44},{"uri":"World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature","surface_form":"World Wide Fund for Nature","offset":73}]}
