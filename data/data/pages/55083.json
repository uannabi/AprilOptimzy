The city is located about 100\u00A0km south-east of Lake Baikal. It sits at the foot of the Khamar-Daban and Khrebet Ulan-Burgasy mountain ranges, next to the confluence of the Selenga River and its tributary, the Uda. The city is divided into two parts by the Uda. Population 359,391 (2002 Census); 352,530 (1989 Census). It is the third largest city in East Siberia. It is served by Ulan-Ude Airport (Mukhino) as well as the smaller Ulan-Ude Vostochny Airport.\nUlan-Ude was founded in 1666 by the Russian Cossacks. Due to its geographical position, the city grew rapidly and became a large trade centre which connected Russia with China and Mongolia. There are old merchants' mansions richly decorated with wood and stone carving in the historical center of Ulan-Ude, along the river banks. They represent beautiful examples of Russian classicism. There is also a large and highly unusual head of Lenin in the central square.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":10},{"uri":"Buryat_language","surface_form":"Buryat","offset":30},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":81},{"uri":"Buryatia","surface_form":"Buryat Republic","offset":101},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":118},{"uri":"Lake_Baikal","surface_form":"Lake Baikal","offset":173},{"uri":"Khamar-Daban","surface_form":"Khamar-Daban","offset":213},{"uri":"Khrebet_Ulan-Burgasy","surface_form":"Khrebet Ulan-Burgasy","offset":230},{"uri":"Confluence_(geography)","surface_form":"confluence","offset":280},{"uri":"Selenga_River","surface_form":"Selenga River","offset":298},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":320},{"uri":"Uda_River%2C_Buryatia","surface_form":"Uda","offset":335},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":481},{"uri":"Ulan-Ude_Airport","surface_form":"Ulan-Ude Airport","offset":506},{"uri":"Ulan-Ude_Vostochny_Airport","surface_form":"Ulan-Ude Vostochny Airport","offset":556},{"uri":"Cossack","surface_form":"Cossack","offset":628},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":742},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":754},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":764},{"uri":"Lenin","surface_form":"Lenin","offset":1020}]}
