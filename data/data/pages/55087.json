{"id":55087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_zone","text":"The pelagic zone is the part of the open sea or ocean that is not near the coast or sea floor. The name comes from the Greek \u03C0\u03AD\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2 (\"p\u00E9lagos\"), which might be roughly translated as \"sea\" but is more accurately translated as \"open sea.\"\nSub-zones.\nThe last three zones are similar in character, and some marine biologists count them as a single zone or consider the latter two to be the one zone. Some define the hadopelagic as waters below 6000 meters, whether in a trench or not.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":41},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":48},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":75},{"uri":"Benthos","surface_form":"sea floor","offset":84},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":119},{"uri":"Marine_biology","surface_form":"marine biologists","offset":305}]}
