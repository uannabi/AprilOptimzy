{"id":55098,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins","text":"e=\"preserve\">The B vitamin complex (also called B vitamins) are a group of 8 vitamins. They have an important job in the metabolism of cells. Each B vitamin is a cofactor (a coenzyme) for some key metabolic processes or it is a precursor needed to make one.\nOriginally, people thought they were just different forms of one vitamin (as with Vitamin D, for example). Later it turned out that they are separate vitamins that often can be found together. They are Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin,Pantothenic acid, Vitamin B6, Biotin, Folic acid and Vitamin B12. They are required for growth, and proper functioning of nerves and muscles. B vitamins are found in meat, milk, whole grains and fresh vegetables.\nWell-known medical syndromes caused by thiamine deficiency are beri-beri, Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), and optic neuropathy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":77},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":121},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":135},{"uri":"Cofactor_(biochemistry)","surface_form":"cofactor","offset":162},{"uri":"Coenzyme","surface_form":"coenzyme","offset":174},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolic","offset":197},{"uri":"Precursor","surface_form":"precursor","offset":228},{"uri":"Vitamin_D","surface_form":"Vitamin D","offset":340},{"uri":"Thiamine","surface_form":"Thiamine","offset":460},{"uri":"Riboflavin","surface_form":"Riboflavin","offset":470},{"uri":"Niacin","surface_form":"Niacin","offset":482},{"uri":"Pantothenic_acid","surface_form":"Pantothenic acid","offset":489},{"uri":"Vitamin_B6","surface_form":"Vitamin B6","offset":507},{"uri":"Biotin","surface_form":"Biotin","offset":519},{"uri":"Folic_acid","surface_form":"Folic acid","offset":527},{"uri":"Vitamin_B12","surface_form":"Vitamin B12","offset":542},{"uri":"Syndrome","surface_form":"syndrome","offset":721},{"uri":"Beriberi","surface_form":"beri-beri","offset":765},{"uri":"Wernicke%E2%80%93Korsakoff_syndrome","surface_form":"Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome","offset":776},{"uri":"Optic_neuropathy","surface_form":"optic neuropathy","offset":815}]}
