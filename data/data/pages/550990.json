{"id":550990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities_in_Azerbaijan","text":"e=\"preserve\">This article is about the ethnic minorities in Azerbaijan.\nAlthough more than 91% of the people are ethnic Azerbaijanis, Azerbaijan has many ethnic minorities including Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians, Jews and other minorities. However the numbers of most of these ethnic minorities are small.\nAfter the end of the Soviet Union with the independence of Azerbaijan and the Nagorno-Karabakh War, almost all Armenians (outside the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh) fled or were deported from the country. At the same time, almost all Azerbaijanis fled or were deported from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.\nMost Russians and other minorities have also left the country and are continuing to leave the country. As a result, Azerbaijan has become ethnically more \"pure\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic minorities","offset":39},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":60},{"uri":"Azerbaijanis","surface_form":"Azerbaijanis","offset":120},{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russians","offset":182},{"uri":"Ukrainians","surface_form":"Ukrainians","offset":192},{"uri":"Georgians","surface_form":"Georgians","offset":204},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":215},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":329},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":351},{"uri":"Nagorno-Karabakh_War","surface_form":"Nagorno-Karabakh War","offset":386},{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenians","offset":419},{"uri":"Separatist","surface_form":"separatist","offset":442},{"uri":"Nagorno-Karabakh","surface_form":"Nagorno-Karabakh","offset":463},{"uri":"Refugee","surface_form":"fled","offset":481},{"uri":"Deportation","surface_form":"deported","offset":494},{"uri":"Purity","surface_form":"pure","offset":775}]}
