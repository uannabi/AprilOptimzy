{"id":551207,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sirtuin or Sir2 proteins are a class of enzymes that are important in cell biology.\nSirtuins regulate important biological pathways in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The name Sir2 comes from the yeast gene 'silent mating-type information regulation 2', the gene responsible for cellular regulation in yeast.\nSirtuins influence many cellular processes like ageing, transcription, apoptosis, inflammation and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and alertness during low-calorie situations. Sirtuins can also control circadian clocks and mitochondrial biogenesis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":53},{"uri":"Cell_biology","surface_form":"cell biology","offset":83},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":148},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":158},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryote","offset":170},{"uri":"Yeast","surface_form":"yeast","offset":317},{"uri":"Ageing","surface_form":"ageing","offset":372},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":380},{"uri":"Apoptosis","surface_form":"apoptosis","offset":395},{"uri":"Inflammation","surface_form":"inflammation","offset":406},{"uri":"Mitochondria","surface_form":"mitochondria","offset":563}]}
