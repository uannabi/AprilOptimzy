{"id":551212,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euryale","text":"=\"preserve\">Euryale is one of the gorgons in Greek myth. Her sisters are Stheno and the infamous Medusa. All three were once ravishing young women, particularly Medusa, who also happened to a priestess in the temple of Athena and took a vow of chastity, until she was raped by Poseidon. This was much to the ire of Athena and to punish Medusa, she had her and her sisters, who had been watching, turned into monsters with snakes for hair and a killer gaze, which turned onlookers into stone. The trio of sisters were later banished to a remote island.\nA side effect of the transformation was that while Medusa's sisters were immortal, she herself wasn't, which would lead to Perseus killing her. Euryale is well known for her loud cries, particularly after her younger sister's death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gorgon","surface_form":"gorgon","offset":34},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek","offset":45},{"uri":"Stheno","surface_form":"Stheno","offset":73},{"uri":"Medusa","surface_form":"Medusa","offset":97},{"uri":"Athena","surface_form":"Athena","offset":219},{"uri":"Chastity","surface_form":"chastity","offset":244},{"uri":"Poseidon","surface_form":"Poseidon","offset":277},{"uri":"Side_effect","surface_form":"side effect","offset":554},{"uri":"Immortal","surface_form":"immortal","offset":625},{"uri":"Perseus","surface_form":"Perseus","offset":675}]}
