It is found in very arid places of southern South America. It is a deciduous tree that loses its leaves in winter with the cold and also in summer if it gets too dry.\nDescription.\nThe trunk of \"Geoffroea decorticans\" grows vertically when grows alone but the plant looks like a shrub when it grows inside the forest. The tree grows up to tall.\nThe trunk could have up to in diameter, with yellow bark that peels off, revealing the underneath young green bark. The plant has many branches and many leaves, and the tree have a rounded look in its upper part.\nThe flowers are very visible, small, papery and yellow-coloured. The tree produces flowers in spring (September to October, in the Southern hemisphere), either singly or in groups (\"clusters)\", and produces fruits from November to January.\n\"Geoffroea decorticans\" is unique among legumes in that it produces fleshy, oval pods that hold a single seed. Fruits are initially green but turn deep orange as they mature.\nName.\nThe second name of the species, \" decorticans\", means that the bark of the trunk peels off.\nCommon names for this tree are \"cha\u00F1ar\", Chilean palo verde and \"kumbaru\".\nWhere it grows.\nThe plant grows naturally in very dry regions in South America. \"Geoffroea decorticans\" is found in Argentina (northwest and central), Bolivia, northern Chile, western Paraguay, southern Peru and western Uruguay.\nThe \"cha\u00F1ar\" grows from sea level up to above sea level. In Chile, it grows in the Arica and Parinacota, Tarapac\u00E1, Antofagasta, Atacama and Coquimbo regions, and grows in groups called, in plural (in singular).\nUses.\n\"Geoffroea decorticans\" is an average tree with a wood moderately hard and dense, good for carpentry and furniture making. It is also used as firewood and to make cheap posts (tall sticks) for fences.\nThe fruits are sweet and can be eaten, as well as the seeds; both are used as human and animal feed. The fruits are very commonly used for both cooking and medical purposes in the processed form of cha\u00F1ar molasses.\nBecause they produce many bright, yellow flowers, \"Geoffroea decorticans\" is also used as ornamental plants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":49},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":61},{"uri":"Fabaceae","surface_form":"Fabaceae","offset":73},{"uri":"Arid","surface_form":"arid","offset":103},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":127},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":150},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":180},{"uri":"Trunk_(botany)","surface_form":"trunk","offset":267},{"uri":"Vertical","surface_form":"vertical","offset":306},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":361},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":457},{"uri":"Bark","surface_form":"bark","offset":479},{"uri":"Peel","surface_form":"peels","offset":489},{"uri":"Reveal","surface_form":"revealing","offset":500},{"uri":"Underneath","surface_form":"underneath","offset":514},{"uri":"Branch","surface_form":"branch","offset":562},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":580},{"uri":"Visible","surface_form":"visible","offset":661},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":677},{"uri":"Southern_hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern hemisphere","offset":771},{"uri":"Cluster","surface_form":"clusters","offset":822},{"uri":"Legumes","surface_form":"legumes","offset":920},{"uri":"Pod","surface_form":"pod","offset":961},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1293},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1344},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":1379},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1397},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":1412},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":1431},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":1448},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1481},{"uri":"Arica_y_Parinacota_Region","surface_form":"Arica and Parinacota","offset":1540},{"uri":"Tarapac%C3%A1_Region","surface_form":"Tarapac\u00E1","offset":1562},{"uri":"Antofagasta_Region","surface_form":"Antofagasta","offset":1572},{"uri":"Atacama_Region","surface_form":"Atacama","offset":1585},{"uri":"Coquimbo_Region","surface_form":"Coquimbo","offset":1597},{"uri":"Regions_of_Chile","surface_form":"regions","offset":1606},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":1646},{"uri":"Singular","surface_form":"singular","offset":1657},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":1724},{"uri":"Carpentry","surface_form":"carpentry","offset":1765},{"uri":"Furniture","surface_form":"furniture","offset":1779},{"uri":"Firewood","surface_form":"firewood","offset":1816},{"uri":"Post","surface_form":"posts","offset":1843},{"uri":"Stick","surface_form":"stick","offset":1855},{"uri":"Fence","surface_form":"fence","offset":1867},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooking","offset":2019},{"uri":"Molasses","surface_form":"molasses","offset":2080},{"uri":"Ornamental","surface_form":"ornamental","offset":2180}]}
