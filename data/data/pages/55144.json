He was killed by a car bomb. He was assassinated on May 20, 2002.\nJihad Ahmed Jibril was the leader of the military wing of the PFLP-GC and was the heir apparent of the organization before he was killed in a car bombing in Beirut in 2002. The assassination was blamed on Israel, although Jibril had many other enemies, including the Lebanese Christian militia and other Palestinian nationalist organizations.\nAhmed Jibril was co-leader of the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Israeli radio reports said that the son, Jihad Ahmed Jibril, was involved in smuggling arms and explosives to Palestinian militants in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nBut there was no evidence to directly link him with terrorist attacks.\nAhmed Jibril accused the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, of responsibility for the killing, but a spokesman for Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said Israel was not involved.\nIn mid-June 2006, Lebanon authorities arrested a group of alleged spies who reportedly confessed to working for Israel and carrying out the attacks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Damascus","surface_form":"Damascus","offset":59},{"uri":"Beirut","surface_form":"Beirut","offset":86},{"uri":"Ahmed_Jibril","surface_form":"Ahmed Jibril","offset":109},{"uri":"Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine-General_Command","surface_form":"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command","offset":138},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":230},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":234},{"uri":"Leader","surface_form":"leader","offset":304},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":318},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":482},{"uri":"Enemy","surface_form":"enemies","offset":521},{"uri":"Lebanese_Christian","surface_form":"Lebanese Christian","offset":544},{"uri":"Militia","surface_form":"militia","offset":563},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":581},{"uri":"Nationalist","surface_form":"nationalist","offset":593},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":605},{"uri":"Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine-General_Command","surface_form":"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command","offset":663},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":734},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":943},{"uri":"Benjamin_Ben-Eliezer","surface_form":"Benjamin Ben-Eliezer","offset":1096},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1159}]}
