{"id":551538,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Chodesh","text":"=\"preserve\">Rosh Chodesh or Rosh Hodesh (; trans. \"Beginning of the Month\"; lit. \"Head of the Month\") is the name for the first day of every month in the Hebrew calendar, marked by the birth of a new moon. It is considered a minor holiday, like the middle days of Passover and Sukkot.\nWhen a Hebrew calendar month is 30 days long, day 30 is considered Rosh Chodesh of the next month. Then Rosh Chodesh is two days long: day 30 of the old month and day 1 of the new month.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"trans","offset":43},{"uri":"Literal_translation","surface_form":"lit","offset":76},{"uri":"Hebrew_calendar","surface_form":"Hebrew calendar","offset":154},{"uri":"New_moon","surface_form":"new moon","offset":196},{"uri":"Passover","surface_form":"Passover","offset":264},{"uri":"Sukkot","surface_form":"Sukkot","offset":277}]}
