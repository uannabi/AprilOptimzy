{"id":55161,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauban","text":"Montauban () is a \"commune\" in the Tarn-et-Garonne department in the Midi-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es region in southern France. It is the \"pr\u00E9fecture\" (capital) of the department.\nThe town, built mainly with reddish bricks, is on the right bank of the Tarn river at its confluence with the Tescou. It was one of the first bastides in history.\nHistory.\nTogether with Mont-de-Marsan, Montauban is one of the oldest towns with walls (a bastide) in southern France. It was founded in 1144 by Alphonse Jourdain, Count of Toulouse. Most of the inhabitants came from Montauriol, a village which had grown up around the neighbouring monastery of St Th\u00E9odard.\nIn the 13th century the town suffered much during the Albigensian Crusade and from the Inquisition, but by 1317 it had recovered sufficiently to be chosen by the Pope John XXII as the head of a diocese of which the basilica of St Th\u00E9odard became the cathedral.\nIn 1360, under the Treaty of Br\u00E9tigny, the town was given to the English; they were expelled by the inhabitants in 1414. In 1560 the bishops became Protestants; ten years later it became one of the four Huguenot strongholds under the Peace of Saint-Germain, and formed a small independent republic.\nIn 1790, Montauban was in the Lot department as the capital of a district; with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in 1800, Montauban became a \"sous-pr\u00E9fecture\" in the Lot department. When Napoleon created the Tarn-et-Garonne department in 1809, Montauban became the pr\u00E9fecture (capital) of the new department.\nGeography.\nMontauban is at about to the north of Toulouse, on the confluence of the Tescou and the Tarn rivers, and at from Agen (\"pr\u00E9fecture\" of the Lot-et-Garonne), from Albi (\"pr\u00E9fecture\" of the Tarn) and at about from Cahors (\"pr\u00E9fecture\" of the Lot).\nIt has an area of and its average altitude is; at the city hall, the altitude is.\nMontauban is surrounded by the \"communes\" Villemade, Piquecos, Lamothe-Capdeville, Albias, Saint-\u00C9tienne-de-Tulmont, L\u00E9ojac, Saint-Nauphary,Corbarieu,Bressols, Lacourt-Saint-Pierre, Montbeton and Albefeuille-Lagarde.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Montauban, in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification, is Cfb - Oceanic climate with template summers.\nThe average amount of precipitation for the year in Montauban is.
