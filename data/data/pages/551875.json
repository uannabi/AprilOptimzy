{"id":551875,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof","text":"In mathematics, a constructive proof is a method of proof that shows the existence of a mathematical object\u2014by giving a method on how to create the object. The other type of proof is called non-constructive proof, or existence proof: It shows that an object must exist, but does not give a way how to construct it.\nA non-constructive proof is rejected by the so-called constructivists, who choose to interpret existence in a stricter way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Mathematical_proof","surface_form":"proof","offset":52},{"uri":"Constructivism_(mathematics)","surface_form":"constructivists","offset":369}]}
