Lazio is an Italian football club based in Formello (Via di Santa Cornelia 1000, 00060 Formello).\nThey play in light blue shirts, white shorts and socks. The name Lazio was chosen as the original founders wanted to name the club after something which was greater and encompassed more than just the city that they were from - Lazio is the name of the region where Rome is. The sky blue and white team colors were inspired by the Greek flag and more specifically the country which gave birth to Olympic tradition; the eagle as an acknowledgement by its founders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":17},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":25},{"uri":"Formello","surface_form":"Formello","offset":48},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":303},{"uri":"Lazio","surface_form":"Lazio","offset":330},{"uri":"Flag_of_Greece","surface_form":"Greek flag","offset":433},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":470}]}
