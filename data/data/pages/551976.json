{"id":551976,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterical_strength","text":"Hysterical strength or superhuman strength is a display of extreme strength by humans beyond the normal. Hysterical strength usually occurs in life or death situations. The usual explanation is a sudden release of adrenaline (epinephrine). There have been numerous reports of people exhibition hysterical strength while feeling negitive side effects on drugs like LSD, Phencyclidine and flakka and even fighting with the police.\nIn life or death situations.\nIn 1982, in Lawrenceville, Georgia, Tony Cavallo was repairing a 1964 Chevrolet Impala automobile from underneath. The vehicle was propped up with jacks, but it fell. Cavallo's mother, Mrs. Angela Cavallo, lifted the car high enough and long enough for two neighbours to replace the jacks and pull Tony from beneath the car.\nIn 2006, in Tucson, Arizona, Tom Boyle watched as a Chevrolet Camaro hit 18-year-old Kyle Holtrust. The car pinned Holtrust, still alive, underneath. Boyle lifted the Camaro off the teenager, while the driver of the car pulled the teen to safety.\nIn 2011, in Tampa, Florida, 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), 295 lb (134 kg; 21.1 st) University of South Florida college football player Danous Estenor lifted a 3,500 lb (1,600 kg) car off of a man who had been caught underneath. The man was a tow truck driver who had been pinned under the rear tire of a 1990 Cadillac Seville, which had lurched forward as he worked underneath it. The man suffered only minor injuries.\nIn 2015, in Vienna, Virginia, Charlotte Heffelmire was able to momentarily use incredible strength to free her dad from a GMC pick-up truck.\nUnder the influence of drugs.\nIn healthy people at oral therapeutic doses, amphetamine has been shown to increase physical strength, acceleration, stamina, and endurance, while reducing reaction time. Like methylphenidate and bupropion, amphetamine increases stamina and endurance in humans mainly through the release of dopamine, and other central nervous system effects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Humans","surface_form":"humans","offset":79},{"uri":"Adrenaline","surface_form":"adrenaline","offset":214},{"uri":"Epinephrine","surface_form":"epinephrine","offset":226},{"uri":"LSD","surface_form":"LSD","offset":364},{"uri":"Phencyclidine","surface_form":"Phencyclidine","offset":369},{"uri":"Flakka","surface_form":"flakka","offset":387},{"uri":"Lawrenceville%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Lawrenceville, Georgia","offset":470},{"uri":"Tucson%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Tucson, Arizona","offset":795},{"uri":"Tampa%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Tampa, Florida","offset":1042},{"uri":"Vienna%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Vienna, Virginia","offset":1451},{"uri":"Amphetamine","surface_form":"amphetamine","offset":1655},{"uri":"Reaction_time","surface_form":"reaction time","offset":1766},{"uri":"Methylphenidate","surface_form":"methylphenidate","offset":1786},{"uri":"Bupropion","surface_form":"bupropion","offset":1806},{"uri":"Dopamine","surface_form":"dopamine","offset":1901},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":1921}]}
