{"id":552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource","text":"A natural resource is what people can use which comes from the natural environment. Examples of natural resources are air, water, wood, oil, wind energy, natural gas, iron, and coal.\nThe dividing line between natural resources and man-made resources is not clear-cut. Hydro-electric energy is not a natural resource because people use turbines to convert the energy from moving water. Petroleum and iron ores are natural, but need work to make them into usable refined oil and steel. Atomic energy comes from metallic nuclear fuel<nowiki/>s, like fissionable uranium and plutonium, but natural rocks need technical work to make them into these nuclear fuels.\nSupply.\nWe often say there are two sorts of natural resources: renewable resources and non-renewable resources.\nMost natural resources are limited. This means they will eventually run out. A perpetual resource has a never-ending supply. Some examples of perpetual resources include solar energy, tidal energy, and wind energy. There may be a limit to how much can be taken in a given day or year, but that amount can be taken again next day or next year.\nSome of the things influencing supply of resources include whether it is able to be recycled, and the availability of suitable substitutes for the material. Non-renewable resources cannot be recycled. For example, fossil fuels cannot be recycled.\nDemand.\nThe demand for resources can change with new technology, new needs, and new economics (e.g. changes in cost of the resources). Some material can go completely out of use, if people do not want it any more. Demand of many natural resources is very high, but availability of some, such as precious metals, is very low.\nAvailability.\nDifferent places have different natural resources. When people do not have a certain resource they need, they can either replace it with another resource, or trade with another country to get the resource. People have sometimes fought to have them (for example, spices, water, arable farmland, gold, or petroleum).\nWhen people do not have some resources, their quality of life can get lower. So, people protect resources. When they can not get clean water, people may become ill; if there is not enough wood, trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time (deforestation); if there are not enough fish in a sea, people can die of starvation. Renewable resources include crops, wind, hydroelectric power, fish, and sunlight. Many people carefully save their natural resources so that others can use them in future.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Natural_environment","surface_form":"natural environment","offset":63},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":118},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":123},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":130},{"uri":"Crude_oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":136},{"uri":"Wind_energy","surface_form":"wind energy","offset":141},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":154},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":167},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":177},{"uri":"Hydro-electric_energy","surface_form":"Hydro-electric energy","offset":268},{"uri":"Turbine","surface_form":"turbine","offset":335},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"Petroleum","offset":385},{"uri":"Iron_ore","surface_form":"iron ore","offset":399},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":477},{"uri":"Nuclear_fuel","surface_form":"nuclear fuel","offset":518},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"uranium","offset":559},{"uri":"Plutonium","surface_form":"plutonium","offset":571},{"uri":"Solar_energy","surface_form":"solar energy","offset":941},{"uri":"Tidal_energy","surface_form":"tidal energy","offset":955},{"uri":"Wind_energy","surface_form":"wind energy","offset":973},{"uri":"Recycling","surface_form":"recycled","offset":1198},{"uri":"Fossil_fuel","surface_form":"fossil fuel","offset":1328},{"uri":"Demand","surface_form":"demand","offset":1373},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":1414},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":1445},{"uri":"Precious_metal","surface_form":"precious metal","offset":1656},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":1858},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"fought","offset":1928},{"uri":"Spice","surface_form":"spice","offset":1962},{"uri":"Farmland","surface_form":"farmland","offset":1984},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":1994},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"petroleum","offset":2003},{"uri":"Quality_of_life","surface_form":"quality of life","offset":2061},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"ill","offset":2175},{"uri":"Deforestation","surface_form":"deforestation","offset":2268},{"uri":"Starvation","surface_form":"starvation","offset":2341},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":2381},{"uri":"Sunlight","surface_form":"sunlight","offset":2425}]}
