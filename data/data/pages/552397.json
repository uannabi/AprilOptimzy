{"id":552397,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_(river)","text":"The Reno () is a river of northeastern Italy that starts in the Northern Apennines mountain range in Tuscany but flows mainly through the Emilia-Romagna region. It is one of the longest river in Italy.\nGeography.\nThe Reno river has a length of, and a drainage basin with an area of approximately.\nCourse.\nThe Reno river starts in the Apennines to the northwest of the city of Pistoia, Pistoia province (Tuscany). The Reno is formed by the confluence, at about above sea level, of two streams: Reno di Prunetta (with its source at an altitude of) and the Reno di Campolungo.\nIts upper course, going to the west, marks the border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. In this part, there are several artificial reservoirs whose dams are used for hydro-electric energy production.\nIn Sant'Agostino, the river turns to the southwest and passes west of Bologna, at Casalecchio di Reno.\nIn its lower course the Reno receives the water of numerous streams, some of which are seasonal (they have water only when it rains)\nThe Reno was a tributary of the Po until the middle of the 18th century when the course was changed to avoid the frequent floods. It now joins the Adriatic Sea near Casalborsetti, south-east of the \"Valli di Comacchio\", a lagoon in the commune of Comacchio.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":17},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":39},{"uri":"Apennines","surface_form":"Apennines","offset":73},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":83},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":101},{"uri":"Emilia-Romagna","surface_form":"Emilia-Romagna","offset":138},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":251},{"uri":"Apennines","surface_form":"Apennines","offset":334},{"uri":"Pistoia","surface_form":"Pistoia","offset":376},{"uri":"Province_of_Pistoia","surface_form":"Pistoia","offset":385},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":403},{"uri":"Confluence","surface_form":"confluence","offset":439},{"uri":"Above_sea_level","surface_form":"above sea level","offset":460},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":484},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":520},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":533},{"uri":"Artificial","surface_form":"artificial","offset":696},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":707},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":724},{"uri":"Hydropower","surface_form":"hydro-electric","offset":742},{"uri":"Sant%27Agostino%2C_Emilia%E2%80%93Romagna","surface_form":"Sant'Agostino","offset":779},{"uri":"Bologna","surface_form":"Bologna","offset":846},{"uri":"Casalecchio_di_Reno","surface_form":"Casalecchio di Reno","offset":858},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":966},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1027},{"uri":"Po_(river)","surface_form":"Po","offset":1044},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":1134},{"uri":"Adriatic_Sea","surface_form":"Adriatic Sea","offset":1159},{"uri":"Casalborsetti","surface_form":"Casalborsetti","offset":1177},{"uri":"Lagoon","surface_form":"lagoon","offset":1234},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":1248},{"uri":"Comacchio","surface_form":"Comacchio","offset":1259}]}
