{"id":552465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Reductio ad Hitlerum\", also known as playing the Hitler card, is a logical fallacy described by Leo Strauss, a philosopher, in 1951. It happens when someone compares their opponent's view with Hitler or something that he did.\nIt is a form of ad hominem, distracting from the argument by criticizing the opponent. It works because in the modern world, people think of Nazism as a bad thing.\nDuring the 2016 US Presidential Election, Republican candidate Donald J. Trump has been repeatedly compared to Hitler by commentators and comedians.\nAs person 2 has criticized the opponent as opposed to the argument by comparing them to Hitler without giving any reasons as to why X is not true, they have committed reductio ad Hitlerum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":63},{"uri":"Logical_fallacy","surface_form":"logical fallacy","offset":81},{"uri":"Leo_Strauss","surface_form":"Leo Strauss","offset":110},{"uri":"Hitler","surface_form":"Hitler","offset":207},{"uri":"Ad_hominem","surface_form":"ad hominem","offset":256},{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazism","offset":381},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016 US Presidential Election","offset":415},{"uri":"Republican","surface_form":"Republican","offset":446},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald J.
