He spent most of his time as a teacher of political science at the University of Chicago, where he taught students and put into print 15 books.\nHe was particularly concerned with the idea of whether freedom and excellence could go together, but his ideas were criticised by Nicholas Xenos as wanting to go back to an era of fascism.\nHe was against the idea of a world state as he thought it would lead to tyranny.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":84},{"uri":"Political_science","surface_form":"political science","offset":277},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":302},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"fascism","offset":559},{"uri":"World_state","surface_form":"world state","offset":597},{"uri":"Tyranny","surface_form":"tyranny","offset":640}]}
