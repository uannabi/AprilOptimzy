{"id":55250,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo","text":"A placebo is a treatment for a disease or condition which is deliberately ineffective. The motive usually is that if a person believes that a medicine, diet, or other treatment is good for himself or herself, then it is good for the person.\nSometimes sick people who receive a placebo feel like they are getting better, and sometimes their bodies actually do get better. When patients have that response, it is called the \"placebo effect\". The term \"placebo effect\" (or \"placebo response\") was introduced in 1920. It is the response of the subject which causes the observed effect, not the substance.\nOrigins.\nJohn Haygarth tested a placebo effect in the 18th century. It showed \"to a degree which has never been suspected, what powerful influence upon diseases is produced by mere imagination\".\n\u00C9mile Cou\u00E9, a French apothecary, working between 1882 and 1910, discovered what later came to be known as the \"Placebo effect\". He reassured his clients by praising each remedy's efficiency and leaving a small positive notice with each medication. In 1901 Cou\u00E9 began to study under hypnosis. In 1913, Cou\u00E9 and his wife founded \"La Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 Lorraine de Psychologie appliqu\u00E9e\". His book \"Self-mastery through conscious autosuggestion\" was published in England (1920) and in the United States (1922).\nPlacebos and blind trial.\nPlacebos are used as part of blind trials. Blind trials work like this: Some people are given the medicine or treatment being tested, and others are given the placebo. No one knows who gets the real treatment and who gets the placebo. They are \"blind\" to their treatment.\nIf researchers notice that the \"treatment group\" is different from the \"placebo group\" they will know that the difference is because of the treatment. Without a \"placebo group\" then researchers cannot know if those changes would have happened anyway, no matter which medicine people had taken.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":31},{"uri":"Motive","surface_form":"motive","offset":91},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":152},{"uri":"%C3%89mile_Cou%C3%A9","surface_form":"\u00C9mile Cou\u00E9","offset":796},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":810},{"uri":"Apothecary","surface_form":"apothecary","offset":817}]}
