{"id":552719,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakkal_Museum","text":"The Arrakkal Museum is a museum dedicated to the Arakkal family, the only Muslim royal family in Kerala, South India. The museum is actually a section of the \"Arakkalkettu\"(Arakkal Royal Palace). The durbar hall section of the palace has been converted into a museum by the Government of Kerala. It was opened in July 2005 after a Rs. 9,000,000 renovation.\nAlthough renovated by the government, the \"Arakkalkettu\" is still owned by the \"Arakkal Royal Trust\" and does not fall under the control of the country's archaeology department, the Archaeological Survey of India. The government had taken a keen interest in preserving the heritage of the Arakkal Family, which had played a prominent role in the history of Malabar. A nominal entry fee is charged by the \"Arakkal Royal Trust\" from visitors to the museum.\nLocation.\nThe Arakkal Museum is in Ayikkara, next to the Kannur City. It is 2-3 kilometres from Kannur town.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":25},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":74},{"uri":"Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala","offset":97},{"uri":"South_India","surface_form":"South India","offset":105},{"uri":"Kannur","surface_form":"Kannur","offset":908}]}
