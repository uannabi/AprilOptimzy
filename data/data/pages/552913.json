This uses the 60th Street Tunnel to travel under the East River between Queens and Manhattan. It also ran in Brooklyn until 2004, serving the BMT Fourth Avenue and West End lines. The W is in service as of April 7, 2020. There was a six year delay due to Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA, budget cuts on June 25, 2010.\nRoute.\nThe W runs on weekdays from 6:00 a.m to 11:30 p.m. This route includes the BMT Astoria Line in Queens and BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan to its southern terminal of Whitehall Street-South Ferry.
