{"id":55315,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole-tone_scale","text":"When a whole-tone scale is played on a piano, starting from a low note and moving up to high notes, while at the same time pressing the sustaining pedal (the right pedal), it makes a \"dreamy\" sound. It does not sound in any particular key, but floats along. It also sounds very good on a harp.\nDebussy uses the whole-tone scale a lot in his music, but he was not the first to do so. Russian composers such as Glinka in his opera \"Ruslan and Ludmila\" and Borodin in \"Prince Igor\" used the whole-tone scale.\nLater composers to use it include Alban Berg in his \"Violin Concerto\", and B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k in\nhis \"String Quartet No. 5\". It has also been used in jazz.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":39},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dreamy","offset":184},{"uri":"Harp","surface_form":"harp","offset":288},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russian","offset":383},{"uri":"Mikhail_Glinka","surface_form":"Glinka","offset":409},{"uri":"Ruslan_and_Lyudmila","surface_form":"Ruslan and Ludmila","offset":430},{"uri":"Alexander_Borodin","surface_form":"Borodin","offset":454},{"uri":"Prince_Igor","surface_form":"Prince Igor","offset":466},{"uri":"Alban_Berg","surface_form":"Alban Berg","offset":540},{"uri":"Violin_Concerto_(Berg)","surface_form":"Violin Concerto","offset":559},{"uri":"B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k","surface_form":"B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k","offset":581},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":649}]}
