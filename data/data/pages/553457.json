The anarkali suit varies in many different lengths and embroideries including floor length anarkali styles.\nAnarkali suits owe their name to the fictional Anarkali, a courtesan in the court of Mughal emperor Akbar who was legendarily murdered for her illicit relationship with the Crown Prince Salim.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anarkali","surface_form":"Anarkali","offset":402},{"uri":"Mughal_Empire","surface_form":"Mughal","offset":440},{"uri":"Akbar","surface_form":"Akbar","offset":455}]}
