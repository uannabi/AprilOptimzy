She has written music for orchestra, chamber music, vocal and choral music.\nSally studied the viola at the Royal Northern College of Music. Later she also studied in Germany and Italy.\nSally started her career playing the viola in a chamber group called the Raphael Ensemble. The experience of playing in small groups was important for her development as a composer.

Her trumpet concerto, written for H\u00E5kan Hardenberger and the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland was performed at the Proms in 2003 with Martyn Brabbins conducting.

She lives in Scotland with her husband and young daughter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":33},{"uri":"26_August","surface_form":"26 August","offset":41},{"uri":"1956","surface_form":"1956","offset":51},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":63},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":71},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":107},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber music","offset":118},{"uri":"Vocal","surface_form":"vocal","offset":133},{"uri":"Choral","surface_form":"choral","offset":143},{"uri":"Viola","surface_form":"viola","offset":175},{"uri":"Royal_Northern_College_of_Music","surface_form":"Royal Northern College of Music","offset":188},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":247},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":259},{"uri":"Viola","surface_form":"viola","offset":303},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber group","offset":314},{"uri":"BBC_Proms","surface_form":"BBC Proms","offset":646},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":661},{"uri":"Concerto","surface_form":"concerto","offset":669},{"uri":"H%C3%A5kan_Hardenberger","surface_form":"H\u00E5kan Hardenberger","offset":691},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":785},{"uri":"Flute","surface_form":"flute","offset":862},{"uri":"Viola","surface_form":"viola","offset":869},{"uri":"Saxophone","surface_form":"saxophone","offset":876},{"uri":"Percussion","surface_form":"percussion","offset":887},{"uri":"Accordion","surface_form":"accordion","offset":902},{"uri":"Viola","surface_form":"viola","offset":951},{"uri":"Saxophone","surface_form":"saxophone","offset":970},{"uri":"Quartet","surface_form":"quartet","offset":980},{"uri":"Cello","surface_form":"cello","offset":992},{"uri":"Scottish_Highlands","surface_form":"Scottish Highlands","offset":1041}]}
