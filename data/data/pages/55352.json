{"id":55352,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whigs","text":"The Whigs were a political faction and then a political party in the parliaments of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. Between the 1680s and 1850s, they contested power with their rivals, the Tories. The British prime minister was usually from one of the two parties.\nThe Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and were the enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders, who were Roman Catholic. The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715. They held it until King George III, coming to the throne in 1760, allowed Tories back in.\nWhen they held power, the Whigs purged (got rid of) the Tories from all major positions in government, the army, the Church of England, the legal profession and local officials.\nTheir most famous leader was Robert Walpole, who kept control of the government from 1721 to 1742.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":46},{"uri":"Parliaments","surface_form":"parliaments","offset":69},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":84},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":93},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":103},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":125},{"uri":"Tories","surface_form":"Tories","offset":214},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":234},{"uri":"Glorious_Revolution","surface_form":"Glorious Revolution","offset":329},{"uri":"House_of_Stuart","surface_form":"Stuart kings and pretenders","offset":386},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":424},{"uri":"King_George_III","surface_form":"King George III","offset":514},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":676},{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"Church of England","offset":702},{"uri":"Robert_Walpole","surface_form":"Robert Walpole","offset":792}]}
