It was renamed to City Hall in 1984.\nIncidents.\nOn December 10, 1985, a foreman died at City Hall MRT station.\nThis station was part of the series of 2011 MRT train disruptions on 15 and 17 December 2011. The disruption was caused by a misalignment between the trains' current collector shoes and the third rail. The disruption was one of Singapore's two largest MRT disruptions at the time of occurrence.\nA power failure and blackout occurred at the station on 6 July 2012 at about 1.30 pm, causing the platforms for north and west-bound trains to turn pitch black. Emergency lighting was turned on immediately after the incident occurred. However, train services were not affected by the incident. Lighting was progressively restored from 2 pm, and was back to normal at 3.15 pm. All escalators have also been turned on.
