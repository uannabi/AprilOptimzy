It is the longest river of the Romagna region.\nGeography.\nThe Savio river has a length of, and a drainage basin with an area of approximately.\nIts discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) depends of the season: in the autumn could be as high as 1,000 cubic metres per second but is very low during summer. Most of the time, the discharge is about 6 cubic metres per second.\nCourse.\nThe Savio river starts, with the name of \"Fosso Grosso\", in the Mount Fumaiolo, a mountain in the Apennines, at an elevation of about, in the commune of Verghereto, in the border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna regions. At its source there is monument with symbols that represent the Romagna region and the Verghereto commune.\nIn \"Montecoronaro\", a \"frazione\" (an Italian subdivision of a municipality) of Verghereto, the river takes the name of \"Savio\". The river flows through the communes of Bagno di Romagna and San Piero in Bagno and, after a few kilometres, it forms an artificial reservoir, the \"Lago di Quarto\", where it is joined, on the right side, by its first important tributary, the stream \"Para\".\nIt flows through the communes of Sarsina, Mercato Saraceno and Cesena, all in the province of Forl\u00EC-Cesena. In \"Botello\" (a \"frazione\" of Cesena), it is joined on the left side by its main tributary, the stream \"Botello\". Then it goes into the province of Ravenna and flows through \"Castiglione di Cervia\" (commune of Cervia) and \"Castiglione di Ravenna\" (commune of Ravenna).\nFinally, after 126 kilometres, it flows into the Adriatic Sea between Lido di Classe, a seaside resort, and Lido di Savio.\nMain tributaries.\nThe tributaries of the Savio are all small streams; the main are the Botello, left tributary, and Para, coming from the right.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Apennines","surface_form":"Apennines","offset":43},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":53},{"uri":"Adriatic_Sea","surface_form":"Adriatic Sea","offset":89},{"uri":"Romagna","surface_form":"Romagna","offset":134},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":200},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":250},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":261},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":271},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":325},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":333},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":354},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"autumn","offset":369},{"uri":"Cubic_metre","surface_form":"cubic metre","offset":402},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":419},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":648},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":675},{"uri":"Verghereto","surface_form":"Verghereto","offset":686},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":720},{"uri":"Emilia-Romagna","surface_form":"Emilia-Romagna","offset":732},{"uri":"Regions_of_Italy","surface_form":"regions","offset":747},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":763},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":779},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":793},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":925},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":1019},{"uri":"Bagno_di_Romagna","surface_form":"Bagno di Romagna","offset":1031},{"uri":"San_Piero_in_Bagno","surface_form":"San Piero in Bagno","offset":1052},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":1088},{"uri":"Artificial","surface_form":"artificial","offset":1112},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":1123},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1218},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":1233},{"uri":"Sarsina","surface_form":"Sarsina","offset":1281},{"uri":"Mercato_Saraceno","surface_form":"Mercato Saraceno","offset":1290},{"uri":"Cesena","surface_form":"Cesena","offset":1311},{"uri":"Province_of_Forl%C3%AC-Cesena","surface_form":"province of Forl\u00EC-Cesena","offset":1330},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":1452},{"uri":"Province_of_Ravenna","surface_form":"province of Ravenna","offset":1492},{"uri":"Cervia","surface_form":"Cervia","offset":1566},{"uri":"Ravenna","surface_form":"Ravenna","offset":1615},{"uri":"Lido_di_Classe","surface_form":"Lido di Classe","offset":1695},{"uri":"Seaside_resort","surface_form":"seaside resort","offset":1713},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":1770}]}
