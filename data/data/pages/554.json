{"id":554,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Negentropy is reverse entropy. It means things becoming more in order. By 'order' is meant organisation, structure and function: the opposite of randomness or chaos. One example of negentropy is a star system such as the Solar System. Another example is life.\nLife is considered to be negentropic because it converts things which have less order, such as food, into things with more order, such as cells in the body, tissues, and organs. In doing so, it gives off heat. Another example of negentropic things are societies, or social systems, because they take disorderly things such as communications, and make them more orderly and useful.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Entropy","surface_form":"entropy","offset":35},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":118},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":132},{"uri":"Randomness","surface_form":"randomness","offset":158},{"uri":"Chaos","surface_form":"chaos","offset":172},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":234},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":267},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"Life","offset":273},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":368},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":411},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":424},{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissues","offset":430},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":443},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":477},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"societies","offset":525},{"uri":"Systems_theory","surface_form":"systems","offset":546},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communications","offset":599}]}
