{"id":554092,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_the_Lucky_Rabbit","text":"e=\"preserve\">Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is the first animal-based character made by Disney productions. In 1927, Universal Studios hired Disney studios to make him for \"Alice Comedies\". Universal Studios owned the character by law.\nAccording to Disney, Universal Studios named him \"Oswald\" by picking the name out of a hat.\nOswald was called the lucky rabbit because of the idea of rabbits' feet being lucky. In his cartoons, Oswald would pull off his own foot, rub it for luck, and then put it back.\nOswald is drawn with big eyes, big ears and shorts like the ones Mickey Mouse wears.\nWhen Disney separated from Universal Studios, the artists there made a new character called Mickey Mouse. Meanwhile, Universal used Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in comics in 1935 and in animated programs until 1943.\nDisney bought Oswald back in 2006. Disney put him in the video game \"Epic Mickey\" in 2010 for the Nintendo Wii","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disney","surface_form":"Disney","offset":81},{"uri":"Universal_Studios","surface_form":"Universal Studios","offset":110},{"uri":"Universal_Studios","surface_form":"Universal Studios","offset":183},{"uri":"Mickey_Mouse","surface_form":"Mickey Mouse","offset":675},{"uri":"Epic_Mickey","surface_form":"Epic Mickey","offset":863},{"uri":"Nintendo_Wii","surface_form":"Nintendo Wii","offset":892}]}
