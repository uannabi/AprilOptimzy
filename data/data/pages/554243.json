They can also include (but are not limited to) small arms, ammunition, cluster munitions and land mines. There is no single definition of conventional weapons. But they are the main weapons used in modern conventional warfare.\nUN Register of Conventional Arms.\nThe United Nations set up the UN Register of Conventional Arms (UNROCA) in 1991.
