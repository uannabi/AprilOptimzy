It is described as hearing sound in the head or ears that does not come from an outside source. Many people will hear ringing, buzzing, hissing or whistling sounds, but tinnitus can be other sounds such as roaring and humming as well.\nDifferent people will hear different sounds from tinnitus but how they hear it can also be different. Tinnitus can be loud or quiet and it can be continuous or occasional and some people will not notice their tinnitus but some people become very annoyed from it, especially when then feel tired or stressed.\nTreatments and therapies.\nPeople of different range of age can develop tinnitus. It is not a disorder but the symptom of some underlying health condition.\nPeople with tinnitus may take part in yoga, exercise regularly, perform sound therapies or join a tinnitus community. Playing a faint background noise in the background also helps in keeping the phantom noise at bay.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deafness","surface_form":"hearing loss","offset":38},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":106},{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"yoga","offset":815},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercise","offset":821}]}
