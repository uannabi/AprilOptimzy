Born in Brussels the second (but oldest surviving) son of Leopold I and Louise of Orl\u00E9ans. He succeeded his father to the throne on 17 December 1865 and was king until his death.\nBiography.\nLeopold is mainly remembered as the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State. He lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He treated the people badly in order to make money. His harsh rule was responsible for the deaths of between five to 10 million Congolese people. The Congo became one of the most infamous international scandals of the early 20th century. As a result, Leopold II was forced to give control of it to the government of Belgium. Despite owning and ruling it as a dictator, Leopold II never visited the Congo Free State and Africa.\nPersonal life.\nLeopold II married Archduchess Marie Henriette of Austria, in Brussels on 22 August 1853.\nOn 15 November 1902, Italian anarchist Gennaro Rubino tried to assassinate Leopold. Rubino fired three shots at the King. The shots missed Leopold and Rubino was immediately arrested. Leopold II had a wedding ceremony with Caroline Lacroix, a prostitute, on 14 December 1909, five days before his death. This was not legal under Belgian law.\nHe was succeeded as King of the Belgians by his nephew Albert, son of his brother Philippe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Belgian_monarchs","surface_form":"King of the Belgians","offset":87},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":117},{"uri":"Leopold_I_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Leopold I","offset":167},{"uri":"Louise_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louise of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":181},{"uri":"Congo_Free_State","surface_form":"Congo Free State","offset":365},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":435},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":828},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":888},{"uri":"Archduchess_Marie_Henriette_of_Austria","surface_form":"Marie Henriette of Austria","offset":942},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":973},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":1022},{"uri":"Anarchist","surface_form":"anarchist","offset":1030},{"uri":"Gennaro_Rubino","surface_form":"Gennaro Rubino","offset":1040},{"uri":"Assassination","surface_form":"assassinate","offset":1064},{"uri":"Caroline_Lacroix","surface_form":"Caroline Lacroix","offset":1224},{"uri":"Prostitute","surface_form":"prostitute","offset":1244},{"uri":"Albert_I_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Albert","offset":1398}]}
