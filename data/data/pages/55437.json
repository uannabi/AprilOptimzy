{"id":55437,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne","text":"Carcassonne () is a fortified French town, in the \"Aude d\u00E9partement\", Occitanie region. It is separated into the fortified \"Cit\u00E9 de Carcassonne\" and the more expansive lower city, the \"ville basse\".\nThis bastide, which was thoroughly restored from 1853 by the theorist and architect Eug\u00E8ne Viollet-le-Duc, was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1997.\nHistory.\nRomans fortified the hilltop of Carcassonne around 100 BC and eventually made it the \"colonia\" of \"Julia Carsaco\", later \"Carcasum\". The main part of the lower courses of the northern ramparts dates from Gallo-Roman times.\nIn 462 the Romans officially left and the Visigothic king Theodoric II built more fortifications at Carcassonne, some of them still stand. In 760, Pippin was unable to take Carcassonne, although he was able to most of the south of France.\nIn 1067 Carcassonne became the property of Raimond Bernard Trencavel, viscount of Albi and N\u00EEmes. Carcassonne became famous in its role in the Albigensian Crusades, when the city was a stronghold of occitan cathars. In August 1209 the crusading army of Simon de Montfort forced its citizens to surrender. He added to the fortifications. Carcassonne became a border citadel between France and Aragon.\nGeography.\nCarcassonne is at about southeast of Toulouse in the space between the Pyrenees and the Massif Central of France. It is at the crossing of two major traffic routes: the route leading from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and that from the Massif Central to Spain, skirting the Pyrenees. Both routes exist since ancient history.\nThe \"commune\" is in the valley of the Aude river. Another river that flows through the city is the Fresquel river. The Canal du Midi also flows through the \"commune\".\nThe \"commune\" of Carcassonne has an area of, and its average altitude is; at the city hall, the altitude is.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Carcassonne, in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification, is Cfb - oceanic climate with warm summers.\nPopulation.\nThe inhabitants of Carcassonne are known, in French, as \"Carcassonnais\" (women: \"Carcassonnaises \").\nWith a population of 45,941, Carcassonne has a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nEvolution of the population in Carcassonne\nCarcassonne forms, with other 2 \"communes\", the urban area of Carcassonne with a population of 49,257 inhabitants (2013) and an area of. This urban area is the centre of the metropolitan area of Carcassonne, formed by 71 \"communes\" with a population of 98,318 inhabitants (2013) and an area of.\nEducation.\nA campus of the \u00C9cole nationale de l'aviation civile (French civil aviation academy) is in Carcassonne.\nAdministration.\nIt is part of the intercommunality \"Carcassonne Agglo\" ().\nThe fortified city.\nThe fortifications consist of a double ring of ramparts and 53 towers. In 1849, the architect Eug\u00E8ne Viollet-le-Duc took over restoration works.\nAt his death in 1879 his pupil Paul Boeswillwald, and later the architect Nodet continued the rehabilitation of Carcassonne. The restoration was strongly criticized during Viollet-le-Duc's lifetime because he made the error of using slates and restoring the roofs as pointed cones, where local practice was traditionally of tile roofing and low slopes, as in this region snow was very seldom. But today Viollet-le-Duc's work at Carcassonne is thought to be a work of genius, even if it is not exactly the same as it was.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["French commune"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Defensive_wall","surface_form":"fortified","offset":20},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":30},{"uri":"Aude","surface_form":"Aude d\u00E9partement","offset":51},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":70},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":80},{"uri":"Bastide","surface_form":"bastide","offset":204},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":323},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":338},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":377},{"uri":"Anno_Domini","surface_form":"BC","offset":432},{"uri":"Colonia","surface_form":"colonia","offset":463},{"uri":"Defensive_wall","surface_form":"ramparts","offset":561},{"uri":"Gallo-Roman_culture","surface_form":"Gallo-Roman","offset":581},{"uri":"Visigoths","surface_form":"Visigothic","offset":642},{"uri":"Theodoric_II","surface_form":"Theodoric II","offset":658},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortification","offset":682},{"uri":"Viscount","surface_form":"viscount","offset":909},{"uri":"Albi","surface_form":"Albi","offset":921},{"uri":"N%C3%AEmes","surface_form":"N\u00EEmes","offset":930},{"uri":"Albigensian_Crusade","surface_form":"Albigensian Crusade","offset":982},{"uri":"Stronghold","surface_form":"stronghold","offset":1024},{"uri":"Simon_de_Montfort%2C_5th_Earl_of_Leicester","surface_form":"Simon de Montfort","offset":1092},{"uri":"Aragon","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":1231},{"uri":"Toulouse","surface_form":"Toulouse","offset":1287},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":1321},{"uri":"Massif_Central","surface_form":"Massif Central","offset":1338},{"uri":"Atlantic","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":1442},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":1458},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient history","offset":1562},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":1603},{"uri":"Aude_(river)","surface_form":"Aude","offset":1617},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1622},{"uri":"Fresquel","surface_form":"Fresquel","offset":1678},{"uri":"Canal_du_Midi","surface_form":"Canal du Midi","offset":1698},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":1807},{"uri":"City_and_town_halls","surface_form":"city hall","offset":1827},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":1899},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":1939},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":2031},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"population density","offset":2134},{"uri":"Urban_area","surface_form":"urban area","offset":2264},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":2390},{"uri":"%C3%89cole_nationale_de_l%27aviation_civile","surface_form":"\u00C9cole nationale de l'aviation civile","offset":2538},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"intercommunality","offset":2660}]}
