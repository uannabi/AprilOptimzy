{"id":554525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War_Corps_Badges","text":"Corps badges in the American Civil War were originally worn by soldiers of the Union Army on the top of their army forage cap, left side of the hat, or over their left chest pocket. The idea was suggested by Major Geneneral Philip Kearny. During a battle he reprimanded officers that turned out to not be under his command. To prevent that from happening again, he ordered the men in his division to sew a square of red cloth on their hats. This idea was adopted by Major General Joseph Hooker after he assumed command of the Army of the Potomac. This was so any soldier could be identified at a distance.\nCorps badges.\nThese were used in the United States' Army of the Potomac. These rules were adopted by other Union Armies, however it was not universal. For example, the XIII Corps never adopted a badge. Also, the XIX Corps had the first division wear a red badge, the second division wear a blue badge, and the third division wear white.\nThe badges for enlisted men were cut from colored cloth. Officer's badges were privately made and of a higher quality. Metallic badges were often made by jewelers and were personalized for the user. The badges eventually became part of the Army regulations and a great source of regimental pride.\nXIX XX XXI XXII XXIII XXIV XXV Cavalry corps\nXIII Corps, Army of the Tennessee.\nNo badge was designated for the XIII Corps.\nBrigade badges.\nI Corps, Army of the Potomac","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Corps","surface_form":"Corps","offset":0},{"uri":"Badge","surface_form":"badge","offset":6},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":20},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":63},{"uri":"Union_Army","surface_form":"Union Army","offset":79},{"uri":"Forage_cap","surface_form":"forage cap","offset":115},{"uri":"Hat","surface_form":"hat","offset":144},{"uri":"Chest","surface_form":"chest","offset":168},{"uri":"Pocket","surface_form":"pocket","offset":174},{"uri":"Major_Geneneral","surface_form":"Major Geneneral","offset":208},{"uri":"Philip_Kearny","surface_form":"Philip Kearny","offset":224},{"uri":"Reprimand","surface_form":"reprimand","offset":258},{"uri":"Division","surface_form":"division","offset":388},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":416},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":420},{"uri":"Joseph_Hooker","surface_form":"Joseph Hooker","offset":480},{"uri":"Army_of_the_Potomac","surface_form":"Army of the Potomac","offset":526},{"uri":"Army_of_the_Potomac","surface_form":"Army of the Potomac","offset":658},{"uri":"Military_service","surface_form":"enlisted men","offset":958},{"uri":"Jeweler","surface_form":"jeweler","offset":1097},{"uri":"Regulation","surface_form":"regulation","offset":1188},{"uri":"Pride","surface_form":"pride","offset":1233},{"uri":"XIII_Corps_(ACW)","surface_form":"XIII Corps","offset":1352}]}
