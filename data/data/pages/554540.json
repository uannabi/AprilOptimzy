{"id":554540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1917","text":"=\"preserve\">The Immigration Act of 1917 (also called the Literacy Act and the Asiatic Barred Zone Act) was a United States law to stop certain types of people from moving to the US to live. It was the first law to try and restrict immigration, rather than try to control it. People wanting to immigrate had to pass literacy tests. The law also created new categories of people who would not be allowed to immigrate. People from much of Asia were prevented from immigrating.\nThe Immigration Act of 1924 made more restrictions. The laws stayed in place until changed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (the McCarran\u2013Walter Act).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":109},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":231},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":315},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":436},{"uri":"Immigration_Act_of_1924","surface_form":"Immigration Act of 1924","offset":478},{"uri":"Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1952","surface_form":"Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952","offset":572}]}
