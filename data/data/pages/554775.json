He became known for his role in Pontiac's War (1763\u20131766), an American Indian war against British military near the Great Lakes region and named for him. \u00A0Historians today generally view him as an important local leader who influenced a wider movement that he did not command.\nThe war began in May 1763 when Pontiac and 300 followers attempted to take Fort Detroit by surprise but their plan was foiled.\nHe gained confidence as he continued to go against the British. British officials made Pontiac the focus of their diplomatic efforts seeking to end the war.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"War_chief","surface_form":"war chief","offset":53},{"uri":"Pontiac%27s_War","surface_form":"Pontiac's War","offset":96},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":180},{"uri":"Fort_Detroit","surface_form":"Fort Detroit","offset":416},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomatic","offset":582}]}
