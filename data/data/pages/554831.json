{"id":554831,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_crops","text":"e=\"preserve\">Rabi crops are grown in\u00A0the winter\u00A0and harvested in the spring in the\u00A0South Asia. The word means spring in the Arabic language.\nOverview.\nIt is also called rabi harvest and spring harvest (also known as winter crop). The rabi crops are sown around mid-November, after the\u00A0monsoon\u00A0rains are over, and harvesting begins in April/May. The crops are grown either with rainwater that has\u00A0percolated\u00A0into the ground, or with\u00A0irrigation. A good rain in winter spoils the\u00A0rabi crop\u00A0but is good for kharif crops.\nNormally wheat barley,\u00A0mustard,\u00A0sesame\u00A0and\u00A0peas are grown in india.\u00A0Peas are harvested early, as they are ready early: Indian markets are flooded with green peas from January to March, peaking in February.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":41},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":83},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic language","offset":124},{"uri":"Monsoon","surface_form":"monsoon","offset":285},{"uri":"Percolation","surface_form":"percolated","offset":396},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigation","offset":432},{"uri":"Kharif_crops","surface_form":"kharif crops","offset":503},{"uri":"Barley","surface_form":"barley","offset":532},{"uri":"Mustard_seed","surface_form":"mustard","offset":540},{"uri":"Sesame","surface_form":"sesame","offset":549},{"uri":"Peas","surface_form":"peas","offset":560}]}
