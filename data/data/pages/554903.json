It is located south of Tupungato, one of the highest mountains in the Americas, and about southeast of Santiago.\nHistory.\nThe first ascent of this peak was made on 19 January 1833 by Paul G\u00FCssfeldt, a German geologist, mountaineer and explorer, together with two Chilean guides: Lorenzo Zamorano and Francisco (only the first name is known).\nGeography.\nIn Chile, the Maipo volcano is in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, Cordillera province, San Jos\u00E9 de Maipo commune. In Argentina, it is in the Mendoza province, San Carlos department, Pareditas district.\nThe Maipo river starts on the western side (Chile) of the volcan. The Diamante river start on the eastern side (Argentina) in the lake with the same name.\nThe volcano was formed during the Pleistocene. There are four historical and confirmed records of eruptions of the Maipo: in 1826, 1829,1905 and 1912. The \"Laguna del Diamante\" (\"Diamond Lake\") was formed by the eruption of 1826.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stratovolcano","surface_form":"stratovolcano","offset":11},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":32},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":67},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":81},{"uri":"Tupungato","surface_form":"Tupungato","offset":111},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":141},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":158},{"uri":"Santiago%2C_Chile","surface_form":"Santiago","offset":191},{"uri":"Mountain_climbing","surface_form":"ascent","offset":220},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":289},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geologist","offset":296},{"uri":"Mountaineering","surface_form":"mountaineer","offset":307},{"uri":"Exploration","surface_form":"explorer","offset":323},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":351},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":444},{"uri":"Santiago_Metropolitan_Region","surface_form":"Santiago Metropolitan Region","offset":479},{"uri":"Cordillera_Province%2C_Chile","surface_form":"Cordillera","offset":509},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":520},{"uri":"San_Jos%C3%A9_de_Maipo","surface_form":"San Jos\u00E9 de Maipo","offset":530},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":548},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":560},{"uri":"Mendoza_Province","surface_form":"Mendoza","offset":584},{"uri":"San_Carlos_Department%2C_Mendoza","surface_form":"San Carlos","offset":602},{"uri":"Departments_of_Argentina","surface_form":"department","offset":613},{"uri":"Pareditas","surface_form":"Pareditas","offset":625},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":635},{"uri":"Maipo_(river)","surface_form":"Maipo","offset":649},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":655},{"uri":"Diamante_(river)","surface_form":"Diamante","offset":715},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":834},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":862},{"uri":"Record","surface_form":"records","offset":887},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruptions","offset":898}]}
