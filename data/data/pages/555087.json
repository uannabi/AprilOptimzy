{"id":555087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitechapel","text":"Whitechapel\u00A0is a district in the\u00A0East End of London, in the\u00A0London Borough of Tower Hamlets.\nIt is 3.4 miles (5.5\u00A0km) east of\u00A0Charing Cross\u00A0and roughly bounded by\u00A0Petticoat Lane\u00A0and\u00A0Mansell Street\u00A0to the west, Fashion Street to the north, Cambridge Heath Road and Sidney Street to the east and\u00A0The Highway\u00A0to the south.\nBecause the area is close to the\u00A0London Docklands\u00A0and east of the city, it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class. The area was the centre of the London Jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century. It is where the infamous\u00A0Whitechapel Murders\u00A0by\u00A0Jack the Ripper\u00A0took place in 1888. In the latter half of the 20th century, Tower Hamlets (including Whitechapel) became the largest settlement for the\u00A0British Bangladeshi\u00A0community, particularly on and around\u00A0Whitechapel Road\u00A0and\u00A0Brick Lane.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"East_End_of_London","surface_form":"East End of London","offset":33},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets","surface_form":"London Borough of Tower Hamlets","offset":60},{"uri":"Charing_Cross","surface_form":"Charing Cross","offset":126},{"uri":"Petticoat_Lane","surface_form":"Petticoat Lane","offset":163},{"uri":"Sidney_Street","surface_form":"Sidney Street","offset":264},{"uri":"The_Highway","surface_form":"The Highway","offset":294},{"uri":"London_Docklands","surface_form":"London Docklands","offset":353},{"uri":"Immigrant","surface_form":"immigrant","offset":424},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":443},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":496},{"uri":"Whitechapel_murders","surface_form":"Whitechapel Murders","offset":574},{"uri":"Jack_the_Ripper","surface_form":"Jack the Ripper","offset":597},{"uri":"Bangladeshi","surface_form":"Bangladeshi","offset":757},{"uri":"Whitechapel_Road","surface_form":"Whitechapel Road","offset":807},{"uri":"Brick_Lane","surface_form":"Brick Lane","offset":828}]}
