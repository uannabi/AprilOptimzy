Simintov had lived with the second last remaining Jewish man in Afghanistan, Ishaq Levin, who died on January 26, 2005, aged around 80.\nSimintov says it is not easy to practice his religion alone. However, he has obtained special permission from the nearest rabbi, in\u00A0Tashkent,\u00A0Uzbekistan, to slaughter his own meat in line with\u00A0\"kosher\"\u00A0dietary laws. That can normally only be done by a specially trained and qualified Jewish\u00A0ritual slaughterer. He says that he receives special kosher packages for\u00A0Passover\u00A0from Afghan Jews living in\u00A0New York.\nHis wife and two daughters live in\u00A0Israel. When asked during an interview whether he would emigrate to Israel, Simintov retorted, \"Go to Israel? What business do I have there? Why should I leave?\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":54},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":61},{"uri":"Herat","surface_form":"Herat","offset":89},{"uri":"Orthodox_Judaism","surface_form":"his religion","offset":273},{"uri":"Rabbi","surface_form":"rabbi","offset":354},{"uri":"Tashkent","surface_form":"Tashkent","offset":364},{"uri":"Uzbekistan","surface_form":"Uzbekistan","offset":374},{"uri":"Kosher","surface_form":"kosher","offset":426},{"uri":"Ritual_slaughterer","surface_form":"ritual slaughterer","offset":523},{"uri":"Passover","surface_form":"Passover","offset":596},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York","offset":632},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":677}]}
