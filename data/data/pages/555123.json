{"id":555123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hyperacusis is a hearing health problem where people become more sensitive to some sounds for certain frequencies and volumes. This can make everyday sounds such as a car, dishwasher or refrigerator sound very loud. It is usually very difficult to tolerate and can be uncomfortable or even painful for people experiencing it.\nSymptoms.\nThe increasing sensitivity of the ears caused by hyperacusis is usually painful for many people. Not only can it negatively effect the everyday lives of people experiencing it, it can for some make it very difficult and even not possible to do their everyday jobs and take care of their responsibilities. There are many symptoms experienced by those with hyperacusis.\nCauses.\nSimilarly to other hearing problems, hyperacusis can occur suddenly or gradually over time and is a problem that can affect people of all different ages in one or both ears. Again, like other forms of hearing problems, there are a variety of possible causes ranging from exposure to noise and other diseases.\nAlthough these are the main causes of hyeracusis and can be seen as causes related to most hearing problems, there are other less common, possible causes such as post-traumatic stress disorder.\nTreatment.\nHyperacusis cannot always be fully cured, but for most patients the symptoms get better with time and treatment. Patients will need to learn to use hearing protection against sounds which are very loud, but to not use these in everyday situations. Protecting the ears too much will make the symptoms worse instead of better.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequencies","offset":115}]}
