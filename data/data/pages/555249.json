At Pievepelago (in the Modena province), its name changes to \"Scoltenna\".

South of Modena, in \"Ponte Guerro\", it is joined by the \"Guerro\" stream and in \"Fossalta\", a place to the east of Modena, it is joined, as a left tributary, by the \"Tiepido\" stream, its main tributary.\nAt Bomporto, the river joins the \"Naviglio de Modena\" (\"Modena canal or waterway\") and can be navigated until its confluence with the Po, on the border with the Veneto region and to the west of Ferrara.\nThe Panaro river flows through the cities of Vignola, Finale Emilia and Bondeno and just to the east of Modena.\nOf historical and artistic interest is the bridge of Olina (), built in 1522 across the river (still called Scoltenna) near the town of the same name, in the commune of Pavullo nel Frignano\nMain tributaries.\nThe tributaries of the Panaro river are small streams; the most importants are the Guerro () and the Tiepido (); they join the Panaro from the left side.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":19},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":41},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":73},{"uri":"Po_(river)","surface_form":"Po","offset":90},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":93},{"uri":"Apennines","surface_form":"Apennines","offset":126},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":136},{"uri":"Emilia-Romagna","surface_form":"Emilia-Romagna","offset":173},{"uri":"Regions_of_Italy","surface_form":"region","offset":188},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":247},{"uri":"Apennines","surface_form":"Apennines","offset":378},{"uri":"Tuscany","surface_form":"Tuscany","offset":415},{"uri":"Monte_Cimone","surface_form":"Monte Cimone","offset":468},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":527},{"uri":"Pievepelago","surface_form":"Pievepelago","offset":538},{"uri":"Province_of_Modena","surface_form":"Modena","offset":558},{"uri":"Confluence","surface_form":"confluence","offset":658},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":699},{"uri":"Pavullo_nel_Frignano","surface_form":"Pavullo nel Frignano","offset":735},{"uri":"Modena","surface_form":"Modena","offset":906},{"uri":"Modena","surface_form":"Modena","offset":1011},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1043},{"uri":"Bomporto","surface_form":"Bomporto","offset":1102},{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"canal","offset":1162},{"uri":"Waterway","surface_form":"waterway","offset":1171},{"uri":"Navigate","surface_form":"navigated","offset":1193},{"uri":"Veneto","surface_form":"Veneto","offset":1260},{"uri":"Ferrara","surface_form":"Ferrara","offset":1293},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":1337},{"uri":"Vignola","surface_form":"Vignola","offset":1347},{"uri":"Finale_Emilia","surface_form":"Finale Emilia","offset":1356},{"uri":"Bondeno","surface_form":"Bondeno","offset":1374},{"uri":"Historical","surface_form":"historical","offset":1417},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":1432},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":1457},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":1542},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":1572},{"uri":"Pavullo_nel_Frignano","surface_form":"Pavullo nel Frignano","offset":1583},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":1626}]}
