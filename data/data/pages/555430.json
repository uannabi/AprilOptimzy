{"id":555430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_trioxide","text":"Uranium trioxide (UO3), also called uranyl oxide, uranium(VI) oxide, and uranic oxide, is an oxide of uranium. UO3 is a hexavalent oxide, which means that the uranium in the compound has an oxidation state of +6. It can be formed by heating uranyl nitrate to 400\u00A0\u00B0C.\nUO3 is a poisonous and slightly radioactive substance. It can be harmful if it is breathed in, ingested, or makes contact with skin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranyl","surface_form":"uranyl","offset":36},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":93},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"uranium","offset":102},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":190},{"uri":"Uranyl_nitrate","surface_form":"uranyl nitrate","offset":241},{"uri":"Radioactive","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":299}]}
