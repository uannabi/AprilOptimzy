They often rely on digital distribution, some indie games have become very successful like Minecraft.\nOverview.\nIndie game has no true definition, but has certain features, they are often made by one person or a small team, often smaller than mainstream titles, often not getting money from a publisher. But being without a publisher means that they have no-one telling them what they can and can't do, giving them much more freedom to make a game they want to make. But making a Indie game does not mean they have no publisher. Indie game developers often go to crowd-funding sites to help fund the game, but often make very little profit.\nHistory.\nIndie games started on PCs where it currently remains.
