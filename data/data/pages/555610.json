He served as a U.S. Representative from the state of Illinois. During his three terms, he was the only African American serving in Congress.\nDe Priest proposed a law barring discrimination in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC was program of the New Deal to employ people across the country in building infrastructure. His proposal was made a law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nIn 1929, De Priest made national news. First Lady Lou Hoover invited his wife, Jessie, to a traditional tea for congressional wives at the White House. In reaction several newspapers published a racist poem called \"Niggers in the White House\". The poem was first published when Booker T.
