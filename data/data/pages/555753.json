He was an important officer in the Communist military junta that governed Ethiopia from 1974 to 1987. He was President of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia from 1987 to 1991.\nMariam was a dictator. It is estimated that he was responsible for 500,000 to over 2,000,000 deaths. In May 1991 Mariam left the country for Zimbabwe. The Ethiopian Civil War ended when he left.\nIn 2010, Mengistu announced the publication of its memoirs. In early 2012, a manuscript of the memoir, titled Tiglachin (\"Our Struggle\" in Amharic), was leaked on the Internet. A few months later, the first volume leaked was published in the United States and in 2016, the second volume followed. This time it was published in Ethiopia. Mengistu accused the ERP remains of having published the first volume to sabotage its publication.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":28},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"Communist","offset":85},{"uri":"Military_junta","surface_form":"military junta","offset":95},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":124},{"uri":"People%27s_Democratic_Republic_of_Ethiopia","surface_form":"People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia","offset":176},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":249},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":377},{"uri":"Ethiopian_Civil_War","surface_form":"Ethiopian Civil War","offset":391}]}
