{"id":55579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas","text":"\"Cycas\" is a genus of plants. It is the only genus currently known in the Cycadaceae family. Over 100 species are known.\nProbably the best-known of these is marketed as Sago Palm or King Sago Palm. The plant is not a true palm, however. The generic name comes from Greek \"kykas\" and means \"palm tree\".\n\"Cycas\" is native to the Old World; most species are around the equatorial regions. It is native to eastern and southeastern Asia including the Philippines with 6 species (4 of which are endemic), eastern Africa (including Madagascar), northern Australia, Polynesia, and Micronesia. Australia has 26 species, while the Indo-Chinese area has about 30. The northernmost species (\"C. revoluta\") is found at 31\u00B0N in southern Japan. The southernmost (\"C. megacarpa\") is found at 26\u00B0S in southeast Queensland, Australia.\nThe plants have often been considered to be a living fossil. The earliest fossils of the genus \"Cycas\" appear in the Cainozoic, but \"Cycas\"-like fossils occur well into the Mesozoic. \"Cycas\" is not closely related to other genera of cycads. Phylogenetic studies have shown that Cycadaceae is the sister-group to all other living cycads.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus_(biology)","surface_form":"genus","offset":13},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":22},{"uri":"Cycadaceae","surface_form":"Cycadaceae","offset":74},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":102},{"uri":"Sago_Palm","surface_form":"Sago Palm","offset":169},{"uri":"Palm_tree","surface_form":"palm","offset":222},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":265},{"uri":"Old_World","surface_form":"Old World","offset":327},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":366},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":427},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":446},{"uri":"Endemic","surface_form":"endemic","offset":489},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":507},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":525},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":547},{"uri":"Polynesia","surface_form":"Polynesia","offset":558},{"uri":"Micronesia","surface_form":"Micronesia","offset":573},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":723},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":794},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":806},{"uri":"Living_fossil","surface_form":"living fossil","offset":863},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":891},{"uri":"Cainozoic","surface_form":"Cainozoic","offset":934},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":990},{"uri":"Phylogeny","surface_form":"Phylogenetic","offset":1058}]}
