{"id":55614,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are a type of two dimensional picture that work on vectors, rather than pixels. This means that they can be easily be made bigger or smaller without losing any quality or becoming blurry. SVG is based on XML and created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\nHistory.\nThe W3C published SVG in September 2001. As of 2018 SVG is widely supported in all modern browsers.\nThe normal Filename extension is \".svg\" and the MIME-Type is codice_2.\nStructure.\nSVG uses Extensible Markup Language (XML). So it has a definition of the document type.\nDifference between bitmap and vector images.\nThis image shows the difference between bitmap and vector\nimages. The vector image can be scaled forever, while the bitmap can not.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vectors","surface_form":"vectors","offset":95},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pixel","offset":116},{"uri":"XML","surface_form":"XML","offset":248},{"uri":"World_Wide_Web_Consortium","surface_form":"World Wide Web Consortium","offset":271},{"uri":"Filename_extension","surface_form":"Filename extension","offset":424},{"uri":"MIME-Type","surface_form":"MIME-Type","offset":461}]}
