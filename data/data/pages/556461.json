{"id":556461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO","text":"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a large-scale physics observatory which detects cosmic gravitational waves co-founded by Scottish physicist Ronald Drever. They were first funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and were conceived, built and are operated by Caltech and MIT.\nThe NSF has funded improvements for LIGO to increase sensitivity, which allowed them to make the first detection of gravitational waves. LIGO is the largest and most ambitious project ever funded by the NSF.\nLIGO is an interferometer. It fires a laser beam and splits it into two laser beams. Mirrors bounce them back towards a light detector and merge them. Normally, the two laser beams should cancel each other, so the light does not reach the detector, but any changes in space-time caused by gravity wave<nowiki/>s can change the laser beams, so that they don't cancel out fully. When this happens, the light detector will see some of the laser light, which it can then use to work out the size of the space-time distortion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":80},{"uri":"Observatory","surface_form":"observatory","offset":88},{"uri":"Detect","surface_form":"detect","offset":106},{"uri":"Cosmos","surface_form":"cosmic","offset":114},{"uri":"Gravitational_wave","surface_form":"gravitational wave","offset":121},{"uri":"Ronald_Drever","surface_form":"Ronald Drever","offset":174},{"uri":"Fund","surface_form":"fund","offset":205},{"uri":"National_Science_Foundation","surface_form":"National Science Foundation","offset":219},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"conceived","offset":262},{"uri":"Built","surface_form":"built","offset":273},{"uri":"Operate","surface_form":"operate","offset":287},{"uri":"Caltech","surface_form":"Caltech","offset":299},{"uri":"MIT","surface_form":"MIT","offset":311},{"uri":"Improvement","surface_form":"improvement","offset":335},{"uri":"Sensitivity_(electronics)","surface_form":"sensitivity","offset":369},{"uri":"Ambitious","surface_form":"ambitious","offset":482},{"uri":"Interferometer","surface_form":"interferometer","offset":535},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser beam","offset":562},{"uri":"Space-time","surface_form":"space-time","offset":792},{"uri":"Gravity_wave","surface_form":"gravity wave","offset":813}]}
