He is generally regarded as one of the greatest poets in Polish literature.\nBiography.\nJan Kochanowski was born into a noble family in the village of Sycyna, Poland. His parents were\nPiotr Kochanowski, a lawyer and judge, and Anna Bia\u0142aczowska. Among their 11 children, two of Jan's brothers were also writers. He studied at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. Then he attended the University of K\u00F6nigsberg (Kr\u00F3lewiec), in Ducal Prussia, and Padua University in Italy. He returned to Poland in 1559. In 1563 he became a secretary at the royal court of Sigismund II Augustus. He married Dorota Podlodowska around 1575 and settled at the family estate at Czarnolas (\"Blackwood\"). Kochanowski is sometimes called \"Jan z Czarnolasu\" (\"John of Blackwood\"). He died of a heart attack in 1584 in the town of Lublin.\nWorks.\nJan Kochanowski wrote in Polish and Latin. He wrote \"Fraszki\", a cycle of epigrams, \"Pie\u015Bni\" (\"Cantos\") and \"Treny\" (\"Laments\"). The last work was written by the poet after death of his daughter Ursula. He lost another daughter, named Hanna, too. Kochanowski wrote also \"Pie\u015B\u0144 \u015Bwi\u0119toja\u0144ska o Sob\u00F3tce\" (\"Midsummer Night's Song\") and \"Odprawa po\u0142\u00F3w greckich\" (\"The Dismissal of the Grecian Envoys\"). Many of his poems are free translations from Horace. Kochanowski translated \"The Book of Psalms\" and \"Chess\" by Marco Girolamo Vida. Kochanowski established rules of Polish versification and introduced sonnet to Polish poetry. Many poems by Kochanowski were translated into English.\nThe translator Piotr Kochanowski was Jan Kochanowski's nephew.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish","offset":34},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":41},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":53},{"uri":"Translator","surface_form":"translator","offset":59},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":74},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":150},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"noble","offset":205},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":225},{"uri":"Sycyna","surface_form":"Sycyna","offset":236},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":290},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":301},{"uri":"Jagiellonian_University","surface_form":"Jagiellonian University","offset":415},{"uri":"Cracow","surface_form":"Cracow","offset":442},{"uri":"University_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg","surface_form":"University of K\u00F6nigsberg","offset":471},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Ducal Prussia","offset":512},{"uri":"University_of_Padua","surface_form":"Padua University","offset":531},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":551},{"uri":"Royal_court","surface_form":"royal court","offset":626},{"uri":"Sigismund_II_Augustus","surface_form":"Sigismund II Augustus","offset":641},{"uri":"Settle","surface_form":"settle","offset":710},{"uri":"Estate","surface_form":"estate","offset":732},{"uri":"Czarnolas","surface_form":"Czarnolas","offset":742},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":854},{"uri":"Lublin","surface_form":"Lublin","offset":890},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":930},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":941},{"uri":"Epigram","surface_form":"epigram","offset":979},{"uri":"Horace","surface_form":"Horace","offset":1348},{"uri":"Marco_Girolamo_Vida","surface_form":"Marco Girolamo Vida","offset":1415},{"uri":"Sonnet","surface_form":"sonnet","offset":1505},{"uri":"Piotr_Kochanowski","surface_form":"Piotr Kochanowski","offset":1601}]}
