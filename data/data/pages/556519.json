{"id":556519,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria","text":"The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, happened on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo. They were shot dead by Gavrilo Princip.\nPrincip was one of a group of seven assassins (five from Serbia and one from Bosnia). The leader was Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Black Hand secret society. The political reason for the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a new country, Yugoslavia.\nThis led to the outbreak of war in Europe at the end of July 1914. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Both country's allies became involved in the war.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Assassination","surface_form":"assassination","offset":4},{"uri":"Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria","surface_form":"Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria","offset":21},{"uri":"Heir_presumptive","surface_form":"heir presumptive","offset":58},{"uri":"Throne","surface_form":"throne","offset":82},{"uri":"Austria-Hungary","surface_form":"Austria-Hungary","offset":92},{"uri":"Sophie%2C_Duchess_of_Hohenberg","surface_form":"Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg","offset":122},{"uri":"Sarajevo","surface_form":"Sarajevo","offset":180},{"uri":"Gavrilo_Princip","surface_form":"Gavrilo Princip","offset":213},{"uri":"Gavrilo_Princip","surface_form":"Gavrilo Princip","offset":331},{"uri":"Black_Hand","surface_form":"Black Hand","offset":364},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":480},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":536}]}
