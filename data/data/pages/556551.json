{"id":556551,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec_figurine","text":"Olmec figurine is the name for figurines which were produced in Central America, from about 1000 BCE to about 500 BCE. Many come from the Olmec heartland, which is the gulf region of modern-day Mexico. Olmec figurines show the influence of the Olmec culture. In 2016, it is not known how far this influence extended. It is therefore possible that some of these figurines were produced by other people, who were influenced by the Olmec.\nMany of the figurines were found in household waste and in landfill used for construction. Outside the Olmec heartland they were also found in graves. Looters often took these figurines. It is impossible to tell where the looted figurines are from.\nMost of the figurines are made from terracotta. Since terracotta is fragile, most only survive in parts. Wooden busts have been discovered in the submerged site El Marati, but no figurines made of wood have been found.\nThe figurines best known to the public are made of stone or minerals,such as jade, serpentine, greenstone or basalt. Figurines of stone or minerals are often carved, while those made of terracotta are simpler in design.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Figurine","surface_form":"figurine","offset":31},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":64},{"uri":"Common_Era","surface_form":"BCE","offset":97},{"uri":"Olmec_heartland","surface_form":"Olmec heartland","offset":138},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":194},{"uri":"Olmec","surface_form":"Olmec","offset":244},{"uri":"Waste","surface_form":"waste","offset":482},{"uri":"Landfill","surface_form":"landfill","offset":495},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":513},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":579},{"uri":"Looter","surface_form":"Looters","offset":587},{"uri":"Terracotta","surface_form":"terracotta","offset":721},{"uri":"Bust","surface_form":"bust","offset":797},{"uri":"Submerge","surface_form":"submerged","offset":831},{"uri":"El_Marati","surface_form":"El Marati","offset":846},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":964},{"uri":"Jadeite","surface_form":"jade","offset":981},{"uri":"Serpentine_group","surface_form":"serpentine","offset":987},{"uri":"Greenstone_(archaeology)","surface_form":"greenstone","offset":999},{"uri":"Basalt","surface_form":"basalt","offset":1013}]}
