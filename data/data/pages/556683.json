Many contain 1000\u00A0mg per serving, and some as much as 2000\u00A0mg.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":14},{"uri":"Bile","surface_form":"bile","offset":106},{"uri":"Skeletal_muscle","surface_form":"skeletal muscles","offset":152},{"uri":"Retina","surface_form":"retina","offset":174},{"uri":"Nerve","surface_form":"nerves","offset":190},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":225},{"uri":"Cysteine","surface_form":"cysteine","offset":236},{"uri":"Bull","surface_form":"bull","offset":296},{"uri":"Ox","surface_form":"ox","offset":339}]}
