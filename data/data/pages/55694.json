{"id":55694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed","text":"The Nicene Creed, Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed or Icon/Symbol of the Faith, is the most widespread or ecumenical Christian statement of faith.\nSince its original formulation it continues to be used in the Roman Catholic, Syrian Orthodox (Jacobite), Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Anglican, Lutheran, and most other Protestant Churches.\nComparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381.\nThe following table displays side by side the earlier (325) and later (381) forms of this Creed in the English translation given in Schaff's [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.iv.iii.html Creeds of Christendom,] which indicates by brackets the portions of the 325 text that were omitted or moved in 381, but uses no typographical mark to indicate what phrases, absent in the 325 text, were added in 381.\nThe following table presents in the same way the texts of the two Councils, as given in the original Greek language on the Web site [http://www.creeds.net/ancient/niceneg.htm Symbolum Nicaeno-Constantinopolitanum - Greek:]\nProblems.\nThere were certain problems with the Nicene creed. In 529, the so-called filioque clause was added to the creed. This clause is one of the main differences between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Catholic Church has this clause, the Eastern Orthodox Church does not. The clause is about how godly the Father is, compared to the Son. Where the original Nicene Creed reads \"We believe in the Holy Spirit... who proceeds from the Father\", the altered, Roman Catholic version reads \"We believe in the Holy Spirit... who proceeds from the Father \"and the Son\". Roman Catholic Christians accept this change, but Eastern Orthodox Christians reject it. Many Eastern Catholic churches (Eastern in liturgy but in full communion with the pope) do not use the clause in their creed. They do think the doctrine it represents is true, though, as this is a dogma of the Roman Catholic faith. Many Protestant churches who take a position in this matter, usually accept the \"filioque\".\nAfter the East-West Schism of 1054, the Eastern and Western churches attempted to reunite at two separate medieval councils, and the filioque was an issue at each. Despite Greek concessions, neither the Second Council of Lyon (1274) nor the Council of Ferrera-Florence (1438 - 1535) achieved the desired union.\nThe clause is most often referred to as \"the \"filioque\" or simply \"filioque\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ecumenism","surface_form":"ecumenical","offset":105},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":116},{"uri":"Creed","surface_form":"statement of faith","offset":126},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":208},{"uri":"Syrian_Orthodox","surface_form":"Syrian Orthodox","offset":224},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox","offset":252},{"uri":"Oriental_Orthodoxy","surface_form":"Oriental Orthodox","offset":270},{"uri":"Assyrian_Church_of_the_East","surface_form":"Assyrian","offset":289},{"uri":"Anglican","surface_form":"Anglican","offset":299},{"uri":"Lutheranism","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":309},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":334},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek language","offset":916},{"uri":"Filioque_clause","surface_form":"filioque clause","offset":1121},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":1216},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox Church","offset":1246},{"uri":"Eastern_Catholic","surface_form":"Eastern Catholic","offset":1729},{"uri":"East-West_Schism","surface_form":"East-West Schism","offset":2058},{"uri":"Second_Council_of_Lyon","surface_form":"Second Council of Lyon","offset":2251},{"uri":"Council_of_Florence","surface_form":"Council of Ferrera-Florence","offset":2289}]}
