{"id":557337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_ordinal_numbers","text":"e=\"preserve\">Here are some words for small ordinal numbers. Words in bold are irregular.\nWhen writing other numbers between 21 and 99, only use the cardinal form of the last number. Also, you must use a hyphen (-).\nThe ordinal number 100 is written as \"one hundredth\", but sometimes people say \"the hundredth\".\nYou can also write ordinal numbers by writing the number, then the ending (-st, -nd, -rd, or -th) from above.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":27},{"uri":"Ordinal_number","surface_form":"ordinal number","offset":43}]}
