The position was created by the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nThe Acting President possesses all Presidential powers and duties during the time of their term but does not become the President, instead serving only as Acting President. This term lasts until the President declares in writing that they are no longer unable to execute the duties of their office themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_(United_States)","surface_form":"President","offset":91},{"uri":"Amendment","surface_form":"Amendment","offset":217},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":234}]}
