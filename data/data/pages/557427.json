She was the first woman to be elected to the\u00A0Australian House of Representatives\u00A0and the first woman in the\u00A0federal Cabinet. She was the wife of the\u00A0Premier of Tasmania\u00A0and later\u00A0Prime Minister of Australia,\u00A0Joseph Lyons.\nLyons was born\u00A0Enid Muriel Burnell\u00A0in\u00A0Smithton, Tasmania, one of three daughters of William and Eliza (n\u00E9e Taggett) Burnell. She trained to be a teacher in Hobart. Her mother was active in the Labor party and community groups in Tasmania. She was one of the first women appointed as a\u00A0Justice of the Peace\u00A0in Tasmania.\nLyons was made a\u00A0Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire\u00A0(GBE) in the\u00A0Coronation Honours\u00A0of 1937.<a href=\"Enid_Lyons%23cite_note-naaw-4\">a></a><a href=\"Enid_Lyons%23cite_note-5\">a></a>\u00A0Joseph Lyons died in 1939, aged 59, the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office, and Dame Enid returned to Tasmania. She bitterly resented Joseph Lyons's successor as leader of the UAP,\u00A0Robert Menzies, who had, she believed, betrayed her husband by resigning from the Cabinet, shortly before Joseph's death.<a href=\"Enid_Lyons%23cite_note-adbprofile-1\">a></a>\nAt the\u00A01943 election\u00A0Dame Enid Lyons narrowly won the\u00A0Division of Darwin\u00A0in north-western Tasmania for the UAP, becoming the first woman in the House of Representatives. Her Labor opponent, who received more primary votes than she did, was the future Tasmanian Premier\u00A0Eric Reece. At the same election,\u00A0Dorothy Tangney\u00A0was elected as a Labor Senator for Western Australia, the nation's first woman Senator.\nIn retirement, Dame Enid's health recovered. She was a newspaper columnist (1951\u201354), a commissioner of the\u00A0Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u00A0(1951\u201362), and remained active in public life promoting family and women's issues. She published three volumes of memoirs, which embarrassed the Liberal Party by reviving her complaints about Menzies' 1939 behaviour towards her husband.<a href=\"Enid_Lyons%23cite_note-adbprofile-1\">a></a>\nShe was nevertheless made a\u00A0Dame of the Order of Australia\u00A0(AD) on Australia Day 1980,<a href=\"Enid_Lyons%23cite_note-8\">a></a>\u00A0the second woman to receive this honour.
