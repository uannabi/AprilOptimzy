It is named after the ancient Greek woman poet Sappho.\nThe stanza consists of four lines. Three of them are composed of eleven syllables and the last one is made up of five syllables. In Greek verse the quantity of syllables was important. That is, whether the syllables are long or short. In other languages it is no longer significant.\nSapphic stanza was adopted by Roman poets, for example by Horace. His popularity helped in expanding the use of the stanza. It became common in many literatures. The Sapphic stanza was extremely popular in Polish poetry from the 16th century. In English however, is not used often. Among poets who experimented with it was Algernon Charles Swinburne.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":90},{"uri":"Sappho","surface_form":"Sappho","offset":151},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":231},{"uri":"Horace","surface_form":"Horace","offset":500}]}
