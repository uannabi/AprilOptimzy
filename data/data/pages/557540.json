While not the first USRS cutter to be launched, it was the first to enter active service.\nHistory.\n\"Massachusetts\" was built at Newburyport, MA by shipwright William Searle. She was designed as a schooner. She was rigged with fore-and-aft sails on two masts.\nOn July 15, 1791 \"Massachusetts\" was launched. John Foster Williams was its first master. Her crew consisted of four officers, four enlisted men and two cabin boys. She was long by wide and had a shallow draft of only. Williams ordered an increase in her size without getting approval by the service. This increased her cost over what was originally budgeted. But the government accepted the \"Massachusetts\" as changed by Williams.\nShe had the shortest service life of any of the original ten cutters. The first \"Massachusetts\" turned out to be too expensive to operate and was too slow. On 9 October 1792 she was sold. In 1793 she was replaced by a smaller lighter sloop, the \"Massachusetts II\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cutter","surface_form":"cutter","offset":49},{"uri":"United_States_Revenue_Cutter_Service","surface_form":"United States Revenue Cutter Service","offset":79},{"uri":"Launch","surface_form":"launch","offset":155},{"uri":"Active_duty","surface_form":"active service","offset":191},{"uri":"Newburyport%2C_MA","surface_form":"Newburyport, MA","offset":245},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":299},{"uri":"Schooner","surface_form":"schooner","offset":313},{"uri":"Fore-and-aft_rig","surface_form":"fore-and-aft","offset":343},{"uri":"Mast_(sailing)","surface_form":"mast","offset":369},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":493},{"uri":"Enlisted_rank","surface_form":"enlisted men","offset":508},{"uri":"Cabin_boy","surface_form":"cabin boy","offset":529},{"uri":"Draft","surface_form":"draft","offset":580},{"uri":"Budget","surface_form":"budget","offset":726},{"uri":"Expense","surface_form":"expensive","offset":925},{"uri":"Sloop","surface_form":"sloop","offset":1042}]}
