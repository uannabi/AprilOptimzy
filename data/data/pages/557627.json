{"id":557627,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stove_fan","text":"Stove fans are small fans that are usually set on top of a wood-burning stove, although they can be put on top of anything warm, like an oven. A stove will slowly radiate heat into the surrounding room, but it can take a long time for this to warm up a room. A fan will make air move past the stove and into the room, which will make the room warm up much faster. (This type of heat is called \"convection.\")\nAlthough any kind of fan can help warm move air around a room, this type of stove fan is placed directly on the top of the stove. You don't plug it in, and it doesn't have any batteries. Instead, the heat from the stove itself causes the fan to move.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
