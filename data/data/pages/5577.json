{"id":5577,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Saint-Denis","text":"The Basilica of Saint Denis is a basilica near Paris, France. It is famous for its architecture and as the burial place for many Kings of France. It is in the suburb of Saint Denis, which is in the north of Paris. Since 1966, it is the cathedral of the diocese of Saint-Denis. It is located in the Greater Paris area, about from Paris.\nThe Basilica is named after Saint Denis. Saint Denis is the patron saint of France. He was also the first Bishop of Paris.\nThe Basilica was a Romanesque building. In 1136 the Abbot Suger (1081 - 1155) began replacing the building, bit by bit, beginning with the west front and then with a new east end. The east end is said to be the first building in the Gothic style. It was not completed until the 13th century.\nThe current organ of the basilica is the first organ built by Aristide Cavaille-Coll. With 4200 pipes, it contains a lot of innovations, opening the romantic area. The French organist Pierre Pincemaille, titular between 1987 and 2018, set up lots of recitals and recorded 8 CDs with this instrument.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Basilica","surface_form":"basilica","offset":33},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":47},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":54},{"uri":"Burial","surface_form":"burial","offset":107},{"uri":"King_of_France","surface_form":"Kings of France","offset":129},{"uri":"Saint_Denis","surface_form":"Saint Denis","offset":169},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":236},{"uri":"Diocese","surface_form":"diocese","offset":253},{"uri":"Saint-Denis","surface_form":"Saint-Denis","offset":264},{"uri":"Basilica","surface_form":"Basilica","offset":340},{"uri":"Patron_saint","surface_form":"patron saint","offset":396},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Paris","surface_form":"Bishop of Paris","offset":442},{"uri":"Romanesque_architecture","surface_form":"Romanesque","offset":478},{"uri":"Abbot_Suger","surface_form":"Abbot Suger","offset":511},{"uri":"Gothic_architecture","surface_form":"Gothic","offset":692},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":737},{"uri":"Pipe","surface_form":"organ","offset":763},{"uri":"Aristide_Cavaille-Coll","surface_form":"Aristide Cavaille-Coll","offset":813},{"uri":"Pierre_Pincemaille","surface_form":"Pierre Pincemaille","offset":935}]}
