{"id":558360,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson%2C_Nebraska","text":"e=\"preserve\">Jackson is a village in Dakota County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 223 at the 2010 census.\nHistory.\nBefore Jackson was formed, the town Old St. John's was started about 1.5 miles north of where Jackson is on June 2nd, 1856 by a Catholic colony of sixty Irish immigrants led by Father Trecy. The colony was one of the first towns started in Dakota County, and the first group of Catholic people to start a town together in Nebraska. When the rising Missouri River\u00A0started to make it dangerous to live there around 1860, all of the residents of Old St. John's moved south to what is now called Jackson.\nJackson was originally called Franklin, and was started with that name around 1860.\u00A0The people who lived in there later found out that there was already a place in Nebraska that was called Franklin. To make things less confusing, they renamed the town after\u00A0Andrew Jackson\u00A0so nobody would get confused. St. Patrick's Catholic Church, which is in Jackson, is where the\u00A0Nebraska State Historical Society\u00A0put historical\u00A0marker 34. The historical St. Patrick's Catholic church was built on land that was given to the church by the McCormick family around the time Jackson was started.\nLocation.\nJackson can be found at (42.448789, -96.566207).\nThe\u00A0United States Census Bureau\u00A0says that\u00A0the village takes up about\u00A0, of land.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dakota_County%2C_Nebraska","surface_form":"Dakota County, Nebraska","offset":37},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":62},{"uri":"United_States_Census%2C_2010","surface_form":"2010 census","offset":107},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":257},{"uri":"Missouri_River","surface_form":"Missouri River","offset":477},{"uri":"Andrew_Jackson","surface_form":"Andrew Jackson","offset":888},{"uri":"United_States_Census_Bureau","surface_form":"United States Census Bureau","offset":1274}]}
