{"id":55855,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine","text":"=\"preserve\">Alternative medicine describes practices used in place of conventional medical treatments. Some patients seek these practices along with conventional medicine. When the patient's medical doctor coordinates with an alternative medicine therapist, this is called \"complementary medicine.\"\nAlternative medicine includes practices that incorporate spiritual, metaphysical, or religious belief; non-evidence based practices, non-European medical traditions, or newly developed approaches to healing.\nExamples include acupuncture, chiropractic and homeopathy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":162},{"uri":"Spiritual","surface_form":"spiritual","offset":356},{"uri":"Metaphysical","surface_form":"metaphysical","offset":367},{"uri":"Acupuncture","surface_form":"acupuncture","offset":524},{"uri":"Chiropractic","surface_form":"chiropractic","offset":537},{"uri":"Homeopathy","surface_form":"homeopathy","offset":554}]}
