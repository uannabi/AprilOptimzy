{"id":558599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ard%C3%A8che_(river)","text":"The Ard\u00E8che () is a long river in south-central France, a right-bank tributary of the River Rh\u00F4ne. The river gives its name to the French department of Ard\u00E8che.\nGeography.\nThe Ard\u00E8che river has a length of and a drainage basin with an area of approximately.\nIts average yearly discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 64.8 cubic metres per second at Saint-Martin-d'Ard\u00E8che in the Gard department.\nCourse.\nThe Ard\u00E8che river starts in the Massif Central, within the \"Parc naturel r\u00E9gional des Monts d'Ard\u00E8che\" (\"Regional nature park Mountains of Ard\u00E8che\"), in the \"commune\" of Astet (Ard\u00E8che department), at an elevation of about.\nIt then flows roughly to the southwest and, after the towns of Aubenas and Ruoms, it gets into its famous gorge (or canyon) below Vallon-Pont-d\u2019Arc.\nThe valley of the Ard\u00E8che is very scenic, in particular a section known as the Ard\u00E8che Gorges (or the Canyon of Ard\u00E8che). The walls of the river here are limestone cliffs up to high. A kayak and camping trip down the gorge is not technically difficult and is very popular in the summer. The most famous feature is a natural stone arch across the river known as the Pont d'Arc.\nFinally, the river flows into the Rh\u00F4ne river, on the right side, near the \"commune\" Pont-Saint-Esprit, Gard department.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":25},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":48},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":69},{"uri":"Rh%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Rh\u00F4ne","offset":92},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":138},{"uri":"Ard%C3%A8che","surface_form":"Ard\u00E8che","offset":152},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":212},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":277},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":288},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":298},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":352},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":360},{"uri":"Cubic_metre","surface_form":"cubic metre","offset":374},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":391},{"uri":"Saint-Martin-d%27Ard%C3%A8che","surface_form":"Saint-Martin-d'Ard\u00E8che","offset":401},{"uri":"Gard","surface_form":"Gard","offset":431},{"uri":"Massif_Central","surface_form":"Massif Central","offset":488},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":614},{"uri":"Astet","surface_form":"Astet","offset":626},{"uri":"Ard%C3%A8che","surface_form":"Ard\u00E8che","offset":633},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":660},{"uri":"Aubenas","surface_form":"Aubenas","offset":743},{"uri":"Ruoms","surface_form":"Ruoms","offset":755},{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":786},{"uri":"Canyon","surface_form":"canyon","offset":796},{"uri":"Vallon-Pont-d%27Arc","surface_form":"Vallon-Pont-d\u2019Arc","offset":810},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":983},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":993},{"uri":"Kayak","surface_form":"kayak","offset":1014},{"uri":"Camping","surface_form":"camping","offset":1024},{"uri":"Canyon","surface_form":"gorge","offset":1046},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":1153},{"uri":"Arch","surface_form":"arch","offset":1159},{"uri":"Rh%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Rh\u00F4ne","offset":1240},{"uri":"Pont-Saint-Esprit","surface_form":"Pont-Saint-Esprit","offset":1291},{"uri":"Gard","surface_form":"Gard","offset":1310}]}
