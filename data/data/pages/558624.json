{"id":558624,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circinus_galaxy","text":"The Circinus galaxy (ESO 97-G13) is a Seyfert galaxy, very bright and emitting huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation.\nCircinus is in a constellation of the same name, Circinus (constellation). It is one of the closest and nearest galaxies to the Milky Way. It is probably slightly further away than Centaurus A.\nThe galaxy just 4 degrees below the galactic plane and 13 million light years from our galaxy. Its outer ring is 700 light years from the galaxy's centre, and the inner ring just 130 light years from the centre. You can see the galaxy with a small telescope.\nThe galaxy was not noticed until 1977 because it lies close to the plane of the Milky Way and is obscured by galactic dust.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seyfert_galaxy","surface_form":"Seyfert galaxy","offset":38},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_radiation","surface_form":"electromagnetic radiation","offset":95},{"uri":"Circinus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Circinus (constellation)","offset":171},{"uri":"List_of_nearest_galaxies","surface_form":"nearest","offset":226},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":250},{"uri":"Centaurus_A","surface_form":"Centaurus A","offset":303},{"uri":"Galactic_plane","surface_form":"galactic plane","offset":352},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light year","offset":382},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":403},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light year","offset":433},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":642}]}
