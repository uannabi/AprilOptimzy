{"id":558656,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium(II)_nitrate","text":"=\"preserve\">Palladium(II) nitrate is the inorganic compound with the formula Pd(NO3)2. It is a red-brown solid with a tendency to absorb water.\nPreparation.\nPalladium nitrate may be prepared by dissolving palladium oxide hydrate in dilute nitric acid, followed by crystallization. The nitrate crystallizes as yellow-brown deliquescent prisms. The compound also may be got by treating palladium metal with nitric acid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Inorganic_compound","surface_form":"inorganic compound","offset":41},{"uri":"Palladium_oxide","surface_form":"palladium oxide","offset":205},{"uri":"Crystallization","surface_form":"crystallization","offset":264},{"uri":"Deliquescent","surface_form":"deliquescent","offset":322},{"uri":"Prism","surface_form":"prism","offset":335},{"uri":"Palladium","surface_form":"palladium","offset":384},{"uri":"Nitric_acid","surface_form":"nitric acid","offset":405}]}
