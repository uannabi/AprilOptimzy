{"id":558664,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americium_dioxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Americium dioxide is a black compound of Americium. As a solid, AmO2 has the same structure as fluorite (CaF2).\nUses.\nAmericium-Aluminium alloys are formed by the melting of americium dioxide with aluminium and a fluxing agent. These alloys can be used to produce atoms of elements having a higher atomic number than Uranium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americium","surface_form":"Americium","offset":53},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":94},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":209},{"uri":"Flux_(metallurgy)","surface_form":"fluxing agent","offset":225},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":276},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"elements","offset":285},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":310},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"Uranium","offset":329}]}
