{"id":558769,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trough","text":"=\"preserve\">A parabolic trough is similar to a solar panel tower, because it has parabolic mirrors that collect large amounts of heat which is reflected on water-filled pipes.\nThe water is heated until it turns into steam, rotating a turbine using a large steam piston.\nThe rotating turbine produces electricity, which is then transferred by transformer, before being converted DC to AC and transferred by current lines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solar_panel","surface_form":"solar panel","offset":47},{"uri":"Parabolic_mirror","surface_form":"parabolic mirror","offset":81},{"uri":"Steam","surface_form":"steam","offset":216},{"uri":"Turbine","surface_form":"turbine","offset":234},{"uri":"Piston","surface_form":"piston","offset":262},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":300},{"uri":"Transformer","surface_form":"transformer","offset":342}]}
