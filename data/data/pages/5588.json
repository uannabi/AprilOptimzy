{"id":5588,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset","text":"Somerset is a county in South West England.\nThe main town of Somerset was Somerton, but it is now Taunton. There are two cities in Somerset. They are Bath and Wells.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Somerset\" comes from the Anglo-Saxon phrase \"Sumorsaete,\" which was used to describe people from Somerton.\nIn the past, the northern border of Somerset was the River Avon. However, as the city of Bristol has grown, the border moved south.\nIn 1974 parts of north Somerset, the city of Bristol and parts of south Gloucestershire were joined into a new county. This county was named Avon. In 1996 Avon was split into 4 parts, which are now unitary authorities. People usually say that 2 of these parts (named North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset) are part of Somerset, even though they have their own councils.\nThe oldest prison in England which is still used is in a town named Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Somerset also has the world's oldest road which people built. It is called the Sweet Track; it was built in about 3800 BC.\nIndustry and tourism.\nThere is not much large industry in Somerset, but Bridgwater is a port, and Yeovil is important in building helicopters.\nFarming is an important industry in Somerset, but not as many people work in this industry today. Somerset is famous for its cider (an alcoholic apple drink) and it has many apple orchards.\nDistricts of Somerset.\nThe numbers on the map are linked to the numbers below.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":14},{"uri":"South_West_England","surface_form":"South West England","offset":24},{"uri":"Somerton","surface_form":"Somerton","offset":74},{"uri":"Taunton","surface_form":"Taunton","offset":98},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":121},{"uri":"Bath_(city)","surface_form":"Bath","offset":150},{"uri":"Wells","surface_form":"Wells","offset":159},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":210},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":309},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":318},{"uri":"River_Avon","surface_form":"River Avon","offset":345},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":381},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":417},{"uri":"1974","surface_form":"1974","offset":427},{"uri":"Gloucestershire","surface_form":"Gloucestershire","offset":496},{"uri":"Avon_(county)","surface_form":"Avon","offset":565},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":574},{"uri":"Unitary_authority","surface_form":"unitary authorities","offset":622},{"uri":"North_Somerset","surface_form":"North Somerset","offset":691},{"uri":"Bath_and_North_East_Somerset","surface_form":"Bath and North East Somerset","offset":710},{"uri":"Council","surface_form":"council","offset":794},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":815},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":825},{"uri":"Shepton_Mallet","surface_form":"Shepton Mallet","offset":872},{"uri":"Sweet_Track","surface_form":"Sweet Track","offset":979},{"uri":"3800_BC","surface_form":"3800 BC","offset":1014},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":1069},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":1111},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":1153},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"Farming","offset":1166},{"uri":"Cider","surface_form":"cider","offset":1291},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":1301},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":1311},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":1340},{"uri":"Grove_(nature)","surface_form":"orchard","offset":1346}]}
