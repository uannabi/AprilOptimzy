{"id":5589,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury","text":"Glastonbury is a town in Somerset, England. It is well known for the Glastonbury Festival which happens every year in Glastonbury.\nGlastonbury is also well-known because of Glastonbury Abbey. This is because Glastonbury Abbey is said to be the place where King Arthur is buried, and it was burned down when King Henry the Eighth got angry at all Catholic monasteries in the country as the Pope would not grant him a divorce. The abbot, Abbot Whiting, was killed on the Tor, a local landmark.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":17},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":25},{"uri":"Glastonbury_Festival","surface_form":"Glastonbury Festival","offset":69},{"uri":"Glastonbury_Abbey","surface_form":"Glastonbury Abbey","offset":173},{"uri":"King_Arthur","surface_form":"King Arthur","offset":256},{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Pope","offset":389}]}
