Gaga collaborated with RedOne on the song \"Angel Down\", which was written about Trayvon Martin, who was killed in 2012. RedOne also helped produce Gaga's previous blockbuster hits, such as \"Just Dance\", \"Poker Face\", and \"Bad Romance\". Country songwriter Hillary Lindsey also worked with Gaga on \"Joanne\" on songs like \"Million Reasons\". Singer-songwriter Beck worked with Gaga on the dance song \"Dancin' in Circles\".\nTwo singles were released for the album: \"Perfect Illusion\" and \"Million Reasons\". The first single reached the top 20 in several countries, like the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK. \"Million Reasons\" first peaked at number 52 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. However, after her Super Bowl halftime performance on February 5, 2017, the song entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 again at number four. This is Gaga's 14th top-ten song and her 10th song to reach the top five on the chart.\nGaga went on a Dive Bar Tour at three different dive bars in the United States to promote \"Joanne\".\nCritics have said that \"Joanne\" is different from Gaga's previous releases, such as \"The Fame\", \"The Fame Monster\", \"Born This Way\", and \"Artpop\".
