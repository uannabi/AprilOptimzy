{"id":559031,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary","text":"A catenary is a type of curve. An ideal chain hanging between two supports and acted on by a uniform gravitational force makes the shape of a catenary. (An ideal chain is one that can bend perfectly, cannot be stretched and has the same density throughout.) The supports can be at different heights and the shape will still be a catenary. A catenary looks a bit like a parabola, but they are different.\nThe equation for a catenary in Cartesian coordinates is\nwhere formula_1 is a parameter that determines the shape of the catenary and is the hyperbolic cosine function, which is defined as\nHence, we can also write the catenary equation as\nThe word \"catenary\" comes from the Latin word \"catena\", which means \"chain\". A catenary is also called called an alysoid and a chainette.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":24},{"uri":"Chain","surface_form":"chain","offset":40},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravitational force","offset":101},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":237},{"uri":"Parabola","surface_form":"parabola","offset":369},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":407},{"uri":"Cartesian_coordinate_system","surface_form":"Cartesian coordinates","offset":434},{"uri":"Parameter","surface_form":"parameter","offset":480},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_function","surface_form":"hyperbolic cosine","offset":543},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":676}]}
