{"id":5594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street","text":"A street is a piece of land, made flat and often with pavement, so that people can travel on it better. \"Street\" and \"road\" may mean the same thing, but \"street\" is more often used only in a town.\nMany streets are the center of local culture or of a specialized activity. New Orleans\u2019 Bourbon Street, for example, is famous for its active nightlife and also for its role as the center of the city\u2019s French Quarter. The Bowery in Manhattan was, at different times, a main highway, a center of underground punk culture, and a specialized shopping district for light fixtures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pavement","surface_form":"pavement","offset":54},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":118},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":272},{"uri":"Bourbon_Street","surface_form":"Bourbon Street","offset":285},{"uri":"French_Quarter","surface_form":"French Quarter","offset":399},{"uri":"Bowery","surface_form":"Bowery","offset":419},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":429},{"uri":"Punk","surface_form":"punk","offset":504}]}
