{"id":559458,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollough_effect","text":"The McCollough effect is a phenomenon of human vision: Colorless gratings appear colored contingent on the orientation of the gratings. People need time to see the effect. For example, if someone looks at a red horizontal grating and then at a green vertical grating for a few minutes, a black-and-white horizontal grating will look greenish and a black-and-white vertical grating will then look pinkish. The effect is remarkable for often lasting up to three months or more.\nThe effect was discovered by American psychologist Celeste McCollough in 1965.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grating","surface_form":"grating","offset":65},{"uri":"Contingent_perceptual_aftereffect","surface_form":"contingent","offset":89},{"uri":"Orientation_(geometry)","surface_form":"orientation","offset":107},{"uri":"Celeste_McCollough","surface_form":"Celeste McCollough","offset":527}]}
