{"id":55949,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine","text":"A turbine is an engine that turns fluid movement into energy.\nSimple turbines have a shaft with a blade on it. Moving fluids, such as water or air, push the blades so that they turn around with the shaft. The turning movement is most often used to turn a generator. Early turbine examples are windmills and water wheels. Turbine blades can also be turned to move a fluid. This is how simple propeller airplanes work.\nA casing can be placed around the turbine to control the movement of the fluid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":16},{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":34},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":54},{"uri":"Shaft","surface_form":"shaft","offset":85},{"uri":"Blade","surface_form":"blade","offset":98},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":134},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":143},{"uri":"Move","surface_form":"move","offset":217},{"uri":"Generator","surface_form":"generator","offset":255},{"uri":"Windmill","surface_form":"windmill","offset":293},{"uri":"Water_wheel","surface_form":"water wheel","offset":307},{"uri":"Propeller","surface_form":"propeller","offset":391},{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":401},{"uri":"Casing","surface_form":"casing","offset":419},{"uri":"Control","surface_form":"control","offset":462}]}
