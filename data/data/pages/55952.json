{"id":55952,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power","text":"Electric power is defined as the power dissipated by an electric circuit. Electric power is a measurement of the rate at which energy is used over a period of time. The SI unit for power is the watt, the unit for energy is the joule, and the unit for time is the second.\nFor a direct current circuit, electric power equals the electric current multiplied by the voltage.\nWhen electric current flows through a circuit, it is slowed down by the resistance in the circuit. Devices can convert this current to useful forms of work, such as heat radiation, light emission, mechanical motion, or acoustic vibrations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":169},{"uri":"Watt","surface_form":"watt","offset":194},{"uri":"Joule","surface_form":"joule","offset":227},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"direct current","offset":277},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":327},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":362},{"uri":"Electrical_resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":443},{"uri":"Work_(physics)","surface_form":"work","offset":522},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":536},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":552},{"uri":"Kinetic_energy","surface_form":"mechanical motion","offset":568},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"acoustic","offset":590}]}
