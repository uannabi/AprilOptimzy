The league's 30 teams changed from six divisions to four divisions. The regular season began October 1 and ended April 13. The 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs began April 16. For the first time since 1973, only one Canadian team made the playoffs: the Montreal Canadiens.\nThere was no all-star game this season, due to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Prior to the season, the NHL, International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and Olympic officials reached an agreement to send NHL players to the Olympics game. The league took a break on February 9 and resumed play on February 25.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_NHL_seasons","surface_form":"97th","offset":31},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":85},{"uri":"2014_Stanley_Cup_playoffs","surface_form":"2014 Stanley Cup playoffs","offset":273},{"uri":"Montreal_Canadiens","surface_form":"Montreal Canadiens","offset":392},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League_All-Star_Game","surface_form":"all-star game","offset":425},{"uri":"2014_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"2014 Winter Olympics","offset":463},{"uri":"Sochi","surface_form":"Sochi","offset":487},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":494},{"uri":"International_Ice_Hockey_Federation","surface_form":"International Ice Hockey Federation","offset":532}]}
