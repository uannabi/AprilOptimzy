{"id":559855,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_image","text":"=\"preserve\">In optics, a virtual image is an image formed when the outgoing rays from an object always diverge (move apart). A plane mirror forms a virtual image positioned behind the mirror. Light from the source only exists in front of the mirror. The image in a plane mirror appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.\nIn contrast, a real image is one that is formed when the outgoing rays form a point converge at a real location. Real images can be projected onto a diffuse reflecting screen, but a screen is not necessary for the image to form.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Optics","surface_form":"optics","offset":15},{"uri":"Ray_(optics)","surface_form":"rays","offset":76},{"uri":"Diverge","surface_form":"diverge","offset":103},{"uri":"Mirror","surface_form":"mirror","offset":133},{"uri":"Real_image","surface_form":"real image","offset":373},{"uri":"Screen","surface_form":"screen","offset":526}]}
