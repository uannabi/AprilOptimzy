{"id":559875,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Marxism\u2013Leninism was practiced by the Soviet Union (USSR) after the Bolshevik Revolution. It was also practiced by the Stalinists in the USSR.\nThe purpose of Marxism\u2013Leninism is to turn a capitalist state into a socialist state. This is done by a revolution by the proletariat to overthrow the old government. The new government then creates a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\". This new government leads the country based on democratic centralism.\nThe communist party is supposed to lead society from capitalism to socialism. According to ML, socialism was more \"advanced\" than capitalism, but communism was more \"advanced\" than socialism. Indeed, the ultimate goal is to achieve a communist society, one with no class or state. ML just provides a first step: from capitalism to socialism.\nToday, the only remaining countries who are adherents of Marxism-Leninism are: China, Cuba, Vietnam, and Laos, with North Korea moving to its own political philosophy, Juche, though the ideology was also influenced by Marxism-Leninism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":51},{"uri":"Bolshevik_Revolution","surface_form":"Bolshevik Revolution","offset":81},{"uri":"Stalinism","surface_form":"Stalinists","offset":132},{"uri":"Capitalism","surface_form":"capitalist","offset":201},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialist","offset":225},{"uri":"Proletariat","surface_form":"proletariat","offset":278},{"uri":"Democratic_Centralism","surface_form":"democratic centralism","offset":439},{"uri":"Communist_party","surface_form":"communist party","offset":466},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":883},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":890},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":896},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":909},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":920},{"uri":"Juche","surface_form":"Juche","offset":972}]}
