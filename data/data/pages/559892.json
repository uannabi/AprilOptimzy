{"id":559892,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming","text":"Dairy farming is a type of agriculture that is focused on producing milk. This is different from raising animals to produce meat. Milk can be used to produce dairy product<nowiki/>s, including cheese. Species commonly used are cows (so-called dairy cows), but goats, sheep and camels are also used. Sometimes donkeys are used to produce an alternative to cows' milk for babies. Some babies can digest donkeys' milk better than cows' milk.\nProducing milk has been part of farming since prehistoric times. In the 20th century, farmers have become more specialized. Some farmers started with farms that only produce milk.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":68},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":105},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":124},{"uri":"Dairy_product","surface_form":"dairy product","offset":158},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":193},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":227},{"uri":"Goat","surface_form":"goat","offset":260},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":267},{"uri":"Camel","surface_form":"camel","offset":277},{"uri":"Donkey","surface_form":"donkey","offset":309},{"uri":"Babies","surface_form":"babies","offset":370},{"uri":"Digest","surface_form":"digest","offset":394}]}
