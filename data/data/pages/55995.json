{"id":55995,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Van","text":"The Turkish Van is a breed of cat that comes from Turkey. It has lived in the Lake Van area of Turkey for hundreds of years. This is why it is named the Turkish Van. This part of Turkey is in very high mountains and has long, cold winters. But the summers are hot.\nThis cat got used to this climate over time by its body changing. It now has a thick, full fur coat in the winter, but sheds in the summer and becomes a short-haired cat. The Turkish Van swims in the summer to cool itself off and the thin summer coat dries quickly.\nEye colous.\nA Turkish Van may have blue eyes, amber eyes, or eyes with two different colors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cat_breed","surface_form":"breed","offset":21},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":50},{"uri":"Lake_Van","surface_form":"Lake Van","offset":78},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":291},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":356},{"uri":"Moulting","surface_form":"sheds","offset":384}]}
