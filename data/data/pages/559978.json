{"id":559978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_cuisine","text":"Nouvelle cuisine (French, \"new cuisine\") is an approach to cooking and food presentation in French cuisine. In contrast to the older haute cuisine, nouvelle cuisine has lighter, more delicate dishes, and pretty presentation. It started in Paris in the 1970s, and by the 1980s was seen in London and New York. The movement is now almost worldwide.\nThe reasons are connected with modern business life, where long two-hour lunches are a thing of the past. Also, customers began to look for lighter food menus. Food critics Henri Gault and his colleagues Andr\u00E9 Gayot and Christian Millau put out a new restaurant guide, the \"Gault-Millau\", or \"Le Nouveau Guide\".\nHistory.\nHowever, the term \"nouvelle cuisine\" has been used several times in the history of French cuisine.\nIn the 1730s and 1740s, several French writers emphasized their break with tradition. They called their cooking \"modern\" or \"new\". In 1742 Menon introduced the term \"nouvelle cuisine\" as the title of the third volume of his \"Nouveau trait\u00E9\". Fran\u00E7ois Marin worked in the same tradition.\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, the cooking of Georges Auguste Escoffier was sometimes described as \"nouvelle cuisine\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":18},{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French cuisine","offset":92},{"uri":"Haute_cuisine","surface_form":"haute cuisine","offset":133},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":239},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":288},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":299},{"uri":"Lunch","surface_form":"lunch","offset":420},{"uri":"Menus","surface_form":"menus","offset":500},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Marin","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois Marin","offset":1009},{"uri":"Georges_Auguste_Escoffier","surface_form":"Georges Auguste Escoffier","offset":1093}]}
