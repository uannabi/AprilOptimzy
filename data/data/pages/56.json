It is in Eastern Europe on the Armenian Highlands,\nArmenia is bordered by Turkey to the west and Georgia to the north. The \"de facto\" independent Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan is to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.\nArmenia is a multi-party, democratic nation-state.\nHistory.\nIt has an ancient cultural heritage. Urartu was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. The Kingdom of Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the Great in the 1st century BC and became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301.\nForeign invasion.\nBetween the 16th century and 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of the Ottoman and Iranian empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule.\n20th century.\nDuring World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, all non-Russian countries declared their independence after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into full Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nAdministrative divisions.\nArmenia is divided into ten provinces, with the city of Yerevan having special administrative status as the country's capital. The chief executive in each of the ten provinces is the \"marzpet\" (\"marz\" governor), appointed by the government of Armenia. In Yerevan, the chief executive is the mayor, appointed by the president.\n, Armenia includes 915 communities, of which 49 are considered urban and 866 are considered rural.\n\u2020 2011 censusSources: Area and population of provinces.\nCulture.\nThe Republic of Armenia recognises the Armenian Apostolic Church, the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment. The unique Armenian alphabet was invented by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD.\nArmenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Council of Europe and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Armenia supports the de facto independent Republic of Artsakh, which was proclaimed in 1991.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":55},{"uri":"South_Caucasus","surface_form":"South Caucasus","offset":70},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":95},{"uri":"Armenian_Highlands","surface_form":"Armenian Highlands","offset":135},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":178},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":201},{"uri":"Republic_of_Artsakh","surface_form":"Republic of Artsakh","offset":250},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":274},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":305},{"uri":"Exclave","surface_form":"exclave","offset":327},{"uri":"Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic","surface_form":"Nakhchivan","offset":338},{"uri":"Nation_state","surface_form":"nation-state","offset":400},{"uri":"Urartu","surface_form":"Urartu","offset":460},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":490},{"uri":"Satrapy_of_Armenia","surface_form":"Satrapy of Armenia","offset":542},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Armenia_(antiquity)","surface_form":"Kingdom of Armenia","offset":566},{"uri":"Tigranes_the_Great","surface_form":"Tigranes the Great","offset":610},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":700},{"uri":"State_religion","surface_form":"official religion","offset":720},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":869},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":886},{"uri":"Eastern_Armenia","surface_form":"Eastern Armenia","offset":946},{"uri":"Western_Armenia","surface_form":"Western Armenia","offset":966},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman","offset":1009},{"uri":"Persian_Empire","surface_form":"Iranian","offset":1021},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":1159},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1294},{"uri":"Armenian_Genocide","surface_form":"Armenian Genocide","offset":1411},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":1433},{"uri":"Russian_Revolution","surface_form":"Russian Revolution","offset":1453},{"uri":"First_Republic_of_Armenia","surface_form":"First Republic of Armenia","offset":1605},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":1635},{"uri":"Transcaucasian_Socialist_Federative_Soviet_Republic","surface_form":"Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic","offset":1677},{"uri":"1922","surface_form":"1922","offset":1737},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1774},{"uri":"1936","surface_form":"1936","offset":1791},{"uri":"Armenian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic","offset":1888},{"uri":"Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Union republics","offset":1934},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":2004},{"uri":"Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"dissolution of the Soviet Union","offset":2020},{"uri":"Yerevan","surface_form":"Yerevan","offset":2135},{"uri":"Armenian_Apostolic_Church","surface_form":"Armenian Apostolic Church","offset":2608},{"uri":"Armenian_alphabet","surface_form":"Armenian alphabet","offset":2732},{"uri":"Mesrop_Mashtots","surface_form":"Mesrop Mashtots","offset":2766},{"uri":"Eurasian_Economic_Union","surface_form":"Eurasian Economic Union","offset":2820},{"uri":"Council_of_Europe","surface_form":"Council of Europe","offset":2849},{"uri":"Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization","surface_form":"Collective Security Treaty Organization","offset":2875},{"uri":"Republic_of_Artsakh","surface_form":"Republic of Artsakh","offset":2958}]}
