{"id":56003,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare","text":"e=\"preserve\">Biological warfare (or germ warfare) is when pathogens are used as a weapon. This is called a biological weapon. Pathogens are microorganisms that can cause disease. If non-living things (like toxins) are used, this is called chemical warfare.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, biological weapons were used by the Japanese army against China. The Japanese army usually launched contaminated fleas or food from planes.\nToday, pathogens for diseases like anthrax or smallpox could be used as agents for biological weapons.\nThe production, and stockpiling of such weapons was forbidden in the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":58},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":82},{"uri":"Biological_weapon","surface_form":"biological weapon","offset":107},{"uri":"Microorganisms","surface_form":"microorganisms","offset":140},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":170},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":206},{"uri":"Chemical_warfare","surface_form":"chemical warfare","offset":239},{"uri":"Second_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"Second Sino-Japanese War","offset":268},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":352},{"uri":"Anthrax_(disease)","surface_form":"anthrax","offset":469},{"uri":"Smallpox","surface_form":"smallpox","offset":480},{"uri":"Biological_Weapons_Convention","surface_form":"Biological Weapons Convention","offset":606}]}
