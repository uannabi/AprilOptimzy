{"id":560051,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States","text":"Secession in the United States refers mainly to state secession. It applies to the outbreak of the American Civil War when on December 20, 1860, South Carolina officially declared their secession from the United States. It was followed four months later by the states of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. These initial seven seceding states formed the Confederate States of America based in Montgomery, Alabama. Then, on April 12, 1861, hostilities began at Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. After this, the states of Virginia (except the northwestern counties), Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina joined the Confederacy. The capital was then moved Richmond, Virginia. The Northern and Border states remained with the Union.\nHistory.\nIn 1860, secession was not a new threat. It had been discussed as early as 1776 when the Continental Congress wanted to tax all of the colonies based on a population count that included slaves. South Carolina threatened to separate themselves from the other 12 colonies over the issue. From then until the outbreak of the American Civil War, anytime a minority sectional dispute came up (often over slavery) the threat of secession would be used. It was a matter of concern when the Constitutional Convention met in 1787 in Philadelphia. Secession was closely tied to the thinking of members of the Whig party. Their thinking was that rebellion (such as in 1776) was a right of a state against any form of despotic government.\nWhen the South seceded in 1860-61, one argument was that in 1776, when the thirteen Colonies rebelled against Great Britain, it was a secession. Others argued the two situations were very different. The thirteen colonies revolted against Great Britain, they did not secede from it. What resulted was the American Revolutionary War. It can also be argued that the Southern states were revolting against the Union. Each of the colonies was regarding itself as a sovereign state and was waging a war of independence in cooperation with twelve other sovereign nations.\nReasons for secession.\nFollowing the war, scholars disagreed on what caused the Civil War. The disagreements still go on today. Many said that slavery was the main cause of the war. The Southern states wanted to continue it while the Northern states wanted to stop it. Others say slavery was not the main issue. They point to states' rights and taxation as leading causes.\nEach state that seceded wrote an \"Article of Secession\" formally declaring they were leaving the Union. Four states, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina, added a \"Declarations of Causes.\" These were written to explain the reasons for leaving in more detail.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"US_states","surface_form":"state","offset":48},{"uri":"Secession","surface_form":"secession","offset":54},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":99},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":145},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":205},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":271},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":280},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":289},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":298},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":311},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":321},{"uri":"Confederate_States_of_America","surface_form":"Confederate States of America","offset":379},{"uri":"Montgomery%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Montgomery, Alabama","offset":418},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"hostilities","offset":464},{"uri":"Fort_Sumter","surface_form":"Fort Sumter","offset":485},{"uri":"Charleston%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Charleston, South Carolina","offset":500},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":599},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":609},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":624},{"uri":"Richmond%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Richmond, Virginia","offset":690},{"uri":"Northern_United_States","surface_form":"Northern","offset":714},{"uri":"Border_states_(American_Civil_War)","surface_form":"Border states","offset":727},{"uri":"Union_(American_Civil_War)","surface_form":"Union","offset":759},{"uri":"Continental_Congress","surface_form":"Continental Congress","offset":864},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":895},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"colonies","offset":910},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":961},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":969},{"uri":"Section","surface_form":"section","offset":1136},{"uri":"Constitutional_Convention","surface_form":"Constitutional Convention","offset":1258},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":1299},{"uri":"Rebellion","surface_form":"rebellion","offset":1410},{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"right","offset":1444},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":1455},{"uri":"Despotism","surface_form":"despotic government","offset":1481},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"thirteen Colonies","offset":1577},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":1612},{"uri":"Revolt","surface_form":"revolt","offset":1723},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":1806},{"uri":"Sovereign_state","surface_form":"sovereign state","offset":1962},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":2109},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"Southern states","offset":2253},{"uri":"Northern_United_States","surface_form":"Northern states","offset":2301},{"uri":"States%27_rights","surface_form":"states' rights","offset":2393},{"uri":"Taxation","surface_form":"taxation","offset":2412}]}
