{"id":56026,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide","text":"e=\"preserve\">Iron oxides are chemical compounds. There are sixteen known iron oxides. Iron oxides are used in pigments. It is used in both man-made and natural pigments.\nVenetian red (haematite), Magnetite (Fe3O4), or a mixture of oxides make black or purple pigments. The umber, sienna and ochre are oxides or hydrated oxides of a yellow to chestnut colour.\nMost iron oxide is mined as iron ore. Every year millions of tons go into blast furnaces to make iron.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":29},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":73},{"uri":"Oxide","surface_form":"oxide","offset":78},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":110},{"uri":"Man-made","surface_form":"man-made","offset":139},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"natural","offset":152},{"uri":"Haematite","surface_form":"haematite","offset":184},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":243},{"uri":"Purple","surface_form":"purple","offset":252},{"uri":"Umber","surface_form":"umber","offset":273},{"uri":"Sienna","surface_form":"sienna","offset":280},{"uri":"Ochre","surface_form":"ochre","offset":291},{"uri":"Hydrate","surface_form":"hydrate","offset":311},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":332},{"uri":"Chestnut_(color)","surface_form":"chestnut","offset":342},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"colour","offset":351},{"uri":"Blast_furnace","surface_form":"blast furnace","offset":433}]}
