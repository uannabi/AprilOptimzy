Two years later, she told Keenan to move to Michigan with his father.\nThe Army.\nKeenan joined the United States Army after he graduated from high school. He wanted to use the G.I. Bill to go to art school. He joined the United States Military Academy Preparatory School (West Point Prep School) where he picked up the nickname \"Maynard\". He did very well in his training, but said no to an offer to stay in the Army and work at West Point. He decided to start his music career instead.\nArt.\nAfter being honorably discharged from the Army, Keenan went back to Michigan to go to art school. Then, in 1988, he moved to Los Angeles, California to help design the inside of pet stores. He was fired from this job and then worked creating movie sets. He also played bass guitar in a band and sang for another band.\nMusic career.\nKeenan started playing soon after leaving art school. Then he and Adam Jones formed Tool.
