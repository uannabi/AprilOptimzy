{"id":560442,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema","text":"Angioedema is swelling that is similar to hives, but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface.\nHives are often called welts. They are a surface swelling. It is possible to have angioedema without hives.\nCauses.\nAngioedema may be caused by an allergic reaction. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an allergen.\nIn most cases, the cause of angioedema is never found.\nHives and angioedema may also occur after infections or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as lupus, leukemia, and lymphoma).\nA form of angioedema happens in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hives","surface_form":"hives","offset":42},{"uri":"Allergy","surface_form":"allergic reaction","offset":258},{"uri":"Histamine","surface_form":"histamine","offset":298},{"uri":"Lupus","surface_form":"lupus","offset":634},{"uri":"Leukemia","surface_form":"leukemia","offset":641},{"uri":"Lymphoma","surface_form":"lymphoma","offset":655}]}
