It is the highest peak in the Jura Mountains and the department of Ain in France.\nIt is in the Jura Mountains Regional Natural Park ().\nGeography.\nCr\u00EAt de la Neige is between the \"communes\" of L\u00E9lex (to the northwest) and Thoiry (to the southeast) in the Ain department.\nIt is found in the \"Haute Cha\u00EEne\", the most eastern and highest chain of the French Jura mountains; it is in the \"Pays de Gex\" (the Arrondissement of Gex, Ain department), about to the northwest of the city of Geneva.\nThe Cr\u00EAt de la Neige is surrounded by the plain of the \"Pays de Gex\" to the east and the Valserine valley (a valley among the Jura mountains formed by the Valserine river) to the west.\nFrom the summit (or near the summit because it is covered with shrubs and trees), it is possible to see Geneva and the \"Pays de Gex\" and there is a 360\u00B0 view over the Lake Geneva, the Valserine valley, La D\u00F4le (a peak of the Jura mountains that is in Switzerland) and the Alps. On a clear day, it is possible to see the Vosges mountains and the Black Forest.\nElevation.\nIn the past, the official elevation given for the Cr\u00EAt de la Neige was, and so it appears in old maps, only higher than the near peak of Reculet. But recent studies made by the Institut g\u00E9ographique national (IGN) in Villeurbanne found that the true altitude of the Cr\u00EAt de la Neige is above sea level.\nGetting there.\nThe easiest route to get to the Cr\u00EAt de la Neige is from the Tiocan lookout point that is beyond Thoiry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":27},{"uri":"Thoiry%2C_Ain","surface_form":"Thoiry","offset":56},{"uri":"Peak","surface_form":"peak","offset":82},{"uri":"Jura_Mountains","surface_form":"Jura Mountains","offset":94},{"uri":"Ain","surface_form":"Ain","offset":131},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":138},{"uri":"L%C3%A9lex","surface_form":"L\u00E9lex","offset":257},{"uri":"Thoiry%2C_Ain","surface_form":"Thoiry","offset":286},{"uri":"Ain","surface_form":"Ain","offset":319},{"uri":"Mountain_chain","surface_form":"chain","offset":399},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":412},{"uri":"Arrondissement_of_Gex","surface_form":"Arrondissement of Gex","offset":467},{"uri":"Geneva","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":545},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":595},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":652},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summit","offset":747},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":801},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":812},{"uri":"Geneva","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":842},{"uri":"Lake_Geneva","surface_form":"Lake Geneva","offset":905},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":989},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":1010},{"uri":"Black_Forest","surface_form":"Black Forest","offset":1083},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":1134},{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":1205},{"uri":"Villeurbanne","surface_form":"Villeurbanne","offset":1325},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":1358},{"uri":"Above_sea_level","surface_form":"above sea level","offset":1394},{"uri":"Lookout","surface_form":"lookout","offset":1494},{"uri":"Thoiry%2C_Ain","surface_form":"Thoiry","offset":1523}]}
