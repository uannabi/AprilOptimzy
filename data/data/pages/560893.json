The symbols have been a topic of debate amongst historians.\nThe\u00A0T\u0103rt\u0103ria tablets\u00A0are three\u00A0tablets discovered in 1961 in the village of\u00A0T\u0103rt\u0103ria(Hungarian: Als\u00F3tat\u00E1rlaka). This is about 30\u00A0km (19\u00A0mi) from\u00A0Alba Iulia\u00A0in\u00A0Romania.<a href=\"Writing%23cite_note-10\">a></a>The tablets, dated to around 5300 BC,<a href=\"Writing%23cite_note-11\">a></a>\u00A0have symbols inclay: the\u00A0Vin\u010Da symbols. Some claim they are a yet undeciphered language. If this is so, they would be the earliest known form of writing. In 1908 similar symbols were found during excavations, by Miloje Vasi\u0107 (1869\u20131956) in Vin\u010Da. This is a suburb of Belgrade\u00A0(Serbia), some 300 km from Turda\u0219. Later, more were found in another part of Belgrade. Since 1875 over one hundred and fifty Vin\u010Da sites have been found in Serbia alone. Many, including Vin\u010Da itself, have not been fully excavated. The culture of the whole area is called the Vin\u010Da culture. Although some of these symbols look exactly the same as some letters in Etruscan, Greek, and Aramaic,<a href=\"Writing%23cite_note-12\">a></a>\u00A0they are generally regarded as a an original, independent development.<a href=\"Writing%23cite_note-13\">a></a>","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vin%C4%8Da_culture","surface_form":"Vin\u010Da culture","offset":62},{"uri":"Clay_tablet","surface_form":"tablets","offset":211},{"uri":"Hungarian_language","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":265},{"uri":"Alba_Iulia","surface_form":"Alba Iulia","offset":325},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":339},{"uri":"Belgrade","surface_form":"Belgrade","offset":730},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":740}]}
