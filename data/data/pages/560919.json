{"id":560919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_clipper","text":"Hair clippers are tools used to cut hair close to the head. Similar tools are used to cut wool from sheep.\nHair clippers have a pair of\u00A0sharpened comb-like blades in close contact one above the other and the side which slide sideways relative to each other. The clipper is moved so that hair is positioned between the teeth of the comb, and cut with a scissor action when one blade slides sideways relative to the other.\nHistory.\nManual clippers were invented between 1850 and 1890 by Nikola Bizumic, a Serbian barber, and the hairstyles became popular amongst boys and men in school, prison and the military.\nLeo J. Wahl invented the first electric hair clipper. He first designed a hand-held massager for his uncle, Dr. Frank Wahl. Frank Wahl opened a manufacturing plant in Sterling, Illinois\u00A0to produce and sell Leo\u2019s massager. During this time, Leo would sell massagers to various barbers and noticed an opportunity to improve upon the tools barbers were using at the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Comb","surface_form":"comb","offset":146},{"uri":"Sterling%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Sterling, Illinois","offset":777}]}
