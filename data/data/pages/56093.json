He was educated in England and then worked in Africa for Shell Oil Company. In the Second World War, he was an RAF fighter pilot. It was after an air-crash and \"a monumental bash on the head\" that he began to write. The crash was the subject of his first published story, \"Shot Down Over Libya\".\nHe wanted to become an adult book writer but ended up as a children's book writer. He had a tragic life since his father and oldest sister both died when he was young. Roald Dahl said that the key to his success rested in sympathizing with children and realizing that to children, parents and school teachers are the enemy.\nHis stories are full of huge, wild ideas and he hoped they would help children to learn to love books. He is one of the world's most popular children's writers.\nDahl wrote many famous children's stories and adult horror stories. Many of his books and stories have been made into films and TV shows all over the world. Among his most popular books are \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"James and the Giant Peach\", \"Matilda\", \"The Witches\", \"The BFG\", Fantastic Mr Fox, and \"Kiss Kiss\". Many of his children's books have pictures drawn by Quentin Blake.\nDahl was married to Patricia Neal from 1953 until they divorced in 1983. They had four daughters (one of whom died before them) and a son. Dahl was married to Felicity Crosland from 1983 until his death. He lived in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. He died on 23 November 1990 in Oxford, from myelodysplastic syndrome, aged 74.\nModel Sophie Dahl is his granddaughter.\nThere is a Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in Great Missenden.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":56},{"uri":"Llandaff","surface_form":"Llandaff","offset":98},{"uri":"Cardiff","surface_form":"Cardiff","offset":108},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":117},{"uri":"Norwegians","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":126},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":191},{"uri":"Shell_Oil_Company","surface_form":"Shell Oil Company","offset":202},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":228},{"uri":"RAF","surface_form":"RAF","offset":256},{"uri":"Horror","surface_form":"horror","offset":978},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"films","offset":1044},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"TV","offset":1054},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":1076},{"uri":"Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory","surface_form":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory","offset":1117},{"uri":"James_and_the_Giant_Peach","surface_form":"James and the Giant Peach","offset":1154},{"uri":"Matilda_(novel)","surface_form":"Matilda","offset":1183},{"uri":"The_Witches_(book)","surface_form":"The Witches","offset":1194},{"uri":"The_BFG","surface_form":"The BFG","offset":1209},{"uri":"Kiss_Kiss_(book)","surface_form":"Kiss Kiss","offset":1242},{"uri":"Quentin_Blake","surface_form":"Quentin Blake","offset":1306},{"uri":"Patricia_Neal","surface_form":"Patricia Neal","offset":1341},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":1376},{"uri":"Great_Missenden","surface_form":"Great Missenden","offset":1537},{"uri":"Buckinghamshire","surface_form":"Buckinghamshire","offset":1554},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":1602},{"uri":"Myelodysplastic_syndrome","surface_form":"myelodysplastic syndrome","offset":1615},{"uri":"Model_(person)","surface_form":"Model","offset":1650},{"uri":"Sophie_Dahl","surface_form":"Sophie Dahl","offset":1656},{"uri":"Great_Missenden","surface_form":"Great Missenden","offset":1739}]}
