{"id":561010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation","text":"A ventilation system is a structure that controls airflow inside buildings. Its main function is to constantly supply fresh air, usually from the outside, while sending stale air back out.\u00A0Fans and pumps, vent grates and air flow tunnels are common in these structures.\nThe simplest systems are called \u201Cnatural ventilation,\u201D which usually means that they get their airflow through vents opening to the outside. Mechanical systems are more popular for industry. Mechanical systems are able to regulate other things, including temperature, relative humidity, and oxygen levels.\nUses.\nFresh air prevents issues like mold and bacteria growth, as well as the spread of disease.\u00A0It helps eliminate dust, which can lead to cleaner living standards.\u00A0Single rooms can sometimes be ventilated by opening a window or door, but this isn\u2019t as successful for larger structures.\nVentilation usually collaborates with heating and cooling systems, but not always and they aren\u2019t only limited to buildings. Vehicles frequently have ventilation systems that control air circulation and air quality.\nHistory.\nIn ancient Persia, structures called windcatchers were built to create natural ventilation. These structures are a traditional method in Persia. They became very popular and are still in use across the Middle East.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
