The team has won the 1954 FIFA World Cup, 1974 FIFA World Cup, 1990 FIFA World Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup. The team came as second in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, 1982 FIFA World Cup, 1986 FIFA World Cup and in 2002 FIFA World Cup. In the 1934 FIFA World Cup, 1970 FIFA World Cup, 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup, the team got third place. The teams current coach is Joachim L\u00F6w, who took over from J\u00FCrgen Klinsmann.\nFrom 1950 to 1990, the team was mainly West Germany. Other teams were around that are now part of Germany. These include the East German team (1952-1990) and the Saarland team (1950-1956).\nGermany has always been one of the best teams in the world. Germany is the only team to have won men's and women's world cup titles. Also, Germany's main rivals are England, the Netherlands and Argentina.\nThe teams recent performance in a tournament was a victory over Argentina to win the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the semi-final against Brazil, Germany thrashed them with a 7\u20131 win, making it the largest win in FIFA World Cup semi-final history. Miroslav Klose, one of the greatest German players of all time, also scored a record breaking goal that made him the top scorer in FIFA World Cup history.\nOliver Kahn and Michael Ballack era.\nAfter another World Cup exit in 1998, Germany's status as one of the best teams in the world was beginning to go away. In the UEFA Euro 2000, Germany failed to advance to the next round, after losing two matches and one draw in the group stage. The manager at the time then resigned and was replaced by Rudi V\u00F6ller.\nGoing into the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the expectations for Germany was low because of the mediocre performance in the qualifiers. However, they performed very well in the World Cup, eventually making it to the finals but losing to Brazil 0\u20132. Miroslav Klose of Germany won the Silver Boot and Oliver Kahn won the Golden Ball.\nGermany again failed to advance to the next round in the UEFA Euro 2004 after they tied two matches and lost one. The manager Rudi V\u00F6ller resigned shortly afterwards. J\u00FCrgen Klinsmann then replaced him, although having no experience. Joachim L\u00F6w was also assigned to assist him. Klinsmann made Michael Ballack captain after the Euro 2004. Klinsmann main goal was to help Germany perform well in the next world cup.\nBefore the tournament, not many people expected Germany to do well because of their performance in the last tournaments. However, Germany won the first match of the tournament against Costa Rica. They continued to build confidence, and they eventually advanced to next stage with three wins in the group stage. Germany then beat Sweden 2\u20130 in the Round of 16.\nGermany then faced favourites Argentina in the quarter-finals. Argentina took the lead first in the match with a goal by Roberto Ayala in the 49th minute. Miroslav Klose then equalized with a goal at the 80th minute. The game later went to a penalty shootout, with Germany winning 4\u20132 and their goalkeeper Jens Lehmann making two saves.\nAlthough many then expected Germany to reach the final, they lost in the Semi-finals to Italy after Italy scored two goals in extra time. However, the German team went on to thrash Portugal 3\u20131 in the third place match. After the World Cup, Miroslav Klose won the Golden Boot and Lukas Podolski won the Best Young Player award.Also, four of Germany's players were put in the All-Star squad. When the German team arrived back in Berlin, they were greeted by 500,000 fans who were all honoring the German team.\nJoachim L\u00F6w takes the throne.\nKlinsmann left the German team after the World Cup, with Joachim L\u00F6w taking the throne. L\u00F6w was known for often putting young players in the team. The German team then easily qualified for the UEFA Euro 2008. In the final tournament, Germany advanced to the next round after they finished the group stage with two wins and one loss to Croatia. Germany then played Portugal in the quarter-finals and beat them 3\u20132 with goals from Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose and Michael Ballack. They then went to the Semi-finals against Turkey and barely defeated them 3\u20132 after Philipp Lahm scored on the 90th minute. In the final of the Euro 2008, Spain were the favourites but Germany was believed to have a chance. Spain took control of the game and with Fernando Torres's goal, Spain won the tournament.\n2010 FIFA World Cup.\nGermany easily qualified in their qualifying group against Azerbaijan, Finland, Liechtenstein, Russia and Wales. In the tournament, Germany advanced through the group stage after winning two games and loosing one against Serbia. Germany then went on to dominate the Round of 16 and Quarter-finals after defeating England 4\u20131 and thrashing Argentina 4\u20130. In the semi-finals, Germany lost to Spain 1\u20130. Germany then beat Uruguay 3\u20132 to become the third place medal winners. Thomas M\u00FCller won the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player award. Germany also scored the most than any other team in the tournament, with 16 goals.\nEuro 2012.\nGermany won all ten of their qualifying matches for the UEFA Euro 2012. They later were placed in Group B along with Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark. The team went on to win all their matches in the group stage and broke a record of 15 consecutive wins in all matches. They then beat Greece 4\u20132 in the quarter-finals with goals from Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Miroslav Klose and Marco Reus. However, they lost to Italy 1\u20132 in the semi-finals.\n2014 FIFA World Cup.\nGermany almost had ten straight wins in the qualifying round for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, in a game against Sweden, the team conceded 4 goals when they were up 4\u20130 up. The team performed well in the international friendlies before the World Cup with an unbeaten streak. Their most notable win was against Armenia, where they won 6\u20131. Germany was put in Group G with Portugal, Ghana and the United States.\nThe first match against Portugal ended with Germany defeating them 4\u20130; with the help of Thomas M\u00FCller's hat-trick. Their second game against Ghana ended with a 2\u20132 draw after Miroslav Klose equalized the score. Their final game ended with a win against the United States after Thomas M\u00FCller scored at the 55th minute. In the quarter-finals, Mats Hummels scored the winning goal at the 13th minute, meaning that Germany advanced to their fourth consecutive semi-final in the FIFA World Cup. In the semi-final against Brazil, Germany thrashed them with a 7\u20131 win, making it the largest win in FIFA World Cup semi-final history. Miroslav Klose also scored a record breaking goal that made him the top scorer in FIFA World Cup history. The win began to be known as the Miracle of Belo Horizonte. Germany then went on to their 8th World Cup final in history. In the final, Mario G\u00F6tze scored at the 113th minute to help Germany defeat Argentina 1\u20130.\nEuro 2016.\nGermany was put in a qualifying group with Poland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Georgia and Gibraltar. They qualified at the top of their group after 7 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses. They are currently placed with Ukraine, Poland and Northern Ireland in the group stage.\nStadiums.\nGermany doesn't have an official stadium, so they use many stadiums.
