{"id":561739,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wepwawet","text":"=\"preserve\">In late Egyptian Mythology Wepwawet (also rendered Upuaut) was originally a war deity whose cult centre was Asyut in Upper Egypt. His name means \"opener of the ways\" and he is often depicted as a wolf standing at the prow of a solar boat. Some interpret that Wepwawet is seen as a scout going out to clear routes for the army to proceed forward. One inscription from the Sinai states that Wepwawet \"opens the way\" to king Sekhemkhet's victory.\nOver time, the connection to war, and thus to death, led to Wepwawet also being seen as one who opened the ways to, and through, Duat, for the spirits of the dead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"late Egyptian Mythology","offset":15},{"uri":"Asyut","surface_form":"Asyut","offset":120},{"uri":"Upper_Egypt","surface_form":"Upper Egypt","offset":129},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":485},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":502},{"uri":"Duat","surface_form":"Duat","offset":585}]}
