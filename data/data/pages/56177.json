He enjoyed collecting model cars, including racers. In 2000, he told an interviewer for \"Esquire\" that, while growing up, he admired his father's ability to tell jokes and be the life of the party.

The elder Letterman died of a second heart attack at age 57.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Late_Show_with_David_Letterman","surface_form":"Late Show with David Letterman","offset":138},{"uri":"CBS","surface_form":"CBS","offset":173},{"uri":"Late_Night_with_David_Letterman","surface_form":"Late Night with David Letterman","offset":201},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":237},{"uri":"Johnny_Carson","surface_form":"Johnny Carson","offset":289},{"uri":"Irony","surface_form":"ironic","offset":392},{"uri":"Andy_Kaufman","surface_form":"Andy Kaufman","offset":438},{"uri":"Ernie_Kovacs","surface_form":"Ernie Kovacs","offset":452},{"uri":"Johnny_Carson","surface_form":"Johnny Carson","offset":491},{"uri":"Steve_Allen","surface_form":"Steve Allen","offset":509},{"uri":"Indianapolis","surface_form":"Indianapolis","offset":567},{"uri":"Indiana","surface_form":"Indiana","offset":581},{"uri":"Dorothy_Mengering","surface_form":"Dorothy Letterman","offset":672},{"uri":"Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway","surface_form":"Indianapolis Motor Speedway","offset":869},{"uri":"Esquire_(magazine)","surface_form":"Esquire","offset":987},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1294}]}
