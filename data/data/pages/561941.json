President Mario Soares appointed Guterres as prime minister and his Cabinet took the oath of office on 28 October that year.\nGuterres was a popular prime minister in the first years of his office. Portugal had a strong economic expansion which allowed the Socialists to reduce budget deficits while increasing welfare spending and creating new conditional cash transfer programs. Guterres was against homosexuality during his term as Prime Minister. He supported United Nations intervention in East Timor in 1999.\nAfter the 1999 parliamentary election, Guterres was re-appointed for the office and from January to July 2000. This second term in government was not as successful. The Hintze Ribeiro Bridge disaster damaged his authority and popularity. In October 2000, the Parliament approved the decriminalization of drug use (effective from 1 July 2001) and in March 2001, same-sex marriage were legalized.\nIn December 2001, Guterres resigned to \"prevent the country from falling into a political swamp\".\nPresident of Socialist International.\nGuterres was elected President of Socialist International in November 1999.

Guterres left office on 31 December 2015.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General.\nGuterres became United Nations Secretary-General on 1 January 2017, following his formal election by the UN General Assembly on 13 October 2016.\nDuring his first year, Guterres made world peace a first priority. In June 2017, he criticized the Trump administration and said the United States would be replaced from the United Nations if they do not take action on any international issues. Guterres criticized the intervention of Yemen and said a war from this would be \"stupid\".\nIn 2018, he called Syria a \"living hell\" in response to the Bashar al-Assad regime. He praised Trump and Kim Jong-un's summit and called it a \"crucial milestone\" for nuclear disarmament. In August 2018, Guterres wanted an independent investigation into a Saudi Arabian air strike in Yemen that killed 51 people.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1972, Guterres married Lu\u00EDsa Am\u00E9lia Guimar\u00E3es e Melo.
