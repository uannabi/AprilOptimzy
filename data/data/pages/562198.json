{"id":562198,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playback_singer","text":"e=\"preserve\">A playback singer is a singer whose singing is pre-recorded for use in movies. Playback singers record songs for soundtracks. The actors or actresses lip-sync the songs for cameras. The actual singer does not appear on screen.\nSouth Asian movies produced in the Indian subcontinent are particularly known for using this technique. A majority of Indian movies as well as Pakistani movies typically include six or seven songs. Popular playback singers in India enjoy the same status as popular actors. Most of the playback singers are initially trained in classical music. Mohammed Rafi and Ahmed Rushdi are regarded as two of the most influential playback singers in South Asia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":36},{"uri":"Soundtrack","surface_form":"soundtrack","offset":126},{"uri":"Lip-sync","surface_form":"lip-sync","offset":163},{"uri":"South_Asian_cinema","surface_form":"South Asian movies","offset":240},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":275},{"uri":"Cinema_of_India","surface_form":"Indian movies","offset":358},{"uri":"Cinema_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistani movies","offset":383},{"uri":"Mohammed_Rafi","surface_form":"Mohammed Rafi","offset":584},{"uri":"Ahmed_Rushdi","surface_form":"Ahmed Rushdi","offset":602},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":679}]}
