{"id":5626,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Yare","text":"The River Yare is a river in the county of Norfolk, England.\nThe river starts south of Dereham in the county of Norfolk. From there it flows to the east of the world. The river flows along the southern edge of the city of Norwich. The river continues past Norwich into the tidal lake of Breydon Water. Here the Yare is joined by the Rivers Bure and Waveney. It empties into North Sea at Gorleston, Great Yarmouth.Google Chrome\nSmall coastal boats can sail along the river from Norwich to the North Sea. In the past, the river had a large number of boats carrying goods to Norwich. Larger modern boats cannot get across Breydon Water because it is not deep enough. Because of this, a canal was created at Reedham to provides a connection to the River Waveney.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":20},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":33},{"uri":"Norfolk","surface_form":"Norfolk","offset":43},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":52},{"uri":"Dereham","surface_form":"Dereham","offset":87},{"uri":"Norfolk","surface_form":"Norfolk","offset":112},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":214},{"uri":"Norwich%2C_England","surface_form":"Norwich","offset":222},{"uri":"Tidal_lake","surface_form":"tidal lake","offset":273},{"uri":"Breydon_Water","surface_form":"Breydon Water","offset":287},{"uri":"River_Bure","surface_form":"Bure","offset":340},{"uri":"River_Waveney","surface_form":"Waveney","offset":349},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":374},{"uri":"Gorleston","surface_form":"Gorleston","offset":387},{"uri":"Great_Yarmouth","surface_form":"Great Yarmouth","offset":398},{"uri":"Google_Chrome","surface_form":"Google Chrome","offset":413},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":433},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":441},{"uri":"Sail","surface_form":"sail","offset":451},{"uri":"Product_(consumer_goods)","surface_form":"good","offset":563},{"uri":"Breydon_Water","surface_form":"Breydon Water","offset":619},{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"canal","offset":683},{"uri":"Reedham%2C_Norfolk","surface_form":"Reedham","offset":704}]}
