{"id":562849,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Posen","text":"e=\"preserve\">SMS Posen was a German battleship built in 1907 and launched in 1910. She had twelve 11 inch guns in six turrets.\nThe ship sailed during most of the First World War, in the North Sea. The main battle she was in was the Battle of Jutland where she hit another German ship which then sank.\nThe ship served with her three sister ships for the majority of World War I. She saw extensive service in the North Sea, where she took part in several fleet sorties. These culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31\u00A0May\u00A0\u2013 1\u00A0June 1916, where \"Posen\" was heavily engaged in night-fighting against British light forces. In the confusion, the ship accidentally rammed the light cruiser SMS\u00A0\"Elbing\", which suffered serious damage and was scuttled later in the night.\nThe ship also conducted several deployments to the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy. In the first of these, \"Posen\" supported a German naval assault in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. The ship was sent back to the Baltic in 1918 to support the White Finns in the Finnish Civil War. At the end of the war, \"Posen\" remained in Germany while the majority of the fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. In 1919, following the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow, she was ceded to the British as a replacement for the ships that had been sunk. She was then sent to ship-breakers in the Netherlands and scrapped in 1922.\n\u00A0About.\nPosen\u00A0was 146 m long and 27 m wide. She weighed 18,873 tonnes. Her crew was 40 officers and 968 sailors, 1008 total. She had three coal engines and could go at 20 knots or 9600 miles at 12 knots.\nHer guns were 28 cm wide and were in six twin turrets in a hexagon shape around the ship. She also had 15cm and 8.8 cm anti aircraft guns. She carried six torpedo which she could shoot out the front, back and sides. She had thick armour along both sides, 30cm thick in most places.\n\u00A0History.\nPosen was first ordered in 1906 as the Ersatz Baden. She started being built on 11 June 1907 in secret. She sailed for the first time in December 1908. She cost the German government 36,920,000 Marks.\nShe went to Wilhelmshavenin 1910 and sailed out of there for the next\u00A04 years.
