{"id":562911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_North_American_heat_wave","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 1936 North American heat wave was the most severe heat wave in United States history. It happened in the middle of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.\nThe heat wave began in late June. It created great human suffering. It also caused drought in the Midwest and Great Plains. The lack of moisture, along with heat, destroyed huge numbers of crops.\nThis heat wave set records in many states, including Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois. In some states, the 1936 records were not broken until 2012. In Ohio, the temperature reached 110\u00B0F, almost tying the 1934 temperature record there.\nMore than 5,000 people in the United States died from this heat wave.\nThe heat also affected Canada.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heat_wave","surface_form":"heat wave","offset":67},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":80},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":136},{"uri":"Dust_Bowl","surface_form":"Dust Bowl","offset":161},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":268},{"uri":"Midwest","surface_form":"Midwest","offset":283},{"uri":"Great_Plains","surface_form":"Great Plains","offset":295},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":434},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":440},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":454},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":528},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":706}]}
