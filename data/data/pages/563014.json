{"id":563014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_fires_of_1988","text":"=\"preserve\">The Yellowstone fires of 1988 were the largest wildfires in the history of the Yellowstone National Park. They began as smaller individual fires. They spread quickly out of control. The fires were made worse by increasing wind and severe drought in the Western United States.\nThe fires burned for several months. On September 8, 1988, the entire park was closed to all non-emergency people for the first time in its history. The arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wildfire","surface_form":"wildfire","offset":59},{"uri":"Yellowstone_National_Park","surface_form":"Yellowstone National Park","offset":91},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":250},{"uri":"Western_United_States","surface_form":"Western United States","offset":265}]}
