{"id":5633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Cadbury","text":"=\"preserve\">South Cadbury is an archaeological site in south Somerset.\nIt was dug in the early 1970s, and it showed many times that people lived there. The first was in the early Neolithic (around 4000-3000 BC?) when the hill seems to have been an important place for groups of early farmers who moved around. Most things were found from when late Bronze Age people lived on the hill (around 1200 BC). In the Iron Age the site changed, with many big walls. There are signs that when the Romans came to Britain, they killed many people here. Ruins of a feasting hall built after the Roman time were also found in the dig. There are also legends connecting this place with King Arthur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeological","offset":32},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":61},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":179},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"farmers","offset":284},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":348},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":409},{"uri":"King_Arthur","surface_form":"King Arthur","offset":671}]}
