{"id":56331,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity","text":"=\"preserve\">In physics, a physical quantity is any physical property that can be quantified, that is, be measured using numbers. Examples of physical quantities are mass, amount of substance, length, time, temperature, electric current, light intensity, force, velocity, density, and many others. A physical quantity is always measured of natural non-living objects (Inanimate objects)\nThe foundation of physics rests upon physical quantities in term of which the laws of physics are expressed. Therefore, these quantities have to be measured accurately. Physical quantities are often divided into two categories; base quantities and derived quantities. Derived quantities are those quantities which are derived from other physical quantities. Examples of derived quantities are force, velocity, acceleration etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":15},{"uri":"Physical_property","surface_form":"physical property","offset":51},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":165},{"uri":"Amount_of_substance","surface_form":"amount of substance","offset":171},{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":192},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":200},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":206},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":219},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"light intensity","offset":237},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":254},{"uri":"Velocity","surface_form":"velocity","offset":261},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":271},{"uri":"Laws_of_physics","surface_form":"laws of physics","offset":464},{"uri":"Quantity","surface_form":"quantities","offset":512}]}
