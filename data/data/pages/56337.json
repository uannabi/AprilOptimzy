Cierva is credited with successful development of multi-bladed, fully articulated rotor systems. This type of system is widely used today in many multi-bladed helicopters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":34},{"uri":"Lift_(force)","surface_form":"lift","offset":61},{"uri":"Autogyro","surface_form":"autogyro","offset":255},{"uri":"Blade","surface_form":"blade","offset":406}]}
