{"id":563385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infobot","text":"Infobot is a Perl IRC bot, first written in 1995 by Kevin Lenzo. The bot's main goal was to remember URLs and associate them with a name, so if someone needed a specific web address they could ask the bot. For this reason, the first Infobot, in the #macintosh channel in the EFnet IRC network, had the nickname 'url'.\nThe main project is now inactive, many forks from the original program were made, some of which are still active. Many of these forks carry extra features.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Perl","surface_form":"Perl","offset":13},{"uri":"IRC_bot","surface_form":"IRC bot","offset":18},{"uri":"Uniform_Resource_Locator","surface_form":"URLs","offset":101},{"uri":"Uniform_Resource_Locator","surface_form":"web address","offset":170},{"uri":"EFnet","surface_form":"EFnet","offset":275},{"uri":"Internet_Relay_Chat","surface_form":"IRC","offset":281},{"uri":"Fork_(software_development)","surface_form":"forks","offset":357}]}
