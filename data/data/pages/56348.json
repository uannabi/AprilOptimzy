It is used to teach students and children to program a computer. It was developed to process lists of words. It was like the language LISP.\nIn 1967, the first Logo ran on a mainframe computer, a machine called a teletype was used to type in and printout the results. There was no screen.\nIn 1969, it was used to control a Floor Turtle. Commands were added to send the turtle forwards and backwards, and to turn the turtle to left or right. This turtle had pen with different colors. When it moved, it left a trail on the floor.\nWhen a new version of Logo was developed to draw graphics on a screen, it used the same commands. This was called Turtle graphics.\nThere are 170 versions of Logo. Many of them are open source and free. There are three Logo textbooks that can be downloaded free. Logo is usually an interpreted language.\nHello World.\nLoad the Logo program.
