{"id":56359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transmission","text":"e=\"preserve\">Power transmission is moving energy from where it is made to where it is used.\nPower is defined formally as units of energy per unit time.\nIn SI units: 1 watt = 1 joule/s = 1 newton * metre/second (1W=1J/s=1N\u00B7m/s).\nElectrical power.\nWith widespread establishment of power grids, power transmission has came to be associated most often with electric power transmission.\nMechanical power.\nElectrical power transmission has replaced mechanical power transmission in all but the very shortest distances. From the start of the industrial revolution until the end of the 19th century mechanical power transmission was the norm. Factories were fitted with overhead driveshafts providing rotary power. Drivebelts would provide power to individual machines on the shop floor.\nMechanical power may be transmitted directly using a solid structure such as a driveshaft; transmission gears can adjust the amount of torque or force vs. speed in much the same way an electrical transformer adjusts voltage vs current.\nChemicals and fuels.\nChemical energy is transmitted by moving fuel<nowiki/>s to generate power in distant places. Pipeline<nowiki/>s and other large infrastructure projects transport natural gas, petroleum and petroleum product<nowiki/>s for use as fuel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":42},{"uri":"Power_(physics)","surface_form":"Power","offset":92},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":130},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":146},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":155},{"uri":"Watt","surface_form":"watt","offset":167},{"uri":"Joule","surface_form":"joule","offset":176},{"uri":"Newton_(unit)","surface_form":"newton","offset":188},{"uri":"Power_grid","surface_form":"power grid","offset":279},{"uri":"Electric_power_transmission","surface_form":"electric power transmission","offset":353},{"uri":"Industrial_revolution","surface_form":"industrial revolution","offset":535},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":578},{"uri":"Driveshaft","surface_form":"driveshaft","offset":671},{"uri":"Rotary_power","surface_form":"rotary power","offset":693},{"uri":"Driveshaft","surface_form":"driveshaft","offset":859},{"uri":"Transmission_(mechanics)","surface_form":"transmission","offset":871},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":915},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":925},{"uri":"Speed","surface_form":"speed","offset":935},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":996},{"uri":"Current_(electricity)","surface_form":"current","offset":1007},{"uri":"Chemical_energy","surface_form":"Chemical energy","offset":1037},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":1078},{"uri":"Pipeline","surface_form":"Pipeline","offset":1130},{"uri":"Infrastructure","surface_form":"infrastructure","offset":1165},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":1199},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"petroleum","offset":1212},{"uri":"Petroleum_product","surface_form":"petroleum product","offset":1226}]}
