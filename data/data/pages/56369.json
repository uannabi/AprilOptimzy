{"id":56369,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea","text":"=\"preserve\">Nausea is a general feeling of unease and discomfort in the stomach, often with the urge to vomit. The word \"nausea\" comes from the Latin word for seasickness.\nNausea is a symptom, rather than an illness or disease. The causes for it very often are not in the stomach itself, but somewhere else in the body. Nausea is often caused by a stomach virus. Nausea is usually harmless, in the short term. A good treatment for it can be not to take solid food (and to only drink non-alcoholic drinks, like water). Nausea can also occur during pregnancy, and is quite normal in that context. People can suffer nausea without vomiting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":72},{"uri":"Vomit","surface_form":"vomit","offset":104},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":144},{"uri":"Seasickness","surface_form":"seasickness","offset":159},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":184},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":219},{"uri":"Treatment","surface_form":"treatment","offset":417},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":547}]}
