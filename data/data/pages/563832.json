Kennedy Int'l Airport to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport on July 17, 1996. The aircraft was a Boeing 747-100. The plane exploded just 12\u00A0minutes after takeoff. It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York. The cause was determined to be a spark that ignited the center wing fuel tank. None of the 230 people onboard survived. It remains the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.\nPassengers and Crew.\nMost of the 230 occupants on-board were from the United States, but 42 more came from France, 10 from Argentina, and 60 more from sixteen other countries.\nThe pilots on board TWA Flight 800 were Captain Ralph G.
