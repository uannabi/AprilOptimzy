{"id":56415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)","text":"The magnitude of a mathematical object is its size: a property by which it can be larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind.\nIn mathematical language one would say: It is an ordering of the class of objects to which it belongs.\nThey had proven that the first two could not be the same, or even isomorphic systems of magnitude. They did not consider negative magnitudes to be meaningful, and \"magnitude\" is still primarily used in contexts in which zero is either the lowest size, or less than all possible sizes.\nReal numbers.\nThis gives the number's distance from zero on the real number line. For example, the modulus of -5 is 5.\nVector.\nThe magnitude of a vector formula_1 is called its norm, and is usually written as formula_1. It measures the length of the vector. For a three-dimensional vector formula_1, the norm can be calculated using the formula formula_1.\nPractical math.\nA magnitude is never negative. When comparing magnitudes, it is often helpful to use a logarithmic scale. Real-world examples include the loudness of a sound (decibel), the brightness of a star, or the Richter scale of earthquake intensity.\nBecause magnitudes are often not linear, they usually cannot be added or subtract in a meaningful way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Size","surface_form":"size","offset":46},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":140},{"uri":"Ordering","surface_form":"ordering","offset":186},{"uri":"Class_(mathematics)","surface_form":"class","offset":202},{"uri":"Isomorphic","surface_form":"isomorphic","offset":306},{"uri":"Number_line","surface_form":"number line","offset":594},{"uri":"Norm_(mathematics)","surface_form":"norm","offset":702},{"uri":"Logarithm","surface_form":"logarithm","offset":984},{"uri":"Loudness","surface_form":"loudness","offset":1035},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":1049},{"uri":"Decibel","surface_form":"decibel","offset":1056},{"uri":"Brightness","surface_form":"brightness","offset":1070},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":1086},{"uri":"Richter_magnitude_scale","surface_form":"Richter scale","offset":1099}]}
