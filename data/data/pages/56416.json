{"id":56416,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)","text":"A fraction is a number that shows how many equal parts there are. When we write fractions, we show one number with a line above (or a slash next to) another number. For example, formula_1, and 1/4.are different ways of writing the same fraction (in this case a quarter). The top number tells us how many parts there are, and the bottom number tells us the total number of parts.\nThe top part of the fraction is called a numerator. The bottom part of the fraction is called a denominator. For example, for the fraction formula_1, the 1 is the numerator, and the 4 is the denominator.\nMathematical fractions.\nA fraction is a mathematical expression relating two quantities or numbers, where one divides the other. When the two quantities are whole numbers (or integers), this is called a rational number (such as the fraction formula_1). When the two quantities are polynomials, this is called a rational function.\nMathematically, a fraction is a quotient of numbers, representing the number's value when the numerator (upper number) is divided by the denominator (lower number). Thus formula_1 means one divided by two, or, in decimals, 0.5.\nTo find formula_1 of formula_1, the denominators are multiplied, and because denominator 2 multiplied by 2 equals 4, we have that formula_1 x formula_1 = formula_1, or 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.\nTo find formula_1 \"divided by\" formula_1, multiply formula_1 by the reciprocal of formula_1, which is 2. That answer is 1.\nMultiplying.\nTo multiply two fractions, the first numerator is multiplied by the other numerator, and the first denominator is multiplied by the other denominator. For example. x =. One can simplify this by dividing both numbers by a common factor. This would be after the simplication.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numerator","surface_form":"numerator","offset":420},{"uri":"Denominator","surface_form":"denominator","offset":475},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":623},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":674},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"divides","offset":693},{"uri":"Whole_number","surface_form":"whole number","offset":740},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":758},{"uri":"Rational_number","surface_form":"rational number","offset":786},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":864},{"uri":"Rational_function","surface_form":"rational function","offset":894},{"uri":"Quotient","surface_form":"quotient","offset":945},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":957},{"uri":"Reciprocal","surface_form":"reciprocal","offset":1395},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplied","offset":1513}]}
