{"id":564173,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Moko","text":"e=\"preserve\">\u201CTa Moko\u201D means tattoo art in Maori.\nOften these tattoos covered the whole face and were a symbol of rank, social status, power and prestige for the Maori people.\nTa Moko is a visual language which connects the person who has it to his \u201Cwhakapapa\u201D. Whakapapa is the family, it\u2019s the genealogical tree, so there is nothing which links religion to Ta Moko.\nTa Moko symbolises identification with their origins. It is considered to be beautiful but ferocious because they have to frighten their enemies. The Maori facial tattoo was used as a kind of \u201Cidentification card\u201D.\nThese tattooes look like animals or geometric shapes. The most popular tattoo is \u201Cthe tortoise\u201D.\nThe technique of making tattooes leaves scars. Traditional tools to make Ta Moko are albatross bone chisels and black ink. A Maori tattoo takes a lot of time to do; generally the Maori people start tattooing themselves in adolescence and they finish in adulthood. They take years to be finished. But a real Ta Moko is very painful. The tattoo artist removes your skin by making wide cuts with a mallet and either a Turtle scale or an Albatross bone. So it takes a long time and you suffer a lot.\nBoys start to be tattooed around adolescence but we don\u2019t know when women can start to be tattooed.\nMen\u2019s tattooes can be found everywhere on their bodies; whereas women can only have tattooes on their foreheads, necks, lips, chins and backs.\nThe number of tattooes they have depends on their age, what the people have done in their lives and the place of the person in the tribe. For Maoris these tattooes are like a diary because they are a written record of all the important events and places a man has experienced in his life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
