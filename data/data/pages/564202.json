{"id":564202,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan","text":"Tryptophan (Trp or W) is encoded by the codon UGG. It is an \u03B1-amino acid used in the biosynthesis of proteins.\nTryptophan has an \u03B1-amino group (which is in the \u2013NH3+ form under biological conditions), and an \u03B1-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated \u2013COO\u2212 form under biological conditions). It also has a side chain indole, which makes it a non-polar aromatic amino acid. Tryptophan is essential to humans: the body cannot synthesize it, so it must be got from the diet.\nTryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Codon","surface_form":"codon","offset":40},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":62},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesis","offset":88},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":101},{"uri":"Carboxylic_acid","surface_form":"carboxylic acid","offset":210},{"uri":"Deprotonation","surface_form":"deprotonated","offset":249},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":279},{"uri":"Indole","surface_form":"indole","offset":328},{"uri":"Aromatic_hydrocarbon","surface_form":"aromatic","offset":363},{"uri":"Essential_amino_acid","surface_form":"essential","offset":398},{"uri":"Precursor","surface_form":"precursor","offset":504},{"uri":"Neurotransmitter","surface_form":"neurotransmitter","offset":521},{"uri":"Serotonin","surface_form":"serotonin","offset":539},{"uri":"Melatonin","surface_form":"melatonin","offset":553}]}
