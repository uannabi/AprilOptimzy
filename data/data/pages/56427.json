{"id":56427,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, the quotient is the end result of a division. For example, in the division of 6\u00F73, the quotient would be 2. Here, 6 is also called the dividend, and 3 the divisor. The quotient can thus be expressed as the number of times the divisor adds together into the dividend.\nOn the other hand, a quotient can also mean just the integral part of the result of dividing two integers. For example, the quotient of 17 \u00F7 5 would be 3 (since 5 goes into 17 at most 3 times), whilst the remainder, the leftover of the division, would be 2.\nQuotients also come up in certain tests, like the IQ test, which evaluates one's intelligence quotient. In this case, the quotient is the score of the test. In recent decades, as people begin to emphasize multi-dimensional personal development, other similar quotients (such as emotional quotient) are being developed and considered as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"division","offset":65},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"dividend","offset":164},{"uri":"Divisor","surface_form":"divisor","offset":184},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integral","offset":349},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":501},{"uri":"Intelligence_quotient","surface_form":"intelligence quotient","offset":635}]}
