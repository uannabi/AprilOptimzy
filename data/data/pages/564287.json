{"id":564287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade_cell","text":"Palisade cells are special cells in the leaves of plants. They are the main place where photosynthesis takes place. Their function is to absorb light so photosynthesis can take place.\nThey have the largest number of chloroplasts per cell of any plant tissue, which makes them the main site of photosynthesis. In the leaves of plants, they convert the light to chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. The cells are just below the epidermis and cuticle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cells","offset":27},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":40},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":50},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":88},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":153},{"uri":"Chloroplast","surface_form":"chloroplasts","offset":216},{"uri":"Carbohydrates","surface_form":"carbohydrates","offset":391},{"uri":"Epidermis","surface_form":"epidermis","offset":435},{"uri":"Cuticle","surface_form":"cuticle","offset":449}]}
