{"id":56432,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"For the second operand of a division, see division (mathematics).\"\nIn mathematics, a divisor of an integer \"n\", also called a factor of \"n\", is an integer which evenly divides \"n\" without leaving a remainder. The statement \"m\" is a divisor of \"n\" can be written as formula_1. Any number is always evenly divisible by 1 and itself, which are two of the divisors. A prime number is a number with no other divisors. The positive divisors of a number \"n\", other than \"n\" itself, are the proper divisors of \"n\".\nFinding one or more factors of a given number is called factorization.\n__TOC__\nExplanation.\nFor example, 7 is a divisor of 42 because 42\u00F77 = 6. We also say that \"42 is divisible by 7\", \"42 is a multiple of 7\", \"7 divides 42\", or \"7 is a factor of 42\", and we usually write 7 | 42. For example, the positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\nIn general, we say that \"m\" divides \"n\" for non-zero integers \"m\" and \"n\", if and only if there exists an integer \"k\" such that \"n\" = \"km\". Thus, divisors can be negative as well as positive, although we often restrict our attention to positive divisors. (For example, there are six divisors of four, 1, 2, 4, -1, -2, -4, but one would usually mention only the positive ones, 1, 2, and 4.)\n1 and -1 divide (are divisors of) every integer, every integer is a divisor of itself, and every integer is a divisor of 0, except by convention 0 itself (see also Division by zero). Numbers divisible by 2 are called even, and numbers not divisible by 2 are called odd.\nA divisor of \"n\" that is not 1, -1, \"n\" or -\"n\" is known as a non-trivial divisor; numbers with non-trivial divisors are known as composite numbers, while prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors.\nThe name comes from the arithmetic operation of division: if \"a\u00F7b\" = \"c\", then \"a\" is the dividend, \"b\" the divisor, and \"c\" the quotient.\nSpotting divisors.\nThere are properties which allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits. Those properties can be used as \"math tricks\" to quickly spot some divisors of a number.\nNote that any number is always evenly divisible by 1 and itself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"division (mathematics)","offset":57},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":85},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":114},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":213},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":379},{"uri":"Factorization","surface_form":"factorization","offset":578},{"uri":"If_and_only_if","surface_form":"if and only if","offset":950},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":1037},{"uri":"Division_by_zero","surface_form":"Division by zero","offset":1429},{"uri":"Even_number","surface_form":"even","offset":1482},{"uri":"Odd_number","surface_form":"odd","offset":1530},{"uri":"Composite_number","surface_form":"composite number","offset":1665},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":1690},{"uri":"Arithmetic","surface_form":"arithmetic","offset":1758},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"division","offset":1782},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"dividend","offset":1824},{"uri":"Quotient","surface_form":"quotient","offset":1863},{"uri":"Divisibility_rule","surface_form":"properties","offset":1902}]}
