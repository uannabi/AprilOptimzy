{"id":564322,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagerordnung","text":"The \"Lagerordnung\" (the \"Disciplinary and Penal Code\") was a set of rules for punishing prisoners at Dachau concentration camp in Nazi Germany. On January 1, 1934, the Lagerordnung became the official rules of every concentration camp in Nazi Germany.\nAlso known as the \"Strafkatalog\" (Punishment Catalogue), it set out the rules the prisoners had to follow. SS guards were told to report to the camp commandant when a prisoner broke a rule.\nThe Concentration Camps Inspectorate was in charge of carrying out punishment. They did this without making sure the prisoner had actually broken the rule. Once they were accused, prisoners had no way of proving themselves innocent.\nEvolution of a new penal system.\nAt first, the Nazis had built temporary concentration camps, like Kemna concentration camp. These earlier camps did not have common, agreed-upon rules. Instead, they took the \"Lagerordnung\" from rules that were often used in police departments and prisons at the time.\nThere was not much difference between the rules at the early concentration camps. Some did not allow smoking; others allowed prisoners to receive food parcels or visits from family members. The rules were still based on existing laws, and the camps were patterned after ordinary prisons. The early camps had penalties like having privileges taken away, or for more severe cases, solitary confinement, a hard bed, not being given food, or being left in solitary confinement in a darkened cell. However, there was no corporal punishment. The early camps were primarily controlled by the SA or the Gestapo.\nHowever, Dachau was under the control of the SS. Sometime in May 1933, SS camp commandant Hilmar W\u00E4ckerle wrote the first \"Lagerordnung\" for a concentration camp. It gave all legal powers to the camp commandant. The Dachau Lagerordnung allowed prisoners to be executed based on a decision from two SS men who had been chosen by the commandant. The accused prisoner would no longer have a defense. The executive, judicial, and legislative parts of government were all placed together under the camp commandant's power. There would be no system of checks and balances. The threat of the death penalty was always there, which created a constant state of emergency for Dachau's inmates.\nThe first legalized murders took place at Dachau. (There would never be as many political murders in any of the other, earlier concentration camps than there were in Dachau's first few months.) Sophie Handschuh, the mother of one of the murdered prisoners, filed a formal complaint to find out what had really happened to her son. The resulting prosecution forced Himmler to replace W\u00E4ckerle. Himmler chose Theodor Eicke, a fanatical \"SS-Oberf\u00FChrer\" who had, in March 1933, been committed for evaluation at a psychiatric clinic at the University of W\u00FCrzburg due to extremely violent behavior. Himmler arranged for Eicke to be released, asking his doctor, Werner Heyde, to talk to Eicke and get him to promise to control himself.\nExpanded to all camps.\nSix months later, on October 1, 1933, Commandant Eicke wrote a second edition of the \"Lagerordnung\", adding the Postenpflicht and introducing corporal punishment (flogging). The \"Lagerordnung\" established a \"state within a state.\" The second edition established an orderly system in which \"legally\" arrested political opponents could be tortured and executed.\nFrom this point on, all SS concentration camps were to follow the Dachau model and become a \"state within a state\": shielded centers of terror with their own laws and judges, without legal defense, and with their own executable violence.\nAfter January 1, 1934, all subsequent versions of the \"Lagerordnung\" were effective for all SS-run concentration camps.\nThe Disciplinary and Penal Code.\n[Translator's note: The sometimes odd phrasing, inconsistencies of capitalization, and style itself are from the source, not the translator.]\nOffice of the Commandant, October 1, 1933\nDisciplinary and Penal Code for the Detention Camp\nThe following penalties are issued within the scope of existing camp regulations, to maintain order and discipline on the grounds of Dachau concentration camp,\nThese regulations apply to all prisoners of the DCC from the time of admission on, till the hour of discharge.\n\"These rules are added on to the list of rules Dachau already has. Its goal is to keep order and discipline at Dachau. They apply to all prisoners, all the time.\"\nThe consummate authority of punishment is in the hands of the camp commandant, who is personally responsible to the political police commander for the implementation of the rules as issued.\n\"[The camp commandant has complete and total authority to punish prisoners. He is in charge of implementing these rules.]\"\nTolerance means weakness. Realizing this, there will be a ruthless grip there, where, in the interests of the fatherland, it appears necessary. The decent, incited [sic] \"Volksgenosse\" will not come into contact with these penalties. But to the politicizing rabble-rouser and intellectual agitator\u00A0\u2014 regardless of which direction\u00A0\u2014 let it be said, beware, that you're not nabbed, otherwise you'll be grabbed by the neck and after your own recipe, [sic] made to hold your peace.\n\"[\"Tolerance means peace.\" People who speak out against Germany will be punished badly. People who mind their own business and do not question Germany will not be punished this way. But people who try to cause trouble by getting people upset about politics will be forced to be quiet.]\"\n1.
