It is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is the national tree of Costa Rica.\n\"Enterolobium cyclocarpum\", the scientific name of the guanacaste tree was given by August Grisebach to this plant in 1864.\nDescription.\nThe guanacaste is a large tree, growing to tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is light gray. The crown (the upper part of tree) is broad and widely spreading. Leaves are long, alternate and compound.\nThe guanacaste is evergreen, or briefly deciduous for 1\u20132 months during the dry season (without rains). Most leaves fall in December, at the start of the dry season. In late February, leaves start to appear and produce a fresh, thick crown by April.\nFlowers are hermaphrodite; the pollination is by insects like bees.\nThe fruit is a legume (also known as a pod) with the shape of a human ear.\nWhere it grows.\nThe guanacaste tree is native to tropical America. It grows from southern Mexico through Central America to northern South America. It is found also in the West Indies. It has been introduced in other tropical regions.\nIt grows normally at an elevation from sea level to, usually along the coast and rivers.\nUses.\nThe wood is reddish-brown, lightweight and water-resistant; it is used to make objects like doors, windows, furniture, cabinets, and for shipbuilding. It is used also as firewood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":92},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering","offset":103},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":113},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":125},{"uri":"Fabaceae","surface_form":"Fabaceae","offset":137},{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropical","offset":163},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":187},{"uri":"List_of_national_trees","surface_form":"national tree","offset":207},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":224},{"uri":"Binomial_nomenclature","surface_form":"scientific name","offset":268},{"uri":"August_Grisebach","surface_form":"August Grisebach","offset":320},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":399},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":444},{"uri":"Bark","surface_form":"bark","offset":458},{"uri":"Spreading","surface_form":"spreading","offset":533},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"Leaves","offset":544},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":603},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":625},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":681},{"uri":"Hermaphrodite","surface_form":"hermaphrodite","offset":847},{"uri":"Pollination","surface_form":"pollination","offset":866},{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bee","offset":897},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":907},{"uri":"Legume","surface_form":"legume","offset":918},{"uri":"Ear","surface_form":"ear","offset":973},{"uri":"Native_(ecology)","surface_form":"native","offset":1017},{"uri":"Tropics","surface_form":"tropical","offset":1027},{"uri":"America","surface_form":"America","offset":1036},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1068},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1083},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1111},{"uri":"West_Indies","surface_form":"West Indies","offset":1150},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":1237},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":1252},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":1284},{"uri":"Rivers","surface_form":"rivers","offset":1294},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":1312},{"uri":"Furniture","surface_form":"furniture","offset":1416},{"uri":"Cabinet","surface_form":"cabinet","offset":1427},{"uri":"Shipbuilding","surface_form":"shipbuilding","offset":1445},{"uri":"Firewood","surface_form":"firewood","offset":1478}]}
