{"id":564586,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_English","text":"Simon William \"Bill\" English (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand politician. He was the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017 and the leader of the National Party. He was previously Deputy Prime Minister from 2008 to 2016.\nAt the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives.\nHowever, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the M\u0101ori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English announced that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. However, on 19 October 2017, Jacinda Ardern became the next Prime Minister after Winston Peters announced he would enter a coalition government with Labour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_New_Zealand","surface_form":"39th Prime Minister of New Zealand","offset":93},{"uri":"New_Zealand_National_Party","surface_form":"National Party","offset":168},{"uri":"Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand","surface_form":"Deputy Prime Minister","offset":202},{"uri":"New_Zealand_general_election%2C_2017","surface_form":"2017 general election","offset":250},{"uri":"New_Zealand_First","surface_form":"New Zealand First","offset":664},{"uri":"Jacinda_Ardern","surface_form":"Jacinda Ardern","offset":712},{"uri":"Winston_Peters","surface_form":"Winston Peters","offset":764}]}
