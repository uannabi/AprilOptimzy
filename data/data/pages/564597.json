{"id":564597,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data","text":"e=\"preserve\">Big data\u00A0is a term used for\u00A0certain database systems. It is used for a number of\u00A0technologies\u00A0which help to organize, gather and analyse data.\nUse.\nBig data is used to analyse different subjects. Through the analysis, new information can be gained. Bigger amounts of data make it easier to find reliable information. It is used in many different areas, such as government, health care, insurance, media, advertisement and information technology.\nCritique.\nBig data has been criticised for different reasons. One prominent criticism is the increasing surveillance to gather data, which takes place in many new forms. Edward Snowden has revealed how the American National Security Agency (NSA) uses digital technology to spy on people around the world. Another prominent criticisms is data privacy, which is about the risk of sensitive personal data leaking because it is not protected well enough.\nA more fundamental critique of big data is just because it is bigger, it is not automatically better. The quality of the data still has to be controlled. It also says that data analysis can only ask \"what\" is happening, but not \"why\" it is happening.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Database","surface_form":"database systems","offset":49},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technologies","offset":94},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":150},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analyse","offset":181},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":235},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":374},{"uri":"Health_care","surface_form":"health care","offset":386},{"uri":"Insurance","surface_form":"insurance","offset":399},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":410},{"uri":"Advertising","surface_form":"advertisement","offset":417},{"uri":"Information_technology","surface_form":"information technology","offset":435},{"uri":"Edward_Snowden","surface_form":"Edward Snowden","offset":629},{"uri":"National_Security_Agency","surface_form":"National Security Agency (NSA)","offset":674},{"uri":"Espionage","surface_form":"spy","offset":732},{"uri":"Privacy","surface_form":"privacy","offset":801}]}
