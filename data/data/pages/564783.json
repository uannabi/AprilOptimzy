{"id":564783,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terza_rima","text":"Terza rima is a three-line rhyme scheme of Italian origin.. The first line rhymes with the third one. The second line is free and can rhyme with a line in the next strophe.\nTerza rima occurs in sonnets. Sonnets are often composed of two quatrains and two terza rimas, for example abba abba cdc dcd. This scheme can be found in many Italian, Spanish and Portuguese sonnets. This sonnet by the 16th century Portuguese poet Francisco de S\u00E1 de Miranda is a good example.\n\"O sol \u00E9 grande, caem co\u2019a calma as aves,\"\n\"do tempo em tal saz\u00E3o, que s\u00F3i ser fria;\"\n\"esta \u00E1gua que d\u2019alto cai acordar-m\u2019-ia\"\n\"do sono n\u00E3o, mas de cuidados graves.\"\n\"\u00D3 cousas, todas v\u00E3s, todas mudaves,\"\n\"qual \u00E9 tal cora\u00E7\u00E3o qu\u2019em v\u00F3s confia?\"\n\"Passam os tempos vai dia tr\u00E1s dia,\"\n\"incertos muito mais que ao vento as naves.\"\n\"Eu vira j\u00E1 aqui sombras, vira flores,\"\n\"vi tantas \u00E1guas, vi tanta verdura,\"\n\"Tudo \u00E9 seco e mudo; e, de mestura,\"\n\"e tudo o mais renova, isto \u00E9 sem cura!\"\nUsually terza rimas are linked to each other making long chain-like sequences. There is an extra line at the end of the sequence. The scheme of rhymes is: aba bcb cdc ded... xyx yzy z. Terza rimas are suitable for long poems. The best known example is The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. Perhaps every child in Italy knows these lines by heart.\n\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\"\n\"mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,\"\n\"ch\u00E9 la diritta via era smarrita.\"\n\"Ahi quanto a dir qual era \u00E8 cosa dura\"\n\"esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte\"\n\"che nel pensier rinova la paura!\"\n\"Tant\u2019\u00E8 amara che poco \u00E8 pi\u00F9 morte;\"\n\"ma per trattar del ben ch\u2019i\u2019 vi trovai,\"\n\"dir\u00F2 de l\u2019altre cose ch\u2019i\u2019 v\u2019 ho scorte.\"\nSpanish poet Bernardo de Balbuena, who lived in Mexico, wrote a long poem in terza rima named \"Grandeza mexicana\"\n\"Oh t\u00FA, heroica beldad, saber profundo,\"\n\"que por milagro puesta a los mortales\"\n\"en todo fuiste la \u00FAltima del mundo;\"\n\"sobre que el mar del sur resaca y quiebra\"\n\"do haciendo a tu valor notoria quiebra,\"\n\"el tiempo fue tragando con su llama\"\n\"tu rico estambre y su preciosa hebra;\"\n\"There \u2019s a palace in Florence, the world knows well,\"\n\"And a statue watches it from the square,\"\n\"And this story of both do the townsmen tell.\"\n\"At the furthest window facing the east,\"\n\"Asked, \u201CWho rides by with the royal air?\u201D'\n\"The bridesmaids\u2019 prattle around her ceased:\"\n\"She leaned forth, one on either hand;\"\n\"They saw how the blush of the bride increased.\"\nPercy Bysshe Shelley invented a sonnet built of fout terza rimas and a couplet. It rhymes aba bcb cdc ded ee. Shelley used it in \"Ode to the Western Wind\". It consists of five sonnets. Let us look at the first one.\n\"O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,\"\n\"Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead\"\n\"Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,\"\n\"Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,\"\n\"Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed\"\n\"The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,\"\n\"Each like a corpse within its grave, until\"\n\"Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow\"\n\"Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill\"\n\"(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)\"\n\"With living hues and odours plain and hill:\"\n\"Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;\"\n\"Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear!\"\n</poem> American poet Robert Frost in his poem \"Acquainted with the Night\" used aba bcb cdc dad aa scheme.\nJan Kasprowicz, who translated Shelley's poem into Polish, used this scheme in a work by his own. It is called \"Cisza wieczorna\". (\"Evening Silence\").\nAnother form composed of terza rimas is a villanelle. It is made up of nineteen lines. It rhmymes acording to the scheme aba aba aba aba aba abaa. An example is \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rhyme","surface_form":"rhyme","offset":27},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":43},{"uri":"Sonnet","surface_form":"sonnet","offset":194},{"uri":"Quatrain","surface_form":"quatrain","offset":237},{"uri":"Francisco_de_S%C3%A1_de_Miranda","surface_form":"Francisco de S\u00E1 de Miranda","offset":421},{"uri":"Dante_Alighieri","surface_form":"Dante Alighieri","offset":1220},{"uri":"Bernardo_de_Balbuena","surface_form":"Bernardo de Balbuena","offset":1652},{"uri":"Percy_Bysshe_Shelley","surface_form":"Percy Bysshe Shelley","offset":2402},{"uri":"Sonnet","surface_form":"sonnet","offset":2434},{"uri":"Jan_Kasprowicz","surface_form":"Jan Kasprowicz","offset":3338},{"uri":"Villanelle","surface_form":"villanelle","offset":3531},{"uri":"Dylan_Thomas","surface_form":"Dylan Thomas","offset":3704}]}
