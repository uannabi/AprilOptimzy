{"id":564928,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning","text":"e=\"preserve\">Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1959). It is a subfield of computer science.\nThe idea came from work in artificial intelligence. Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms which can learn and make predictions on data. Such algorithms follow programmed instructions, but can also make predictions or decisions based on data. They build a model from sample inputs.\nMachine learning is done where designing and programming explicit algorithms cannot be done. Examples include spam filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical character recognition (OCR), search engines and computer vision.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computers","surface_form":"computers","offset":36},{"uri":"Learn","surface_form":"learn","offset":61},{"uri":"Arthur_Samuel","surface_form":"Arthur Samuel","offset":104},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":146},{"uri":"Artificial_intelligence","surface_form":"artificial intelligence","offset":191},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":272},{"uri":"Learning","surface_form":"learn","offset":293},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":323},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"programmed instruction","offset":352},{"uri":"Mathematical_model","surface_form":"model","offset":448},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":540},{"uri":"Spamming","surface_form":"spam filtering","offset":584},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":613},{"uri":"Optical_character_recognition","surface_form":"optical character recognition","offset":684},{"uri":"Search_engine","surface_form":"search engine","offset":721},{"uri":"Computer_vision","surface_form":"computer vision","offset":740}]}
