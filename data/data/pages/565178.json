{"id":565178,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_the_Moselle_department","text":"e=\"preserve\">There are 5 arrondissements in the Moselle department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into \"arrondissements\", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs'\"). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.\nIf the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.\nArrondissements are further divided into communes.\nHistory.\nMoselle is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was divided in nine districts: Metz, Bitche, Boulay, Briey, Longwy, Morhange, Sarreguemines, Sarrelouis and Thionville, with Metz as is capital.\nIn 1800, with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in France, the nine districts were changed into four \"arrondissements\": Metz, Briey, Sarreguemines and Thionville.\nThe Moselle department was eliminated in 1871 when part of the territory became part of Germany; the remaining parts were combined with the Meurthe department to form Meurthe-et-Moselle.\nIn 1919, a new department of Moselle was formed with nine \"arrondissements\". In 2015, four \"arrondissements\" were eliminated and their territories passed to the remaining five \"arrondissements\": Forbach-Boulay-Moselle, Metz, Sarrebourg-Ch\u00E2teau-Salins, Sarreguemines and Thionville.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Moselle","surface_form":"Moselle","offset":48},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":72},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":79},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"arrondissements","offset":134},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":221},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"subprefecture","offset":279},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":301},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"communes","offset":512},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":596},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":654},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":770},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"\"arrondissements\"","offset":813},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1034},{"uri":"Meurthe-et-Moselle","surface_form":"Meurthe-et-Moselle","offset":1113},{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territories","offset":1268}]}
