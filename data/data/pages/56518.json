{"id":56518,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxin","text":"=\"preserve\">A neurotoxin is a toxin that acts specifically on nerve cells \u2013 neurons \u2013 usually by interacting with membrane proteins and ion channels.\nMany of the venoms and other toxins that organisms use in defense against vertebrates are neurotoxins. A common effect is paralysis, which sets in extremely rapidly. The venom of bees, scorpions, pufferfish, spiders and snakes can contain many different toxins. Many neurotoxins act by affecting voltage-dependent ion channels.\nA man named Clairvius Narcisse was dead and came back to life again because the locals used neurotoxin on him to bring him back to life. He was buried in Haiti in 1964.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":30},{"uri":"Neuron","surface_form":"neuron","offset":76},{"uri":"Membrane_protein","surface_form":"membrane protein","offset":114},{"uri":"Ion_channel","surface_form":"ion channel","offset":136},{"uri":"Venom_(poison)","surface_form":"venoms","offset":162},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":224},{"uri":"Paralysis","surface_form":"paralysis","offset":272},{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bee","offset":329},{"uri":"Scorpion","surface_form":"scorpion","offset":335},{"uri":"Pufferfish","surface_form":"pufferfish","offset":346},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":358},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":370},{"uri":"Clairvius_Narcisse","surface_form":"Clairvius Narcisse","offset":490}]}
