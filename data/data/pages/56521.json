{"id":56521,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis","text":"Paralysis is the complete loss of muscle function for one or more muscle groups, when the thing that is paralysed cannot move.\nParalysis is most often caused by damage to the nervous system or brain, especially the spinal cord. Major causes are stroke, trauma, poliomyelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), botulism, spina bifida, multiple sclerosis, and Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome. Partial paralysis can also occur in the REM stage of sleep (see:Sleep paralysis). Paralysis often includes loss of feeling in the affected area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":34},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"move","offset":121},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":175},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":193},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":215},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":245},{"uri":"Physical_trauma","surface_form":"trauma","offset":253},{"uri":"Poliomyelitis","surface_form":"poliomyelitis","offset":261},{"uri":"Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","surface_form":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","offset":276},{"uri":"Botulism","surface_form":"botulism","offset":313},{"uri":"Spina_bifida","surface_form":"spina bifida","offset":323},{"uri":"Multiple_sclerosis","surface_form":"multiple sclerosis","offset":337},{"uri":"Guillain-Barr%C3%A9_syndrome","surface_form":"Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","offset":361},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":439},{"uri":"Sleep_paralysis","surface_form":"Sleep paralysis","offset":450}]}
