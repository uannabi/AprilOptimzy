She has appeared on CNN and Fox News. She has been a guest on shows like \"Good Morning America\" and \"Meet the Press\".\nOn August 1, 2016, Conway became the campaign manager for Donald Trump.\nSince Trump became president, Conway has had many problems. She said that there were \"alternative facts\" when talking about a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that never happened. She said that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was fired. Members of Congress from both parties asked for an investigation of ethics violations after she publicly endorsed the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump's commercial products. In June 2019, the US Office of Special Counsel said that Conway should be fired for breaking the Hatch Act of 1939.\nConway was born in Atco, New Jersey.\nIn October 2020, Conway tested positive for COVID-19.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":47},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":56},{"uri":"Campaign_manager","surface_form":"campaign manager","offset":67},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":88},{"uri":"CNN","surface_form":"CNN","offset":120},{"uri":"Fox_News","surface_form":"Fox News","offset":128},{"uri":"Good_Morning_America","surface_form":"Good Morning America","offset":174},{"uri":"Meet_the_Press","surface_form":"Meet the Press","offset":201},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":276},{"uri":"Alternative_facts","surface_form":"alternative facts","offset":376},{"uri":"Bowling_Green_massacre","surface_form":"Bowling Green massacre","offset":417},{"uri":"Michael_Flynn","surface_form":"Michael Flynn","offset":476},{"uri":"Ivanka_Trump","surface_form":"Ivanka Trump","offset":698},{"uri":"United_States_Office_of_Special_Counsel","surface_form":"US Office of Special Counsel","offset":752},{"uri":"Hatch_Act_of_1939","surface_form":"Hatch Act of 1939","offset":831},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":875},{"uri":"White_House_outbreak_of_COVID-19","surface_form":"Conway tested positive","offset":904},{"uri":"COVID-19","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":931}]}
