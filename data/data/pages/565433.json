{"id":565433,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_(boat)","text":"A cutter is typically a small, but in some cases a medium-sized, watercraft designed for speed rather than for capacity. Traditionally a cutter is a smaller sailing ship with a single mast. It is fore-and-aft rigged, with two or more headsails and often has a bowsprit. The cutter's mast may be set farther back than on a sloop.\nIn modern usage, a cutter can be either a small- or medium-sized ship whose occupants exercise official authority. Examples are harbor pilots' cutters and cutters of the U.S. Coast Guard or UK Border Force.\nCutters can also be a small boat serving a larger one to ferry passengers or light cargo between larger ships and the shore. This type of cutter may be powered by oars, sails or a motor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sailing_ship","surface_form":"sailing ship","offset":157},{"uri":"Mast","surface_form":"mast","offset":184},{"uri":"Fore-and-aft_rig","surface_form":"fore-and-aft rig","offset":196},{"uri":"Headsail","surface_form":"headsail","offset":234},{"uri":"Bowsprit","surface_form":"bowsprit","offset":260},{"uri":"Sloop","surface_form":"sloop","offset":322},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":394},{"uri":"Harbor_pilot","surface_form":"harbor pilot","offset":457},{"uri":"United_States_Coast_Guard","surface_form":"U.S. Coast Guard","offset":499},{"uri":"Border_Force","surface_form":"UK Border Force","offset":519},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":564},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":593},{"uri":"Passenger","surface_form":"passenger","offset":599},{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":619},{"uri":"Shore","surface_form":"shore","offset":654},{"uri":"Oar","surface_form":"oar","offset":699},{"uri":"Sail","surface_form":"sail","offset":705},{"uri":"Motor","surface_form":"motor","offset":716}]}
