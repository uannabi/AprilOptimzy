{"id":565443,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_wrap","text":"Plastic wrap (also cling wrap, food wrap, or clingfilm) is a thin plastic material. It is used for sealing food in containers. It keeps food fresh over a long period of time without spoiling. It is usually sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge.\nPlastic wrap was first made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). A common, cheaper alternative to PVC is low-density polyethylene (LDPE). LDPE doesn't stick to itself as well as PVC.\nIn the United States and Japan, Plastic wrap has sometimes been made of polyvinylidene chloride (PVdC). PVdC was the main ingredient in Saran Wrap, a popular brand of plastic wrap. Now, Saran Wrap is made with polyethylene.\nResearch shows that plastic wrapping of food is often not wasteful, because the food lasts longer. A study showed that only 3% of wrapped food was wasted in the UK, but up to 50% of food was wasted in an African country, where it was sold unwrapped.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":66},{"uri":"Polyvinyl_chloride","surface_form":"polyvinyl chloride","offset":283},{"uri":"Polyethylene","surface_form":"polyethylene","offset":361},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":434},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":452}]}
