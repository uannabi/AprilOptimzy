{"id":56551,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelus","text":"An obelus (plural, obeli) is a symbol of a line with dots above and below, formula_1, and is used to represent the division operation in mathematics. Because of that, this symbol is also known as a division sign.\nThe word \"obelus\" comes from the Greek word for a sharpened stick, spit, or pointed pillar. This is the same root as that of the word \"obelisk\". The obelus was first used as a symbol for division in 1659, in the algebra book \"Teutsche Algebra\" by Johann Rahn. Today, the obelus is used occasionally, mostly as a standalone symbol for the division operation itself (as on a calculator), or as an operator in elementary arithmetic. In most cases, division is now represented using other ways, often by a forward slash (/), also known as \"solidus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"division","offset":115},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":137},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":246},{"uri":"Obelisk","surface_form":"obelisk","offset":348},{"uri":"1659","surface_form":"1659","offset":412},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":425},{"uri":"Johann_Rahn","surface_form":"Johann Rahn","offset":460},{"uri":"Calculator","surface_form":"calculator","offset":586},{"uri":"Arithmetic","surface_form":"arithmetic","offset":631}]}
