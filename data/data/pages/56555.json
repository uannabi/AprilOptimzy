{"id":56555,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)","text":"The colon (\":\") is a punctuation mark, visually consisting of two equally sized dots centered on the same vertical (up/down) line.\nHistory.\nThe colon's first appearance in English text is marked by the \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" as 1589.\nDiacritical usage.\nA special double-triangle colon symbol is used in IPA to indicate that the preceding sound is long. Its form is that of two triangles, each a bit larger than a point of a standard colon, pointing toward each other. It is available in Unicode as modifier letter triangular colon, Unicode U+02D0 (). A regular colon is often used as a fallback when this character is not available, or in the practical orthography of some languages (particularly in Mexico), which have a phonemic long/short distinction in vowels.\nMathematics.\nThe colon is also used in mathematics, cartography, model building and other fields to denote a ratio or a scale, as in 3:1 (pronounced \"three to one\"). A betting odd of the form formula_1 corresponds to the probability formula_1. Unicode provides a distinct ratio character, Unicode U+2236 () for mathematical usage.\nIn many non-English-speaking countries, the colon is used as a division sign: \"a divided by b\" is written as \"a\u00A0:\u00A0b\".\nThe combination with an equal sign, formula_1, is used for definitions.\nComputing.\nIn computing, the colon character is represented by ASCII code 58, and is located at Unicode code-point U+003A. The full-width (double-byte) equivalent, \uFF1A, is located at Unicode code point U+FF1A.\nThe colon is quite often used as a special control character in many operating systems commands, URLs, computer programming languages, and in the path representation of several file systems. It is often used as a single post-fix delimiter, signifying the immediate precedence of a token keyword or the transition from one mode of character string interpretation to another related mode. Some applications, such as the widely used MediaWiki, use the colon as both a pre-fix and post-fix delimiter.\nFor a double-colon, \"::\" the meaning has included the use of ellipsis, as spanning over omitted text; however, there have been other meanings as well.\nInternet usage.\nColons may also be used for sounds (as with \":Click:\"). One can contrast this use with the use of outer asterisks (for example, *cough* would denote that the speaker is coughing, as opposed to saying the word 'cough').\nIt also has the widespread usage of representing two vertically aligned eyes in a emoticon, such as:-),:(:P,:D,:3, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The","surface_form":"The","offset":0},{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"punctuation","offset":21},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":283},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"IPA","offset":316},{"uri":"Length_(phonetics)","surface_form":"long","offset":360},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":500},{"uri":"Orthography","surface_form":"orthography","offset":666},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":817},{"uri":"Cartography","surface_form":"cartography","offset":830},{"uri":"Scale_model","surface_form":"model building","offset":843},{"uri":"Ratio","surface_form":"ratio","offset":887},{"uri":"Scale_(ratio)","surface_form":"scale","offset":898},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":1022},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":1286},{"uri":"Computing","surface_form":"computing","offset":1313},{"uri":"Character_(computing)","surface_form":"character","offset":1334},{"uri":"ASCII","surface_form":"ASCII","offset":1362},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":1395},{"uri":"Universal_Character_Set","surface_form":"code-point","offset":1403},{"uri":"Control_character","surface_form":"control character","offset":1550},{"uri":"URL","surface_form":"URL","offset":1604},{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"computer programming","offset":1610},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"languages","offset":1631},{"uri":"Path_(computing)","surface_form":"path representation","offset":1653},{"uri":"File_system","surface_form":"file system","offset":1684},{"uri":"Delimiter","surface_form":"delimiter","offset":1736},{"uri":"MediaWiki","surface_form":"MediaWiki","offset":1937},{"uri":"Ellipsis","surface_form":"ellipsis","offset":2065},{"uri":"Asterisk","surface_form":"asterisk","offset":2275},{"uri":"Emoticon","surface_form":"emoticon","offset":2472}]}
