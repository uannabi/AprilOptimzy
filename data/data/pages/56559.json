{"id":56559,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_Never_Knows","text":"Tomorrow Never Knows is a song from The Beatles's \"Revolver\" album, from 1966.\nJohn Lennon wrote the song based on his readings of \"The Psychedelic Experience\", which adapted the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" for use as an LSD \"user's manual\", intending to give users a kind of religious experience. The song's title came from his bandmate Ringo Starr, who was known for his but insightful comments about life.\nLennon wanted the sound of monks, to complement the Beatles' recording of the song. It was not possible to do this, but Lennon's voice was played through a special speaker (called a Leslie speaker), to give it a sound, like a voice calling from a hilltop. Other sounds on the record came from tape loops, playing over and over, and from a sitar.\nThe song has also been recorded by other artists. A dance cover version appeared in the 1990s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":36},{"uri":"Revolver_(album)","surface_form":"Revolver","offset":51},{"uri":"1966","surface_form":"1966","offset":73},{"uri":"John_Lennon","surface_form":"John Lennon","offset":79},{"uri":"Tibetan_Book_of_the_Dead","surface_form":"Tibetan Book of the Dead","offset":180},{"uri":"Lysergic_acid_diethylamide","surface_form":"LSD","offset":220},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":275},{"uri":"Ringo_Starr","surface_form":"Ringo Starr","offset":337},{"uri":"Insight","surface_form":"insightful","offset":376},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":435},{"uri":"Complement","surface_form":"complement","offset":445},{"uri":"Vinyl_record","surface_form":"recording","offset":469},{"uri":"Compact_Cassette","surface_form":"tape","offset":701},{"uri":"Sitar","surface_form":"sitar","offset":747},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":806},{"uri":"Cover_version","surface_form":"cover version","offset":812}]}
