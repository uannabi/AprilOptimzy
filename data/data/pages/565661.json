{"id":565661,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestay","text":"On a sailing vessel, a forestay, sometimes called a jibstay, or a headstay, is a piece of standing rigging. It keeps a mast from falling backwards. It is usually attached to the very top of the mast. The other end of the forestay is attached to the bow of the boat.\nOften a sail is attached to the forestay. This sail may be a jib or a genoa. In a cutter rig, the jib or jibs are flown from stays in front of the forestay, perhaps going from the masthead to a bowsprit. The sail on the forestay is then referred to as the staysail. A forestay might be made from stainless steel wire or rod.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sailing","surface_form":"sailing","offset":5},{"uri":"Standing_rigging","surface_form":"standing rigging","offset":90},{"uri":"Mast","surface_form":"mast","offset":119},{"uri":"Bow_(ship)","surface_form":"bow","offset":249},{"uri":"Sail","surface_form":"sail","offset":274},{"uri":"Jib","surface_form":"jib","offset":327},{"uri":"Genoa_(sail)","surface_form":"genoa","offset":336},{"uri":"Cutter_(ship)","surface_form":"cutter","offset":348},{"uri":"Bowsprit","surface_form":"bowsprit","offset":460},{"uri":"Staysail_(sail)","surface_form":"staysail","offset":522},{"uri":"Stainless_steel","surface_form":"stainless steel","offset":562},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":578},{"uri":"Rod_(geometry)","surface_form":"rod","offset":586}]}
