One of the 18 camps for detained Bosniaks from the Kotor Varo\u0161 Municipality was at the Police station (MUP) in \u0160iprage.\nAfter 1996, most of the Bosniak villages were partly restored thanks to the Luxembourgish government. During the war, an Orthodox church was built in the centre of the village.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":41},{"uri":"Republika_Srpska","surface_form":"Republika Srpska","offset":65},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":90},{"uri":"Kotor_(fortress)","surface_form":"Kotor","offset":171},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":368},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":433},{"uri":"Bosnian_War","surface_form":"Bosnian War","offset":464},{"uri":"Kru%C5%A1evo_Brdo","surface_form":"Kru\u0161evo Brdo","offset":572},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":637},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":782}]}
