{"id":565708,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilomska","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ilomska (\u0418\u043B\u043E\u043C\u0441\u043A\u0430) is a river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is right tributary of the Ugar. It is about in length. The river starts in Vla\u0161i\u0107's Mountain. It is an essential body of water for surrounding wildlife.\nIlomska flows between the \u017De\u017Eni\u010Dka Greda (altitude) and Javorak () mountains. It has a curved flow around Lisina () and Runjavica () mountains, through coniferous (fir and spruce) and mixed spuce-beech woods.\nIts flow below Petrovo polje has sharp curves.\nAfter two attractive waterfalls, Ilomska flows into the Ugar, a few kilometers downstream from Vitovlje village. The height of the bigger water flow is around 40 meters. Waterfalls in this wildness attract mountain-climbers, tourists, and fishermen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":45},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":81},{"uri":"Ugar_(river)","surface_form":"Ugar","offset":98},{"uri":"Vla%C5%A1i%C4%87_(mountain)","surface_form":"Vla\u0161i\u0107","offset":147},{"uri":"%C5%BDe%C5%BEni%C4%8Dka_Greda","surface_form":"\u017De\u017Eni\u010Dka Greda","offset":251},{"uri":"Javorak","surface_form":"Javorak","offset":281},{"uri":"Mountains","surface_form":"mountains","offset":292},{"uri":"Lisina","surface_form":"Lisina","offset":331},{"uri":"Runjavica","surface_form":"Runjavica","offset":345},{"uri":"Fir","surface_form":"fir","offset":389},{"uri":"Spruce","surface_form":"spruce","offset":397},{"uri":"Beech","surface_form":"beech","offset":421},{"uri":"Petrovo_field%2C_Croatia","surface_form":"Petrovo polje","offset":449},{"uri":"Vitovlje","surface_form":"Vitovlje","offset":576}]}
