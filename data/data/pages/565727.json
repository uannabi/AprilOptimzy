{"id":565727,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosniaks","text":"The Bosniaks (Bo\u0161njaci/\u0411\u043E\u0448\u045A\u0430\u0446\u0438, feminine: \"Bo\u0161njakinja\"/\u0411\u043E\u0448\u045A\u0430\u043A\u0438\u045A\u0430) are South Slavic nation and ethnic group. They come from Old Bosnia, which is today Bosnia and Herzegovina, though many of them are from the other Balkan populations, especially Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia. They come from medieval Bosnians or Bo\u0161njani, Slavic that lived in what was then Bosnia. Medieval Bosniaks or Bosnians (called Dobri bo\u0161njani = \"Good Bosnians\") practiced different religions but they all spoke the Bosnian language. Today, Bosniaks are mostly Bosnian-speaking, and write in the Latin alphabet or Cyrillic alphabet. Most modern Bosniaks are Muslims, and some are agnostic and atheists. They have both European and Islamic heritage. Both within the Balkans region and throughout the world, Bosniaks are often noted for their unique culture, which has been influenced by both eastern and western civilizations and schools of thought over the course of their history.\nAll Slavic languages use the suffix \"-ak\" for masculine nouns. For example, people from the ethnic group in Poland can be called \"Polak\" and people from Slovakia Slovaks (\"Slov\u00E1k\"). Consequently, \"Bosniak\" is logic equivalent to its non-ethnic counterpart \"Bosnian,\" which came to English from Middle French as \"Bosnien\"): a native of Bosnia.\nEnglish-speakers usually say \"Bosnian Muslims\" when they mean Bosniaks, but this is not completely correct because not all Bosniaks are Muslims. Partly because of this, ever since the country Yugoslavia broke up, people have started to say \"Bosniak\" instead of \"Muslim\" as an official way to talk about this group of people ethnic term to avoid confusion. They also say \"Bosnians\", but this word can mean anyone from Bosnia or Herzegovina, not just members of the Bosniak ethnic group.\nA few million Bosniaks live in the Balkans, and about one million other Bosniaks live in other parts of the world. Ethnic cleansing and genocide during World War II (1939-1945) and the Bosnian War (1993\u201395) killed many Bosniaks and drove others to move away from where they had been living. Partially because of this this, there has been a Bosniak diaspora in a number of countries, including Bosnian Austrians, Germany, Bosnian Australians, Sweden, Turkey, Canada, and the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slavs","surface_form":"South Slavic","offset":71},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":84},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":95},{"uri":"Bosnia","surface_form":"Bosnia","offset":128},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":151},{"uri":"Balkans","surface_form":"Balkan","offset":214},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":245},{"uri":"Montenegro","surface_form":"Montenegro","offset":253},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":268},{"uri":"Bosnia","surface_form":"Bo\u0161njani","offset":313},{"uri":"Slavs","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":323},{"uri":"Bosnian_language","surface_form":"Bosnian-speaking","offset":536},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":571},{"uri":"Cyrillic","surface_form":"Cyrillic alphabet","offset":589},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":633},{"uri":"Agnosticism","surface_form":"agnostic","offset":655},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheists","offset":668},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"European","offset":693},{"uri":"Slavs","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":961},{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":986},{"uri":"Slovaks","surface_form":"Slovaks","offset":1119},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1300},{"uri":"Balkans","surface_form":"Balkans","offset":1821},{"uri":"Ethnic_cleansing","surface_form":"Ethnic cleansing","offset":1901},{"uri":"Genocide","surface_form":"genocide","offset":1922},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1938},{"uri":"Bosnian_War","surface_form":"Bosnian War","offset":1971},{"uri":"Diaspora","surface_form":"diaspora","offset":2134},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Bosnian Austrians","offset":2179},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":2198},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Bosnian Australians","offset":2207},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":2228},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":2236},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":2244},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2260}]}
