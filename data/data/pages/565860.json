{"id":565860,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kru%C5%A1evo_Brdo","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kru\u0161evo Brdo is a village in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It belongs to the Municipality of Kotor Varo\u0161. It is divided into Kr\u0161evo Brdo I and II for administration.\nThis village is located at the beginning of the valley of the Vrbanja river. It is on the northeastern slopes of the Vla\u0161i\u0107 mountain. It is km to \u0160iprage and to Kotor-Varo\u0161. The valley spreads along the Vrbanja river to its estuary in Vrbas (Banja Luka). The Ilomska river is north of Kru\u0161evo Brdo. All local roads descend into this place.\nDuring the Bosnian War (1992\u201395), Bosnian Serb Police and Army forces destroyed Bosniaks's villages downstream along the Vrbanja from Kru\u0161evo Brdo, via \u0160iprage, and Kotor Varo\u0161 to Banja Luka. After 1996, most of the Bosniak's villages were partly restored thanks to the Luxembourgish government.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":50},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":108},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":243},{"uri":"Vla%C5%A1i%C4%87_(mountain)","surface_form":"Vla\u0161i\u0107","offset":298},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":327},{"uri":"Kotor-Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor-Varo\u0161","offset":342},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":405},{"uri":"Vrbas_(river)","surface_form":"Vrbas","offset":416},{"uri":"Banja_Luka","surface_form":"Banja Luka","offset":423},{"uri":"Ilomska","surface_form":"Ilomska","offset":440},{"uri":"Bosnian_War","surface_form":"Bosnian War","offset":532},{"uri":"Bosniaks","surface_form":"Bosniaks","offset":601},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":673},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":686},{"uri":"Banja_Luka","surface_form":"Banja Luka","offset":701},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":791}]}
