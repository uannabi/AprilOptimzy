He was born in Collyhurst, Manchester.\nCareer.\nStiles played for England for five years, winning 28 caps and scoring 1 goal. He played every minute of England's victorious 1966 FIFA World Cup campaign. His best performance in an England shirt was probably the semi-final of that tournament against Portugal, where he was given the job of marking the prolific Eus\u00E9bio. His tough performance resulted in Eus\u00E9bio being practically nullified for the entire game.\nStiles also played very well in the final, which England won 4\u20132 against West Germany. His post-match celebration has become one of the most famous images in English sport history. The sight of Stiles dancing on the Wembley pitch, holding the World Cup trophy in one hand and his false teeth in the other, has lived for decades.\nDeath.\nOn 24 November 2013, it was announced that Stiles was diagnosed with prostate cancer.\nStiles died on 30 October 2020 after suffering with prostate cancer and advanced dementia in Manchester, aged 78.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"MBE","offset":29},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":74},{"uri":"Collyhurst","surface_form":"Collyhurst","offset":109},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":121},{"uri":"England_national_football_team","surface_form":"England","offset":159},{"uri":"1966_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"1966 FIFA World Cup","offset":266},{"uri":"Portugal_national_football_team","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":392},{"uri":"Eus%C3%A9bio","surface_form":"Eus\u00E9bio","offset":453},{"uri":"1966_FIFA_World_Cup_Final","surface_form":"final","offset":589},{"uri":"Germany_national_football_team","surface_form":"West Germany","offset":626},{"uri":"Wembley_Stadium_(1923)","surface_form":"Wembley","offset":769},{"uri":"Prostate_cancer","surface_form":"prostate cancer","offset":958},{"uri":"Dementia","surface_form":"dementia","offset":1056}]}
