It is in the Kotor Varo\u0161 Municipality in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It spreads across Ve\u010Di\u0107ko polje (Ve\u010Di\u0107i's field), nearby the mouth of Cvrcka (in Vrbanja river), and Vrbanjci, a larger village.\nIn 1991 its population was 1744. In 2013 it was 797, all of whom are Bosniaks.\nDuring the Bosnian War, the village was a pocket of Bosniak resistance against the Bosnian Serb Army and Police forces. It suffered severe damages, including destruction of the village mosque. The anthropologist Madelyn Iris noted that\nSome of the villagers died in a massacre at nearby Grabovica in November 1992 and 150-200 men and boys were killed in the village school. As of 2017 these people are still on the list of missing persons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":23},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":60},{"uri":"Ve%C4%8Di%C4%87ko_polje","surface_form":"Ve\u010Di\u0107ko polje","offset":138},{"uri":"Cvrcka","surface_form":"Cvrcka","offset":190},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":201},{"uri":"Vrbanjci","surface_form":"Vrbanjci","offset":221},{"uri":"Bosniaks","surface_form":"Bosniaks","offset":318},{"uri":"Bosnian_War","surface_form":"Bosnian War","offset":339},{"uri":"Resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":388},{"uri":"Serbs","surface_form":"Bosnian Serb","offset":411},{"uri":"Mosque","surface_form":"mosque","offset":513},{"uri":"Anthropologist","surface_form":"anthropologist","offset":525},{"uri":"Grabovica_(Kotor_Varo%C5%A1)","surface_form":"Grabovica","offset":615},{"uri":"Missing_person","surface_form":"missing person","offset":751}]}
