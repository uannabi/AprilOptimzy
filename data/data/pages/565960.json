According to the historical context, it probably happened around 1463, when Bosnia fell under Ottoman Administration.\nDuring the last War in Bosnia (1992\u20131995), Serb paramilitary and police forces have committed severe crimes against the civilian Bosniaks and Croats populations in Vrbanjaca and surrounding villages, including Ve\u010Di\u0107i\nMost of the refugees of the Bosniak population are back in their native lands and have restored their houses, with the assistance of the international community, but above all thanks to their own resources.\nSince 1995, parents of Bosniak's pupils at the local Elementary school \"Sveti Sava\" have been running a leongly court case to exercise their Constitutional right to teach in their native Bosnian language. Following a decade-long denial of the lawsuit at the Municipal Court in Kotor Varo\u0161 and the District Court in Banja Luka, the Constitutional Court of RS issued a verdict in their favor only in December 2019, obliging the defendant to reimburse all costs of the trial.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":29},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":76},{"uri":"Republika_Srpska","surface_form":"Republika Srpska","offset":89},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":144},{"uri":"Jezerka","surface_form":"Jezerka","offset":207},{"uri":"Bosanka_(river)","surface_form":"Bosanka","offset":216},{"uri":"Cvrcka","surface_form":"Cvrcka","offset":229},{"uri":"Ve%C4%8Di%C4%87i","surface_form":"Ve\u010Di\u0107i","offset":311},{"uri":"Ottomans","surface_form":"Ottomans","offset":373},{"uri":"Bosnia","surface_form":"Bosnia","offset":453},{"uri":"War_in_Bosnia","surface_form":"War in Bosnia","offset":595},{"uri":"Ve%C4%8Di%C4%87i","surface_form":"Ve\u010Di\u0107i","offset":789},{"uri":"Bosniak","surface_form":"Bosniak","offset":1026},{"uri":"Bosnian_language","surface_form":"Bosnian language","offset":1190},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":1280},{"uri":"Banja_Luka","surface_form":"Banja Luka","offset":1318}]}
