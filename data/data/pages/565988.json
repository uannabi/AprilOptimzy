{"id":565988,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usora_(river)","text":"Usora is left tributary of the Bosnia in central Bosnia. The total length of the river Usora \u2013 from sources below the top of the mountain O\u010Dau\u0161 to the mouth above the Doboj is about 82 kilometers. The town of Tesli\u0107, through which it flows, bears the local name Velika Usora (Great Usora), since under the city at a place called Sastavci meets with his same named, but a lot less left tributary Mala Usora (Little Usora). It also comes from the mountain masiff Uzlomac \u2013 Borja \u2013 O\u010Dau\u0161 below it in smaller distances rises more Bosnia river and their tributaries, as well as the basin Vrbanja river and Ukrina. In its upper reaches, the river makes a wide loop around Borja, from its southwest to northeast slopes.\nGreat Usora created by merging Gomjenice and Brki\u0107a stream. Small Usora springs below (south) of the main road M-4 (Banja Luka \u2013 Matuzi\u0107i, some 10\u00A0km west of Pribini\u0107). Before Sastavci locality, right tributary to it are: Mi\u0161i\u0107a rijeka, Great Ostru\u017Enja, Inova, Miljkova\u010Da, Velika rijeka (Great river), Brezna and smaller streams, as well as left: Rankovi\u0107a rijeka, and Gra\u010Danica.\nIn much of the flow Ukrina is flooding river but the increasingly frequent flooding causes significant damages.\nIn the early Bosnian history Usora belonged to gold-bearing river, and it is believed that this is still in its upper course along with the many large and small tributaries and streams. Obvious hydro-energy potential Usora is permanently unused, and fish stocks almost negligible, especially if one takes into account the centuries-old discharging untreated waste industrial water Chemical Distillation of wood in Tesli\u0107.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":14},{"uri":"Bosnia_(river)","surface_form":"Bosnia","offset":31},{"uri":"Bosnia","surface_form":"Bosnia","offset":49},{"uri":"O%C4%8Dau%C5%A1","surface_form":"O\u010Dau\u0161","offset":138},{"uri":"Doboj","surface_form":"Doboj","offset":167},{"uri":"Tesli%C4%87","surface_form":"Tesli\u0107","offset":209},{"uri":"Uzlomac","surface_form":"Uzlomac","offset":461},{"uri":"Borja","surface_form":"Borja","offset":471},{"uri":"O%C4%8Dau%C5%A1","surface_form":"O\u010Dau\u0161","offset":479},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":583},{"uri":"Ukrina_(river)","surface_form":"Ukrina","offset":601},{"uri":"Banja_Luka","surface_form":"Banja Luka","offset":829},{"uri":"Matuzi%C4%87i","surface_form":"Matuzi\u0107i","offset":842},{"uri":"Pribini%C4%87","surface_form":"Pribini\u0107","offset":871},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industrial","offset":1569},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"Chemical","offset":1586}]}
