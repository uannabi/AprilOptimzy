{"id":56616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery%2C_London","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The National Gallery, London is an art gallery in London, England, which has one of the finest collections of European paintings in the world.\nWhat makes this gallery so important is that, although there are bigger galleries, \"The National Gallery\" has many paintings of very high quality and also because it has paintings by famous artists whose works are very rare. These rare paintings include works by Duccio, Masaccio, Uccello, Piero della Francesca, Leonardo, Giorgione, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Vermeer, Chardin, Klimt, Rousseau and Redon.\n\"The National Gallery\" is on Trafalgar Square, which is one of the busiest tourist places in London. It is a grand building of pale grey limestone, with a central dome and a large Classical style porch (\"portico\") like an Ancient Greek temple. To the left side, the gallery has a large new building called \"The Sainsbury Wing\".\nHistory.\nIn 1823 a collector called Sir George Beaumont offered to give his famous collection of paintings to the British Government to start a public art gallery. In 1824 another famous collection of paintings was on sale. The owner, John Julius Angerstein, had died. It looked as if his paintings would be sold outside England. Then there was another offer of paintings from a third collector, The Reverend Holwell Carr. The Parliament had to make a quick decision.\nThe Parliament voted that a national collection should be started and a gallery should be built. They gave 60,000 Pounds Sterling to buy the Angerstein paintings. They got 38 pictures and were able to display them publicly in the Angerstein House.\nThe collection grew quickly with the Beaumont and Holwell Carr paintings, and others, being bought or given. A new gallery was needed. In 1831 the plans of the architect William Wilkins were accepted. The site which looks over Trafalgar Square was chosen, old buildings were demolished and the magnificent new gallery was opened on April 9, 1838.\nWhen \"the National Gallery\" opened, there was a strong opinion that paintings of the High Renaissance period of the late 1400s to Baroque paintings of the 1600s were the finest type of art. The word \"primitive\" was used to describe Italian paintings from the 1300s and early 1400s. Luckily, the director of the Gallery, Sir Charles Eastlake, thought it was important to collect some of these \"primitive\" paintings, as well as the more popular High Renaissance paintings. That is how the \"National Gallery\" came to own so many very rare works from the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance periods.\nIn the 1870s the Gallery was lucky to get two collections of paintings by famous Dutch artists. The building had to be made larger to house them. The Gallery was also given paintings by famous British artists; soon there were so many that most of them were moved out to a new gallery called the Tate.\nBy the 20th century, it was getting more difficult to buy very important paintings; there were other galleries in the United States and Germany who were trying to buy the same paintings. So the \"National Gallery\" began to buy works by more modern painters and soon had a collection of 19th and early 20th century paintings. This is not a large part of the \"National Gallery's\" collection, but it does show small works by many very important artists, particularly the Impressionists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":64},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":72},{"uri":"Duccio","surface_form":"Duccio","offset":420},{"uri":"Masaccio","surface_form":"Masaccio","offset":428},{"uri":"Uccello","surface_form":"Uccello","offset":438},{"uri":"Piero_della_Francesca","surface_form":"Piero della Francesca","offset":447},{"uri":"Leonardo","surface_form":"Leonardo","offset":470},{"uri":"Giorgione","surface_form":"Giorgione","offset":480},{"uri":"Michelangelo","surface_form":"Michelangelo","offset":491},{"uri":"Caravaggio","surface_form":"Caravaggio","offset":505},{"uri":"Vermeer","surface_form":"Vermeer","offset":517},{"uri":"Chardin","surface_form":"Chardin","offset":526},{"uri":"Klimt","surface_form":"Klimt","offset":535},{"uri":"Douanier_Rousseau","surface_form":"Rousseau","offset":542},{"uri":"Odilon_Redon","surface_form":"Redon","offset":555},{"uri":"Trafalgar_Square","surface_form":"Trafalgar Square","offset":591},{"uri":"Dome","surface_form":"dome","offset":725},{"uri":"Parthenon","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":784},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"Government","offset":1012},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":1317},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":1362},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":1766},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":2043},{"uri":"Baroque","surface_form":"Baroque","offset":2083},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":2509},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":2531},{"uri":"Tate","surface_form":"Tate","offset":2847},{"uri":"Impressionists","surface_form":"Impressionists","offset":3320}]}
