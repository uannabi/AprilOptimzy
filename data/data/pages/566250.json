Also, in 2009, Deathstroke was ranked as IGN's 32nd greatest comic book villain of all time.\nOriginally the archenemy of the Teen Titans, writers have developed him over the years as a villain of other heroes in the DC Universe; parallels have been established between him and Batman, and he has a deep-seated grudge against Green Arrow. The character has been adapted from the comics into multiple forms of media, including several \"Batman\" related projects and the \"Teen Titans\" animated series.\nDeathstroke later appeared on The CW's live action TV series \"Arrow\", where he is portrayed by Manu Bennett.
