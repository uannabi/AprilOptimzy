What feelings then\"\n\"Filled every bosom, when the mariners,\"\n\"After the peril of that weary way,\"\n\"Beheld their own dear country ! Here stands one,\"\n\"Stretching his sight toward the distant shore,\"\n\"And, as to well known forms his busy joy\"\n\"Shapes the dim outline, eagerly he points\"\n\"The fancied headland and the cape and bay,\"\nThe poem was reviewed in \"The Poetical Register, and Repository of Fugitive Poetry\".\nIrish poet Paul Muldoon named his book \"Madoc: A Mystery\" (1990) after Robert Southey's poem.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Robert_Southey","surface_form":"Robert Southey","offset":24},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":339},{"uri":"Blank_verse","surface_form":"Blank verse","offset":492},{"uri":"Iambic_pentameter","surface_form":"iambic pentameter","offset":524}]}
