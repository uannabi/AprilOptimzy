{"id":566324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_the_Bouches-du-Rh%C3%B4ne_department","text":"e=\"preserve\">There are 4 arrondissements in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00F4ne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into \"arrondissements\", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs'\"). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.\nIf the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.\nArrondissements are further divided into communes.\nHistory.\nBouches-du-Rh\u00F4ne is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was divided in six districts: Tarascon, Apt, Aix, Marseille, Salon and Arles, with Aix as is capital.\nIn 1800, with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in France, the six districts were changed into three \"arrondissements\": Marseille, Aix and Tarascon. The prefecture was moved from Aix to Marseille.\nIn 1817, the subprefecture of Tarascon was moved to Arles. The \"arrondissement\" of Istres was created in 1981.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bouches-du-Rh%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Bouches-du-Rh\u00F4ne","offset":48},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":81},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":88},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"arrondissements","offset":143},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":230},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"subprefecture","offset":288},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":310},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"communes","offset":521},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":614},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":671},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":745},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"\"arrondissements\"","offset":788},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":911}]}
