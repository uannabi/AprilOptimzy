{"id":566464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics","text":"Robotics is a part of engineering and science. It has to do with the creation and building of robots, as well as computer programming. It is interdisciplinary, using mechanical, electrical and other kinds of engineering. Robots are sometimes used to do things that humans cannot, like finding and destroying bomb<nowiki/>s, or going places that are too hot, small, dangerous or distant for humans. Some robots look like humans, but most just look like machines.\nRobotics comes from the word robot, which in turn comes from the Slavic word \"robota\". \"Robota\" means labor, or work. Karel \u010Capek invented the word \"robot\" to use in a play. This play was called \"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)\". The word \"robotics\" was first used by Isaac Asimov in his story \"Liar!\" published in 1941.\nSimulacrum of Robotics.\nAlyosha (callsign\uFF1AMPM-100) - Simulacrum of the Robonaut.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":22},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":38},{"uri":"Robot","surface_form":"robot","offset":94},{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"computer programming","offset":113},{"uri":"Interdisciplinary","surface_form":"interdisciplinary","offset":141},{"uri":"Robot","surface_form":"Robot","offset":221},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":308},{"uri":"Robot","surface_form":"robot","offset":491},{"uri":"Robonaut","surface_form":"Robonaut","offset":857}]}
