He was notable for his role in the deaths of three humans, including two trainers. The first death, in 1991, was a trainer at the Sealand of the Pacific in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. In 1992, he was moved to SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, United States. In 1999, Tilikum killed a trespasser in his inclosure. In 2010, Tilikum killed trainer Dawn Brancheau. This would lead to the documentary movie \"Blackfish\" being based on Tilikum.\nBorn in 1981, Tilikum was captured in 1983 at Hafnarfj\u00F6r\u00F0ur, near Reykjav\u00EDk, Iceland.\nTilikum died on January 6, 2017 at SeaWorld Orlando of a bacterial infection, aged 35.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Killer_whale","surface_form":"killer whale","offset":62},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":127},{"uri":"Sealand_of_the_Pacific","surface_form":"Sealand of the Pacific","offset":206},{"uri":"Victoria%2C_British_Columbia","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":232},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":242},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":260},{"uri":"SeaWorld_Orlando","surface_form":"SeaWorld","offset":293},{"uri":"Orlando%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Orlando","offset":305},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":314},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":323},{"uri":"Dawn_Brancheau","surface_form":"Dawn Brancheau","offset":425},{"uri":"Documentary","surface_form":"documentary","offset":464},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":476},{"uri":"Blackfish_(movie)","surface_form":"Blackfish","offset":483},{"uri":"Hafnarfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur","surface_form":"Hafnarfj\u00F6r\u00F0ur","offset":564},{"uri":"Reykjav%C3%ADk","surface_form":"Reykjav\u00EDk","offset":584},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":595},{"uri":"Bacterial","surface_form":"bacterial","offset":661},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":671}]}
