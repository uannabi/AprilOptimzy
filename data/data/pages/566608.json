{"id":566608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Wichterle","text":"e=\"preserve\">Otto Wichterle (27 October 1913 Prost\u011Bjov\u00A0now in the\u00A0Czech Republic\u00A0\u2013 18 August 1998) was a\u00A0Czech\u00A0chemist known for his invention of modern soft\u00A0contact lenses.\nLife.\nHe decided to be a chemist after his father, which co-owned a farm machine factory. He graduated from high school in Prost\u011Bjov and then he studied at the Chemical and Technological Faculty of the\u00A0Czech Technical University. After he got his diploma he wanted to continue in his studies, but the Protectorate regime didn't let him do so. Fortunately, he could continue in his scientific work because he was able to take part in the research institute at\u00A0Ba\u0165a's works in\u00A0Zl\u00EDn. His team made the first\u00A0Czechoslovak\u00A0synthetic fiber\u00A0called\u00A0\"silon.\" He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1942 but was released few months later. After\u00A0World War II he\u00A0returned to the university and started teaching general and inorganic chemistry. He wrote an inorganic chemistry textbook and German and Czech organic chemistry textbook. In 1952 he was made the dean of the Institute of Chemical Technology\u00A0in Prague.\nDevelopment of contact lenses.\nOtto studied the synthesis of cross-linking hydrophilous gels. He wanted to find a perfect material that can be in permanent contact with living tissue<nowiki/>s. His colleague\u00A0Drahoslav L\u00EDm helped him and together they prepared a gel. This gel absorbed up to 40% of water and was transparent. This new material is the\u00A0Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). They patented it in 1953. Wichterle thought that it might be a good material for contact lenses and gained his first patent for soft contact lenses. In 1957 Wichterle produced around 100 soft lenses. The problem was that the edges tore when the lens was getting removed. He wanted to find a better way to make them. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the Institute of Chemical Technology because\u00A0of its Communist\u00A0leadership in 1958. So the research at the Institute came to an end, but he did the important experiments to transform hydrogels into a good shape of a contact lens by himself at home.\nBy late 1961 produced the first four hydrogel\u00A0contact lenses\u00A0on a home-made apparatus built from children's building kit (Merkur). All the glass tubing was also made by himself. On Christmas afternoon he finally made a contact lens in his apparatus. He tried the lenses in his own eyes. He said that they were comfortable. He built more new prototype machines using\u00A0[http://www.merkurtoys.cz/en/wichterle-machine-prototype-of-merkur Merkur toys] \u00A0with stronger motor taken from his gramophone. With these devices he made 5,500 lenses.\nAchievements and legacy.\nWichterle was well-known all around the world not only because of his achievements but also because of his activities in international organizations. He is the author of a large number of studies. He is the author or co-author of approximately 180 patents and of over 200 publications.\nIn 1970, Wichterle was expelled again from his position in the institute, this time for signing \"The Two Thousand Words\". Full recognition did not come until the\u00A0Velvet Revolution\u00A0in 1989. In 1990, he was made president of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and was the honorary president of the\u00A0Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic\u00A0after that. Wichterle was a member of a number of foreign academies of science, he received many awards and honorary doctorates from several universities.\nThe\u00A0asteroid\u00A0number\u00A03899\u00A0was named after Wichterle in 1993. A high school in\u00A0Ostrava\u00A0was named after him on September 1, 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prost%C4%9Bjov","surface_form":"Prost\u011Bjov","offset":45},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":66},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czech","offset":105},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemist","offset":111},{"uri":"Contact_lens","surface_form":"contact lenses.","offset":158},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":242},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":247},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduated","offset":267},{"uri":"Prost%C4%9Bjov","surface_form":"Prost\u011Bjov","offset":297},{"uri":"Faculty_of_Chemical_Technology","surface_form":"Chemical and Technological Faculty","offset":334},{"uri":"Czech_Technical_University_in_Prague","surface_form":"Czech Technical University","offset":376},{"uri":"Protectorate","surface_form":"Protectorate","offset":475},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":611},{"uri":"Institution","surface_form":"institute","offset":620},{"uri":"Bata_Shoes","surface_form":"Ba\u0165a","offset":633},{"uri":"Zl%C3%ADn","surface_form":"Zl\u00EDn","offset":649},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovak","offset":679},{"uri":"Synthetic_fiber","surface_form":"synthetic fiber","offset":692},{"uri":"Gestapo","surface_form":"Gestapo","offset":747},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":804},{"uri":"General_chemistry","surface_form":"general","offset":868},{"uri":"Inorganic_chemistry","surface_form":"inorganic chemistry","offset":880},{"uri":"Textbook","surface_form":"textbook","offset":933},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":946},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech","offset":957},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":963},{"uri":"Dean_(education)","surface_form":"dean","offset":1015},{"uri":"University_of_Chemistry_and_Technology%2C_Prague","surface_form":"I","offset":1027},{"uri":"University_of_Chemistry_and_Technology%2C_Prague","surface_form":"nstitute of Chemical Technology","offset":1028},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":1063},{"uri":"Synthesis","surface_form":"synthesis","offset":1119},{"uri":"Cross-link","surface_form":"cross-linking","offset":1132},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":1193},{"uri":"Tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":1247},{"uri":"Drahoslav_L%C3%ADm","surface_form":"Drahoslav L\u00EDm","offset":1279},{"uri":"Gel_electrophoresis","surface_form":"gel","offset":1333},{"uri":"Transparency","surface_form":"transparent","offset":1383},{"uri":"Polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate","surface_form":"Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)","offset":1421},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patented","offset":1461},{"uri":"Produce","surface_form":"produced","offset":1623},{"uri":"Faculty_of_Chemical_Technology","surface_form":"Institute of Chemical Technology","offset":1814},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"Communist","offset":1862},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":1899},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiments","offset":1966},{"uri":"Produce","surface_form":"produced","offset":2070},{"uri":"Contact_lens","surface_form":"contact lenses","offset":2103},{"uri":"Apparatus","surface_form":"apparatus","offset":2133},{"uri":"Merkur_(toy)","surface_form":"Merkur","offset":2179},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":2238},{"uri":"Prototype","surface_form":"prototype","offset":2398},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"motor","offset":2518},{"uri":"Gramophone_record","surface_form":"gramophone","offset":2539},{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"devices","offset":2562},{"uri":"International_organization","surface_form":"international organizations","offset":2738},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":2777},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":2824},{"uri":"The_Two_Thousand_Words","surface_form":"The Two Thousand Words","offset":3000},{"uri":"Velvet_Revolution","surface_form":"Velvet Revolution","offset":3065},{"uri":"Czechoslovak_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences","offset":3130},{"uri":"Czech_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic","offset":3201},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":3402},{"uri":"3899_Wichterle","surface_form":"3899","offset":3418},{"uri":"Ostrava","surface_form":"Ostrava","offset":3475}]}
