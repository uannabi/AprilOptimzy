{"id":566680,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chamberlain","text":"e=\"preserve\">Michael Leigh Chamberlain (27 February 1944 \u2013 9 January 2017) was a New Zealand-born Australian writer, teacher and pastor. He was best known due to the August 1980 death of his missing daughter Azaria as the result of a dingo attack while camping near Uluru in the Northern Territory, Australia.\nChamberlain's then-wife Lindy was falsely convicted of the baby's murder in 1982 and he was convicted of being an accessory after the fact. The findings of a 1987 royal commission made sure that the couple was innocent, but not before they were hated by the public and negatively covered by the media.\nChamberlain died on 9 January 2017 at Gosford Hospital, on the New South Wales central coast, aged 72 from complications of acute myeloid leukemia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":81},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":98},{"uri":"Death_of_Azaria_Chamberlain","surface_form":"death of his missing daughter Azaria","offset":178},{"uri":"Dingo","surface_form":"dingo","offset":234},{"uri":"Uluru","surface_form":"Uluru","offset":266},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":279},{"uri":"Lindy_Chamberlain-Creighton","surface_form":"Lindy","offset":334},{"uri":"Accessory_after_the_fact","surface_form":"accessory after the fact","offset":424},{"uri":"Royal_commission","surface_form":"royal commission","offset":473},{"uri":"Gosford_Hospital","surface_form":"Gosford Hospital","offset":650},{"uri":"Acute_myeloid_leukemia","surface_form":"acute myeloid leukemia","offset":736}]}
