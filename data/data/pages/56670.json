{"id":56670,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazrat_Babajan","text":"Hazrat Babajan (1806\u20131931), birthname Gool Rukh (\"like a rose\"), was born as a Pathan lady in a noble Muslim family of Balochistan in northern British India Empire (now Pakistan). At the age of 18 she fled her arranged marriage and sought God instead. She journeyed to the northeast, first to Peshawar and then to Rawalpindi, disguised by her Muslim veil. She lived for a year and a half in the mountainous regions of what is now Pakistan under the guidance of a Hindu sadguru, then traveled to Punjab. In Multan, at the age of 37, she received God-realization from an Islamic qutub (Muslim master), Maula Shah.\nBabajan is most famously remembered as the spiritual master of Meher Baba.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pathan","surface_form":"Pathan","offset":79},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":102},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":143},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"Empire","offset":157},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":169},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":239},{"uri":"Peshawar","surface_form":"Peshawar","offset":293},{"uri":"Rawalpindi","surface_form":"Rawalpindi","offset":314},{"uri":"Sadguru","surface_form":"sadguru","offset":469},{"uri":"Punjab_(India)","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":495},{"uri":"Meher_Baba","surface_form":"Meher Baba","offset":675}]}
