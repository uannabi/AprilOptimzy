She started Aswat (\u0623\u0635\u0648\u0627\u062A), the first Palestinian group for lesbian rights. In 2006, she received the Felipa de Souza Award from the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (Now called OutRight Action International).\nIn 2002, Morcos joined the first online group for Palestinian lesbians in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In 2003, she was outed after she gave an interview to an Israeli newspaper. Morcos asked that her sexual orientation not be published. But the newspaper wrote \u201Clesbian\u201D in the headline and printed her photograph. After Morcos's sexual orientation was made public, she was harassed and physically assaulted. Her car was vandalized many times. She lost her job. She volunteered her time at Aswat until the organization had enough money to hire her.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Palestinian_people","surface_form":"Palestinian","offset":74},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":86},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":94},{"uri":"Aswat","surface_form":"Aswat","offset":116},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"rights","offset":171},{"uri":"Felipa_de_Souza_Award","surface_form":"Felipa de Souza Award","offset":205},{"uri":"OutRight_Action_International","surface_form":"International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission","offset":236},{"uri":"OutRight_Action_International","surface_form":"OutRight Action International","offset":302},{"uri":"Palestinian_territories","surface_form":"Palestinian Authority","offset":423},{"uri":"Outing","surface_form":"outed","offset":463},{"uri":"Interview","surface_form":"interview","offset":487},{"uri":"Israeli","surface_form":"Israeli","offset":503},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":511},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":544},{"uri":"Published","surface_form":"published","offset":570},{"uri":"Headline","surface_form":"headline","offset":622},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":647},{"uri":"Harassment","surface_form":"harassed","offset":718},{"uri":"Assault","surface_form":"assault","offset":742},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":757},{"uri":"Vandalism","surface_form":"vandalized","offset":765},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":801},{"uri":"Volunteer","surface_form":"volunteer","offset":810},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":850},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":874}]}
