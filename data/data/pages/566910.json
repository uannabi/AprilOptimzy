{"id":566910,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_the_Gard_department","text":"e=\"preserve\">There are 3 arrondissements in the Gard department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into \"arrondissements\", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.\nIf the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.\nArrondissements are further divided into communes.\nHistory.\nGard is one of the 83 French departments made during the French revolution, on 4 March 1790. it was divided in 8 districts: Alais, Beaucaire, N\u00EEmes, Pont-Saint-Esprit, Saint-Hippolyte, Sommi\u00E8res, Uz\u00E8s and Le\u00A0Vigan. The capital was N\u00EEmes alternating with Alais and Uz\u00E8s. In 1794, N\u00EEmes became the only capital.\nWith the creation of the \"arrondissements\", the 8 districts became four \"arrondissements\": N\u00EEmes, Alais, Uz\u00E8s and Le\u00A0Vigan. In 1926, the \"arrondissement\" of Uz\u00E8s was eliminated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gard","surface_form":"Gard","offset":48},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":69},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":76},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"arrondissements","offset":131},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":218},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"subprefecture","offset":274},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":296},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"communes","offset":507},{"uri":"French_revolution","surface_form":"French revolution","offset":583},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":639},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":745}]}
