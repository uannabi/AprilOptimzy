In general, 5-6 bureaucrats are gathered in takobeya to make a new law. Mainly a takobeya is changed from a conference room in the buildings of central government ministries.\nOriginally, takobeya means an accommodation hut for harsh labors at construction sites in the Meiji period. The work of bureaucrats in takobeya for laws are so harsh that bureaucrats call their room \"Takobeya\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Room","surface_form":"room","offset":26},{"uri":"Bureaucrat","surface_form":"bureaucrat","offset":46},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":69},{"uri":"Conference","surface_form":"conference","offset":209},{"uri":"Ministry","surface_form":"ministries","offset":264},{"uri":"Takobeya","surface_form":"takobeya","offset":288},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":344},{"uri":"Meiji_period","surface_form":"Meiji period","offset":370}]}
