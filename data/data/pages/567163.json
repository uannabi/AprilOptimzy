The watershed across the plateau divides the drainage basin in two: the Atlantic to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.\nOn its southern slopes is the source of the H\u00E9rault river, that flows to the south into the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe mountain is formed by granite from the Palaeozoic era.\nOn top of the mountain there is a meteorological station built in 1887. It is the last remaining weather station in France which is still inhabited by meteorologists. An exhibition on weather forecasting is open to visitors in the summer months.\nClimate.\nMont Aigoual has an oceanic climate (Cfc), bordering to a subartic (Dfc) (highland) climate.\nSports.\nA well-known hiking route is the \"Climbing of the 4,000 steps\" that begins in Valleraugue and ends in the weather station.\nThe ski station (a place where people go to practice skiing) of Prat Peyrot is on the sides of the Aigoual. It is the biggest ski station of the C\u00E9vennes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":21},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":28},{"uri":"C%C3%A9vennes","surface_form":"C\u00E9vennes","offset":44},{"uri":"Massif_Central","surface_form":"Massif Central","offset":77},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":99},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":109},{"uri":"Loz%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Loz\u00E8re","offset":144},{"uri":"Gard","surface_form":"Gard","offset":155},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":160},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":258},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":281},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":304},{"uri":"Mont_Blanc","surface_form":"Mont Blanc","offset":313},{"uri":"Route","surface_form":"route","offset":439},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":683},{"uri":"Mont_Loz%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Mont Loz\u00E8re","offset":823},{"uri":"National_Park","surface_form":"National Park","offset":886},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summit","offset":909},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":938},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":954},{"uri":"Valleraugue","surface_form":"Valleraugue","offset":1022},{"uri":"Bassurels_(Loz%C3%A8re)","surface_form":"Bassurels (Loz\u00E8re)","offset":1044},{"uri":"Watershed","surface_form":"watershed","offset":1068},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":1109},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":1136},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":1166},{"uri":"Slope","surface_form":"slopes","offset":1210},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":1224},{"uri":"H%C3%A9rault_(river)","surface_form":"H\u00E9rault","offset":1238},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":1331},{"uri":"Palaeozoic","surface_form":"Palaeozoic","offset":1348},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":1359},{"uri":"Meteorology","surface_form":"meteorological","offset":1398},{"uri":"Weather_station","surface_form":"station","offset":1413},{"uri":"Weather_station","surface_form":"weather station","offset":1461},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1480},{"uri":"Meteorologist","surface_form":"meteorologist","offset":1515},{"uri":"Weather_forecasting","surface_form":"weather forecasting","offset":1548},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":1639},{"uri":"Subarctic_climate","surface_form":"subartic","offset":1677},{"uri":"Hiking","surface_form":"hiking","offset":1733},{"uri":"Stairs","surface_form":"steps","offset":1776},{"uri":"Ski_resort","surface_form":"ski station","offset":1847},{"uri":"Skiing","surface_form":"skiing","offset":1896}]}
