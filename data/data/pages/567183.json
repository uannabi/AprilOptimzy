{"id":567183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allg%C3%A4u_Alps","text":"The Allg\u00E4u Alps are a mountain range in the Northern Limestone Alps. They are located in Bavaria in Germany, and Tyrol and Vorarlberg in Austria. The range is directly east of Lake Constance.\nThere are relatively high levels of rain and it is the rainiest place in Germany. While there are some permanent snowfields, there are no glaciers. Most mountains have grassy faces on one side, and sheer cliffs on the other. Further south the mountains begin to look Dolomite, as they have crevices and gullies. The main river in the region is the Iller, which splits the mountains in half. The high peaks are all on the east of the Iller. On the west they are usually not taller than 2200m. Many activities occur in them, including hiking and skiing.\nThe ten highest peaks.\nThe highest peaks of the Allg\u00E4u Alps are either on Austrian soil or on the Austro-German border.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Northern_Limestone_Alps","surface_form":"Northern Limestone Alps","offset":44},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":89},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":100},{"uri":"Tyrol_(state)","surface_form":"Tyrol","offset":113},{"uri":"Vorarlberg","surface_form":"Vorarlberg","offset":123},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":137},{"uri":"Lake_Constance","surface_form":"Lake Constance","offset":176},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":228},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glaciers","offset":330},{"uri":"Dolomite","surface_form":"Dolomite","offset":459},{"uri":"Crevice","surface_form":"crevices","offset":482},{"uri":"Gullie","surface_form":"gullies","offset":495},{"uri":"Iller","surface_form":"Iller","offset":540},{"uri":"Hiking","surface_form":"hiking","offset":725},{"uri":"Skiing","surface_form":"skiing","offset":736}]}
