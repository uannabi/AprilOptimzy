The states were called barbary states or berbery states, after the people of the Berbers, who lived there. The coastal regions were commonly called barbary coast.\nDuring the era of Colonialism, names were introduced or re-used, to split this area into single states: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.\nToday, this region is commonly called Maghreb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":95},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":108},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":131},{"uri":"Sahara","surface_form":"Sahara","offset":152},{"uri":"Berber_people","surface_form":"Berbers","offset":241},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"Colonialism","offset":341},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":419},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":427},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":436},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":445},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":458},{"uri":"Maghreb","surface_form":"Maghreb","offset":503}]}
