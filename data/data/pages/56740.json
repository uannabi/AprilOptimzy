It means a temperature that is normal in rooms used by human beings.\nHuman comfort and health.\nA comfortable room temperature depends on individual needs and other factors. According to the West Midlands Public Health Observatory (UK), is the recommended living room temperature, and is a good bedroom temperature.\nHowever, in hotter countries such as those near the equator room temperature can be as high as.\nRoom Temperature is the temperature that is comfortable and normal to be in.\nScience.\nFor scientific work, room temperature is taken to be in the range with an average of. Scientists use kelvins (K) for temperature. The Rankine (\u00B0R) unit is no longer used.\nCondition for physical experiments.\nThe progress and results of many scientific and industrial processes can sometimes depend on the temperature of the surroundings of the equipment. For example, a measurement of the charge of the electron does not depend upon the temperature of the test equipment. In this case, if scientists mention temperature at all, they usually only mention \"room temperature\", which means that what is being measured has not been cooled or heated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":87},{"uri":"Public_health_observatory","surface_form":"West Midlands Public Health Observatory (UK)","offset":266},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"kelvins","offset":674},{"uri":"Rankine","surface_form":"Rankine","offset":707}]}
