{"id":56755,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a tuple is a finite sequence of objects. Sometimes, the finite sequence is also called an \"ordered list\". This means that the order of the objects matter. In a tuple, the objects are either enclosed within parentheses (such as formula_1), or within angle brackets (such as formula_1). Each of the objects in the list has a certain type. A tuple consisting of \"n\" entries is called an n-tuple. Tuples are used to describe mathematical objects that are made of certain, well-defined components. They are also used very frequently with databases.\nIn other words, tuples are like ordered multisets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Finite","surface_form":"finite","offset":42},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":49},{"uri":"Bracket","surface_form":"brackets","offset":284},{"uri":"Database","surface_form":"database","offset":562},{"uri":"Multiset","surface_form":"multiset","offset":613}]}
