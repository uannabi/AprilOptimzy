They are cultural nationalists, and moved from supporting secularism to having a pro-Islamic stance. They are Eurosceptics, meaning they are against the European Union.\nTheir slogan is: \"\u00DClkenin Gelece\u011Fine Oy Ver\" (meaning \"Vote for the country's future\").\nThe MHP refuses to have any form of dialogue with the left-wing Kurdish nationalist Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":75},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":124},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":143},{"uri":"Alparslan_T%C3%BCrke%C5%9F","surface_form":"Alparslan T\u00FCrke\u015F","offset":193},{"uri":"Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey","surface_form":"Grand National Assembly of Turkey","offset":345},{"uri":"Neo-fascism","surface_form":"neo-fascist","offset":510},{"uri":"Cultural_nationalism","surface_form":"cultural nationalists","offset":584},{"uri":"Secularism","surface_form":"secularism","offset":633},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":660},{"uri":"Euroscepticism","surface_form":"Eurosceptics","offset":685},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":728},{"uri":"Slogan","surface_form":"slogan","offset":750},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":886},{"uri":"Kurdish_people","surface_form":"Kurdish","offset":896}]}
