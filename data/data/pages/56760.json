{"id":56760,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram","text":"e=\"preserve\">A histogram is a concept from statistics. It is a graphical display that tells us about the distribution of the samples involved. They are commonly a picture made from a table with many categories. The table tells how many samples there are in each category.\nThe word \"histogram\" is derived from \"histos\" and \"gramma\" in Greek. \"Histos\" means \"web\" or \"mast\". \"Gramma\" means \"drawing\", \"record\" or \"writing\". A histogram of something is therefore, etymologically speaking, a drawing of the web of this something.\nSimilar ideas.\nThe histogram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control, which also include the Pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause-and-effect diagram, flowchart, and scatter diagram.\nA population pyramid is two histograms.\nA generalization of the histogram is kernel smoothing techniques. This will construct a smooth probability density function from the supplied data.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":43},{"uri":"Graph","surface_form":"graphical display","offset":63},{"uri":"Frequency_distribution","surface_form":"distribution","offset":105},{"uri":"Table_(information)","surface_form":"table","offset":183},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":334},{"uri":"Etymology","surface_form":"etymologically","offset":461},{"uri":"Pareto_chart","surface_form":"Pareto chart","offset":630},{"uri":"Check_sheet","surface_form":"check sheet","offset":644},{"uri":"Control_chart","surface_form":"control chart","offset":657},{"uri":"Cause-and-effect_diagram","surface_form":"cause-and-effect diagram","offset":672},{"uri":"Flowchart","surface_form":"flowchart","offset":698},{"uri":"Scatter_diagram","surface_form":"scatter diagram","offset":713},{"uri":"Population_pyramid","surface_form":"population pyramid","offset":732},{"uri":"Kernel_(statistics)","surface_form":"kernel","offset":807},{"uri":"Probability_density_function","surface_form":"probability density function","offset":865}]}
