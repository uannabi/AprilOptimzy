{"id":56761,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_manure","text":"Historically, the practice of green manuring can be traced back to the fallow cycle of crop rotation, which was used to allow soils to recover.\nGreen manures in organic farming.\nOrganic farming relies on soil health and cycling of nutrients through the soil using natural processes, such as the addition of animal manures. If animal manures are not available, in a stockless rotation, green manures perform a vital function of fertilization.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fallow","surface_form":"fallow","offset":71},{"uri":"Crop_rotation","surface_form":"crop rotation","offset":87},{"uri":"Organic_farming","surface_form":"Organic farming","offset":178},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":209},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":307}]}
