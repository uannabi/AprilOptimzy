{"id":56762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution","text":"The normal distribution is a probability distribution. It is also called Gaussian distribution because it was first discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is very important in many fields of science.\nNormal distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form. These distributions differ in their \"location\" and \"scale\" parameters: the mean (\"average\") of the distribution defines its location, and the standard deviation (\"variability\") defines the scale. These two parameters are represented by the symbols formula_1 and formula_1, respectively.\nThe standard normal distribution (also known as the Z distribution) is the normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (the green curves in the plots to the right). It is often called the bell curve, because the graph of its probability density looks like a bell.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Probability_distribution","surface_form":"probability distribution","offset":29},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gauss","offset":130},{"uri":"Continuous","surface_form":"continuous","offset":181},{"uri":"Parameter","surface_form":"parameter","offset":403},{"uri":"Mean","surface_form":"mean","offset":419},{"uri":"Standard_deviation","surface_form":"standard deviation","offset":486},{"uri":"Mean","surface_form":"mean","offset":733},{"uri":"Probability_density_function","surface_form":"probability density","offset":884},{"uri":"Bell","surface_form":"bell","offset":917}]}
