{"id":567672,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson_M%26P","text":"Smith & Wesson M&P (Military and Police) is a series of handguns named after the famous 20th century Smith & Wesson service revolvers. They are designed mainly for military, police and personal defense use. They are offered in calibers including: .22 LR, .380 ACP, 9\u00D719mm Parabellum, .357 Magnum and .45 ACP.\nHistory.\nIn 1852, gunsmiths Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson formed the partnership Smith & Wesson. After having financial troubles, in 1854 they sold the company to a shirt manufacturer named Oliver Winchester. In 1866, Winchester renamed the company Winchester Repeating Arms Company. That same year Smith and Wesson formed the second company called Smith & Wesson, which is still in operation.\nIn 1899, the company produced their now-famous Military & Police pistol. It was a double-action which set a standard for modern revolvers. It also introduced what has become a very popular caliber, the .38 S&W Special.\nIn 2005, the company introduced Smith & Wesson M&P model pistol. It was the first polymer handgun for S&W. It is available in 9mm and.40 S&W, and as of February 2016, in.45 ACP. It is recoil-operated and uses the Browning-type locking system.\nIn 2008 the name M&P expanded to became a series of handguns. It includes polymer pistols, (alloy) revolvers and AR-type rifles. The color, with a few exceptions, is usually black.\nThe M&P line has expanded to include the \"Pro-series\", \"Shield-series\" and \"Bodyguard-series\" guns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":46},{"uri":"Handgun","surface_form":"handgun","offset":56},{"uri":"Famous","surface_form":"famous","offset":81},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":88},{"uri":"Smith_%26amp%3B_Wesson","surface_form":"Smith & Wesson","offset":101},{"uri":"Revolver","surface_form":"revolver","offset":124},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":164},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":174},{"uri":"Personal_defense_weapon","surface_form":"personal defense","offset":185},{"uri":"Caliber","surface_form":"caliber","offset":227},{"uri":".22_Long_Rifle","surface_form":".22 LR","offset":247},{"uri":".380_ACP","surface_form":".380 ACP","offset":255},{"uri":"9%C3%9719mm_Parabellum","surface_form":"9\u00D719mm Parabellum","offset":265},{"uri":".357_Magnum","surface_form":".357 Magnum","offset":284},{"uri":".45_ACP","surface_form":".45 ACP","offset":300},{"uri":"Horace_Smith_(inventor)","surface_form":"Horace Smith","offset":337},{"uri":"Daniel_B._Wesson","surface_form":"Daniel B.
