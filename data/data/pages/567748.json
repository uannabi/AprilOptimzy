{"id":567748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Sl%C3%A1nsk%C3%BD","text":"Rudolf Salzmann Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD (1901\u20131952) was a Czechoslovak Communist politician. He was a longtime member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Later he was the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee (1945-1951). Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD was one of the main organizers of the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00E9tat. During World War II he was a member of Czechoslovak exile resistance in the foreign centre in Moscow. Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD was executed on December 3, 1952 at Prague\u2019s Pankrac Prison.\nEarly years.\nSl\u00E1nsk\u00FD was born on July 31, 1901 in Nezv\u011Bstice near Pilsen, Bohemia. His father was a Jewish merchant. He studied at a public academy in Plze\u0148. Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD joined the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1921, three years after it was formed. In 1924 he was the editor of the Communist Party newspaper, \"Rude Pravo\". He rose in the ranks of the Party becoming a member of the Central Committee. He was in hiding from 1929 to 1935 because the Party was illegal in Czechoslovakia at the time. He became a member of the National Assembly and a close associate of Klement Gottwald.\nWorld War II.\nWhen the Munich Agreement was signed in 1938, Czechoslovakia\u2019s Sudetenland was taken over by Nazi Germany. When the German army marched into the Sudetenland on October 1, 1938, Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD fled. He went to the Soviet Union and stayed there during most of World War II. He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1944 and took part in the Slovak National Uprising.\nPostwar.\nAfter the war, he was involved in politics. The Communist Party in Czechoslovakia agreed to accept many of Joseph Stalin's trained Czechs. Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD was made the Secretary-General of the Party in Czechoslovakia. By 1948, it was clear that Gottwald was following the Stalinist style of politics.\nArrest and trial.\nSl\u00E1nsk\u00FD himself had been in charge of purges of several of his associates. When Gottwald thought he might be next, he had Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD and 13 others arrested. The charges against Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD included treason, spying and sabotage. Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD finally confessed after being tortured. Then he had to memorize a speech for the show trial. All of the 14 had confessed. Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD was one of the 11 who was given a death sentence. Twice Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD attempted suicide while he was waiting for his execution. Finally, on December 3, 1952, he was hanged at Pankrac Prison.\nAfter Stalin died in 1953, there were fewer purges. In April 1963, Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD and his fellow victims were cleared of the charges against them. In May, 1968, Sl\u00E1nsk\u00FD and the others were formally exonerated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovak","offset":42},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"Communist","offset":55},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":65},{"uri":"Member","surface_form":"member","offset":95},{"uri":"Central_Committee","surface_form":"Central Committee","offset":109},{"uri":"General_Secretary","surface_form":"General Secretary","offset":168},{"uri":"Organize","surface_form":"organize","offset":256},{"uri":"1948_Czechoslovak_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":274},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":312},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":399},{"uri":"Executed","surface_form":"executed","offset":419},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":451},{"uri":"Plze%C5%88","surface_form":"Pilsen","offset":542},{"uri":"Bohemia","surface_form":"Bohemia","offset":550},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":576},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchant","offset":583},{"uri":"Studied","surface_form":"studied","offset":596},{"uri":"Academy","surface_form":"academy","offset":616},{"uri":"Plze%C5%88","surface_form":"Plze\u0148","offset":627},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":933},{"uri":"Associate","surface_form":"associate","offset":1028},{"uri":"Klement_Gottwald","surface_form":"Klement Gottwald","offset":1041},{"uri":"Munich_Agreement","surface_form":"Munich Agreement","offset":1082},{"uri":"Sudetenland","surface_form":"Sudetenland","offset":1136},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":1166},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1279},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1324},{"uri":"Slovak_National_Uprising","surface_form":"Slovak National Uprising","offset":1397},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":1539},{"uri":"Purge","surface_form":"purge","offset":1781},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrest","offset":1887},{"uri":"Indictment","surface_form":"charges","offset":1901},{"uri":"Treason","surface_form":"treason","offset":1934},{"uri":"Spy","surface_form":"spy","offset":1943},{"uri":"Sabotage","surface_form":"sabotage","offset":1954},{"uri":"Confess","surface_form":"confess","offset":1980},{"uri":"Torture","surface_form":"torture","offset":2002},{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"memorize","offset":2027},{"uri":"Speech","surface_form":"speech","offset":2038},{"uri":"Show_trial","surface_form":"show trial","offset":2053},{"uri":"Death_sentence","surface_form":"death sentence","offset":2136},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":2176},{"uri":"Victim","surface_form":"victim","offset":2377},{"uri":"Exoneration","surface_form":"exonerated","offset":2478}]}
