{"id":56776,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome","text":"Salome or Salom\u00E9 (Hebrew: \u05E9\u05DC\u05D5\u05DE\u05D9\u05EA Shlomit) (c AD 14 between 62 and 71), is the name of a character in the New Testament. Her name is not actually given there, but she was an entirely historical person. She was the daughter of Herod Antipas and Herodias. Her name is pronounced with a short 'o', and the 'e' at the end is sounded.\nThis Salome is not the same Salome who is said to be a witness to the Crucifixion of Jesus in Mark 15:40.\nBiblical character.\nAccording to Mark 6:21-29, Salome was the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, and danced before Herod and her mother Herodias at the occasion of Herod's birthday. The New Testament suggests that Salome caused John the Baptist to be executed because his spoke out that Herod's marriage to Herodias was adulterous. Herodias put her up to the demand that John be executed, something the king was initially reluctant to do.\nHer name.\nHer name is established by being mentioned in the account by Flavius Josephus in Josephus's \"Jewish Antiquities\" (Book XVIII, Chapter 5, 4). Despite the early date of this account, she was not always called Salome until the nineteenth century, when Gustave Flaubert (following Josephus) referred to her as Salome in his play \"Herodias\" (1876).\nThere is a coin with her name on it. This rare coin bears the inscription BACI\u039BIC \u03A3\u0386\u039B\u03A9\u039C\u0389 (Queen Salome). It is the reverse side of her later husband's coinage of Chalcis and Armenia Minor He was Aristobulus of Chalcis.\nAdaptations.\nThe story above has been adapted to various forms of art. Innumerable paintings about it exist. There is a play by Oscar Wilde. Operas about it have been composed by Richard Strauss and Jules Massenet. Ballets by Florent Schmit and Flemming Flindt. Various films have also been made between 1918 and 2006. The antagonist character in the bluegrass musical The Robber Bridegroom is named Salome.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":45},{"uri":"14","surface_form":"14","offset":48},{"uri":"62","surface_form":"62","offset":59},{"uri":"71","surface_form":"71","offset":66},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":105},{"uri":"Herod_Antipas","surface_form":"Herod Antipas","offset":225},{"uri":"Herodias","surface_form":"Herodias","offset":243},{"uri":"Crucifixion","surface_form":"Crucifixion","offset":399},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":414},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Mark","surface_form":"Mark","offset":468},{"uri":"Herodias","surface_form":"Herodias","offset":567},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":617},{"uri":"John_the_Baptist","surface_form":"John the Baptist","offset":659},{"uri":"Adultery","surface_form":"adulterous","offset":751},{"uri":"Gustave_Flaubert","surface_form":"Gustave Flaubert","offset":1129},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":1563},{"uri":"Oscar_Wilde","surface_form":"Oscar Wilde","offset":1571},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"Opera","offset":1584},{"uri":"Richard_Strauss","surface_form":"Richard Strauss","offset":1622},{"uri":"Jules_Massenet","surface_form":"Jules Massenet","offset":1642},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"Ballet","offset":1658},{"uri":"Florent_Schmit","surface_form":"Florent Schmit","offset":1669},{"uri":"Flemming_Flindt","surface_form":"Flemming Flindt","offset":1688},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":1747},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1756},{"uri":"The_Robber_Bridegroom_(musical)","surface_form":"The Robber Bridegroom","offset":1812}]}
