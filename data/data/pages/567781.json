It arcs from the north to the east.\nIn the west another branch goes south, which is where the Gro\u00DFer Krottenkopf (2,656 m) is found. The mountain is the highest in the whole Allg\u00E4u Alps.\nOn the main ridge of the Hornbach chain, the highest peaks are the Marchspitze (2,609 m), the Bretterspitze (2,608 m) and the Urbeleskarspitze (2,632 m).
