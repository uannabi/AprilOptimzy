He studied at the University of Kansas.\nCareer.\nTrooper moved to New York City for the 1980s and part of the 1990s, where he formed The Greg Trooper Band along with Larry Campbell on guitar, Greg Shirley on bass and Walter Thompson on drums. During this time he recorded his first two records: \"We Won't Dance\" and the critically acclaimed \"Everywhere\" produced by Stewart Lerman.\nHe also met songwriter/publisher Earl Shuman, who secured Trooper's first publishing deal with CBS Songs.

Tallent produced Trooper's 1996 album \"Noises in the Hallway\" and released it on his D'Ville Record Group label.\n\"Popular Demons\" followed in 1998, on Koch Records and produced by Buddy Miller. After the release of that album, Trooper signed with Nashville indie Eminent Records, which released \"Straight Down Rain\" in 2001.\nDeath.\nTropper died on January 15, 2017 in Nashville, Tennessee from pancreatic cancer, aged 61.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Steve_Earle","surface_form":"Steve Earle","offset":142},{"uri":"Billy_Bragg","surface_form":"Billy Bragg","offset":155},{"uri":"Vince_Gill","surface_form":"Vince Gill","offset":171},{"uri":"Neptune_Township%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Neptune Township, New Jersey","offset":215},{"uri":"Little_Silver%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Little Silver","offset":266},{"uri":"University_of_Kansas","surface_form":"University of Kansas","offset":299},{"uri":"Larry_Campbell_(musician)","surface_form":"Larry Campbell","offset":446},{"uri":"Stewart_Lerman","surface_form":"Stewart Lerman","offset":646},{"uri":"Earl_Shuman","surface_form":"Earl Shuman","offset":695},{"uri":"CBS_Songs","surface_form":"CBS Songs","offset":757},{"uri":"Steve_Earle","surface_form":"Steve Earle","offset":810},{"uri":"E_Street_Band","surface_form":"E Street Band","offset":895},{"uri":"Garry_Tallent","surface_form":"Garry Tallent","offset":917},{"uri":"D%27Ville_Record_Group","surface_form":"D'Ville Record Group","offset":1060},{"uri":"Koch_Records","surface_form":"Koch Records","offset":1126},{"uri":"Buddy_Miller","surface_form":"Buddy Miller","offset":1155},{"uri":"Eminent_Records","surface_form":"Eminent Records","offset":1238},{"uri":"Pancreatic_cancer","surface_form":"pancreatic cancer","offset":1369}]}
