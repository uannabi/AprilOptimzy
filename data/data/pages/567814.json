{"id":567814,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steiner","text":"Claude M. Steiner (6 January 1935 \u2013 9 January 2016) was a French-born American psychotherapist and writer. He wrote about transactional analysis (TA). His writings have focused especially on life scripts, alcoholism, emotional literacy, and interpersonal power plays.\nIn the 1970s and '80s, Steiner was a founder and practitioner of Radical Psychiatry, a new approach to psychotherapy based in a social theory (of alienation) rather than a medical one (of individual pathology). Influenced by progressive movements of the time, work in this modality continues into the present and is gaining recent recognition worldwide.\nSteiner died at his ranch in Ukiah, California on 9 January 2017, aged 81.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychotherapist","surface_form":"psychotherapist","offset":79},{"uri":"Transactional_analysis","surface_form":"transactional analysis","offset":122},{"uri":"Script_Analysis","surface_form":"life scripts","offset":191},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholism","offset":205},{"uri":"Emotional_literacy","surface_form":"emotional literacy","offset":217},{"uri":"Social_theory","surface_form":"social theory","offset":396},{"uri":"Ukiah%2C_California","surface_form":"Ukiah","offset":651},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":658}]}
