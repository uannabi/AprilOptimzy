Its systematic name is \u03B1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-\u03B2-D-fructofuranose. It is best known for its role in human nutrition and is formed by plants but not by higher organisms.\nPhysical and chemical properties.\nPure sucrose is most often prepared as a fine, white, odorless crystalline powder with a pleasing, sweet taste.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disaccharide","surface_form":"disaccharide","offset":64},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":78},{"uri":"Fructose","surface_form":"fructose","offset":88},{"uri":"Molecular_formula","surface_form":"molecular formula","offset":107},{"uri":"Human_nutrition","surface_form":"human nutrition","offset":237},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":270},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":295},{"uri":"Powder","surface_form":"powder","offset":415}]}
