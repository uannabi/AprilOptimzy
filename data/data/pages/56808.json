{"id":56808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide","text":"A disaccharide is a sugar (a carbohydrate) composed of two monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose that make up the disaccharide sucrose. It is formed when two sugars are joined together and a molecule of water is removed. Due to this, disaccharides cannot hydrolyse, meaning their molecules are unable to be broken down through a reaction with water. For example, milk sugar (lactose) is made from glucose and galactose whereas cane sugar (sucrose) is made from glucose and fructose.\nCommon disaccharides.\nMaltose and cellobiose are hydrolysis products of the polysaccharides, starch and cellulose, respectively.\nSome common Disaccharides are: Maltose, Lactose and Sucrose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":20},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":29},{"uri":"Monosaccharide","surface_form":"monosaccharide","offset":59},{"uri":"Lactose","surface_form":"lactose","offset":383},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":405},{"uri":"Galactose","surface_form":"galactose","offset":417},{"uri":"Sucrose","surface_form":"sucrose","offset":447},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":469},{"uri":"Fructose","surface_form":"fructose","offset":481},{"uri":"Hydrolysis","surface_form":"hydrolysis","offset":540},{"uri":"Polysaccharide","surface_form":"polysaccharide","offset":567},{"uri":"Starch","surface_form":"starch","offset":584},{"uri":"Cellulose","surface_form":"cellulose","offset":595},{"uri":"Maltose","surface_form":"Maltose","offset":651},{"uri":"Lactose","surface_form":"Lactose","offset":660},{"uri":"Sucrose","surface_form":"Sucrose","offset":672}]}
