{"id":56827,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosaccharide","text":"Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates. They consist of one sugar and are usually colorless, water-soluble, crystalline solids. Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste.\nExamples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose, galactose, and ribose. Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides like sucrose (common sugar) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). Further, each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group (except for the first and last) is chiral, giving rise to a number of isomeric forms all with the same chemical formula. For instance, galactose and glucose are both aldohexoses, but they have different chemical and physical properties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":41},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":76},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":109},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystal","offset":124},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":136},{"uri":"Sweet_(taste)","surface_form":"sweet","offset":172},{"uri":"Taste","surface_form":"taste","offset":178},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":221},{"uri":"Fructose","surface_form":"fructose","offset":241},{"uri":"Galactose","surface_form":"galactose","offset":251},{"uri":"Ribose","surface_form":"ribose","offset":266},{"uri":"Disaccharide","surface_form":"disaccharide","offset":317},{"uri":"Sucrose","surface_form":"sucrose","offset":336},{"uri":"Polysaccharide","surface_form":"polysaccharide","offset":363},{"uri":"Cellulose","surface_form":"cellulose","offset":388},{"uri":"Starch","surface_form":"starch","offset":402},{"uri":"Hydroxyl","surface_form":"hydroxyl","offset":453},{"uri":"Chirality_(chemistry)","surface_form":"chiral","offset":503},{"uri":"Isomer","surface_form":"isomer","offset":538},{"uri":"Galactose","surface_form":"galactose","offset":603},{"uri":"Aldohexose","surface_form":"aldohexose","offset":634}]}
