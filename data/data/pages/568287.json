{"id":568287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takobeya_labour","text":"e=\"preserve\">Takobeya labour (, Romanization of Japanese: tako-beya r\u014Dd\u014D) was a Japanese form of work. It was a harsh system started in Hokkaido during the Meiji period. It replaced Penal labour in Hokkaido. The workers slept in accommodation huts at construction sites. The concentration huts were called \"Takobeya\". Takobeya workers engaged in takobeya labour without enough meals. They were oppressed as labor camps. Some also died from overwork.\nIn 1946, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in occupied Japan banned takobeya labour.\nIn Japanese, \"Tako\" often means octopus. But Takobeya (Tako room) doesn\u2019t necessarily mean octopus room. About Takobeya's \"Tako\", the original meanings is not clear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romanization_of_Japanese","surface_form":"Romanization of Japanese","offset":32},{"uri":"Hokkaido","surface_form":"Hokkaido","offset":136},{"uri":"Meiji_period","surface_form":"Meiji period","offset":156},{"uri":"Penal_labour","surface_form":"Penal labour","offset":182},{"uri":"Construction","surface_form":"construction","offset":251},{"uri":"Meal","surface_form":"meal","offset":377},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allied Powers","offset":489},{"uri":"Octopus","surface_form":"octopus","offset":577},{"uri":"Room","surface_form":"room","offset":605}]}
