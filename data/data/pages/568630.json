{"id":568630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakinosaurus","text":"\"Wakinosaurus\" (meaning \"Wakino lizard\") is a dubious genus of theropod dinosaur. It is named from the find of \"a single tooth\".\u202D \u202CThe genus is dubious (doubtful) because it is almost impossible to assign further fossil material to it.\nThe find was made in Lower Cretaceous deposits in Fukuoka, Japan in 1990 by Masahiro Sato. The triangular-shaped tooth has fine serrations on its cutting edge, which is standard for a theropod dinosaur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nomen_dubium","surface_form":"dubious","offset":46},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":54},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":63},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":72},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":257},{"uri":"Fukuoka","surface_form":"Fukuoka","offset":286},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":295},{"uri":"Masahiro_Sato","surface_form":"Masahiro Sato","offset":312},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangular-shaped","offset":331},{"uri":"Serration","surface_form":"serration","offset":364}]}
