The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into \"arrondissements\", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.\nIf the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.\nArrondissements are further divided into communes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cantal","surface_form":"Cantal","offset":48},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":71},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"departments","offset":78},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"arrondissements","offset":133},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":220},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"subprefecture","offset":276},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":298},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"communes","offset":509}]}
