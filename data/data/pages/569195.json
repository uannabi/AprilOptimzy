{"id":569195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53","text":"\"p53\" (or \"tp53\") is a gene vital to many forms of life, including humans. It codes for a protein which suppresses cancer. It has been called \"the guardian of the genome\".\nThe \"p53\" gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer. Its protein product binds to DNA and regulates gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome.\n\"p53\" protein (TP53) is at low levels in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This allows the most important cell division to proceed rapidly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gene","surface_form":"gene","offset":23},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":90},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":115},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":163},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":239},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":276},{"uri":"Gene_expression","surface_form":"gene expression","offset":294},{"uri":"Embryonic_stem_cell","surface_form":"embryonic stem cell","offset":393},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":454}]}
