Oberstdorf is farther south but is not a town. In 2005, Sonthofen was awarded \"Alpenstadt des Jahres\" (Alpine city of the year).\nIn World War II Sonthofen was bombed twice. This was because Adolf Hitler had built the \"Ordensburg Sonthofen\" in Sonthofen. Young boys were trained there for Nazi Party organisations. Sonthofen was given town rights on 18 August 1963.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":40},{"uri":"Oberallg%C3%A4u","surface_form":"Oberallg\u00E4u","offset":62},{"uri":"Bavarian_Alps","surface_form":"Bavarian Alps","offset":87},{"uri":"Oberstdorf","surface_form":"Oberstdorf","offset":102},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":234},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":292},{"uri":"Ordensburg_Sonthofen","surface_form":"Ordensburg Sonthofen","offset":320}]}
