{"id":5696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Alba","text":"Jessica Marie Alba (born April 28, 1981) is a businesswoman, American television and movie actress, and model. She started her business, The Honest Company, in 2011. Alba made her first movie, \"Camp Nowhere\", at age 13 and in the television drama series \"Dark Angel\" (2000\u20132002). Alba later acted in several movies, such as \"Honey\" (2003), \"Sin City\" (2005) and \"Good Luck Chuck\" (2007). Alba has won several awards for her acting. These awards include the \"Choice Actress\" award at the Teen Choice Award and a Saturn Award. Both of these awards were for her acting in the series \"Dark Angel\".\nShe has been listed in the \"Hot 100\" section of \"Maxim\" magazine every year from 2003 to 2007, and she was voted \"Sexiest Woman in the World\" by \"FHM\" in 2007. In March 2007, a picture of her was used on the cover of \"Playboy\". \"Playboy\" did not ask her if they could use the picture or tell her they were going to use it. This caused a lawsuit that was later dropped.\nEarly life.\nAlba was born in Pomona, California. Her mother, Catherine, is of Danish, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, English, German and French Canadian ancestry and her father, Mark, is Mexican American, and is of Indigenous Mexican, Sephardic Jewish, Spanish and Mayan ancestry. She has a younger brother named Joshua. Alba's father was in the Air Force and his career caused them to live in many different places. They lived in Biloxi, Mississippi and Del Rio, Texas before returning to California at age 9. When she was young, Alba was ill many times. She had a collapsed lung twice, had pneumonia four or five times each year and had problems with her appendix and tonsils. She was in hospitals for much of her childhood. This meant Alba did not spend much time with other children. Alba has also said that she had obsessive-compulsive disorder when she was a child. The disorder affected her much less when her family moved to California. She graduated from high school when she was 16 years old. After high school, she went to the Atlantic Theater Company.\nCareer.\nAlba wanted to act since she was five. She took her first acting class at age twelve. An acting agent signed her nine months later. Her first movie work was a small role in the 1994 movie \"Camp Nowhere\". At first, she was only hired for two weeks but ended up working for two months because another actress dropped out.\nAlba starred in two national television commercials when she was a child. One of these was for Nintendo and the other was for J.C. Penney. She played Jessica in three episodes of the Nickelodeon comedy series \"The Secret World of Alex Mack\". Alba was then Maya in the television series \"Flipper\". Her mother was a lifeguard and had taught Jessica to swim before she could walk. She is a certified scuba diver.\nIn 1998, she acted in \"Brooklyn South\", in two episodes of \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" and in an episode of \"The Love Boat: The Next Wave\". After Alba graduated from high school, she studied acting with William H. Macy and his wife, Felicity Huffman, at the Atlantic Theater Company.\nShe became more famous in Hollywood in 1999 after acting in the Drew Barrymore romantic comedy \"Never Been Kissed\", and as the main female character in the 1999 comedy-horror movie \"Idle Hands\". She was chosen from a group of 1,200 actresses for the role of the genetically-engineered soldier, on the FOX sci-fi television series \"Dark Angel\". The series ran for two seasons from 2000 until 2002. Alba was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work on that series. When she trained to be in \"Dark Angel\", Alba had to exercise very much and she starved herself. She said \"A lot of girls have eating disorders and I did too. I got obsessed with it.\" She also had obsessive compulsive disorder and panic attacks. She said she has been cooking for herself since the age of twelve so she would not become as fat as her family members.\nSome of Alba's most famous movie roles are a dancer in \"Sin City\" and as Marvel Comics character Sue Storm, the Invisible Woman in the \"Fantastic Four\". She also acted in \"Into the Blue\" in 2005 and \"Good Luck Chuck\" a few years later. In 2008, Alba played her first horror-movie role in \"The Eye\", a remake of the Hong Kong original. In February, she hosted an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences's ceremony. Later in the year, she starred in \"The Love Guru\".\nIn 2010, Alba appeared in five movies including \"Little Fockers\" and \"The Killer Inside Me\". The following year she appeared in \"Spy Kids 4\", a sequel to \"Spy Kids\".\nPublic image.\nIn 2007, \"Maxim Magazine\" listed Alba as number 2 in their \"Top 100\", after Lindsay Lohan. \"GQ\" had her picture on their June covers. In May, after eight million votes, \"FHM\" (UK and US editions) named Alba the winner as \"2007\u2019s Sexiest Woman in the World\". She received the Teen Choice Award for \"Choice Actress\" and Saturn Award for Best Actress (TV) for her role in \"Dark Angel\", along with a Golden Globe nomination. In 2006, she received an MTV Movie Award for \"Sexiest Performance\" for \"Sin City\".\nSome people have said Alba's acting was bad. She was nominated for a 2007 Razzie Award for Worst Actress for her work in \"Awake\", \"Good Luck Chuck\", and '.\nOn the cover of the March 2006 issue, \"Playboy\" magazine named Alba among its 25 Sexiest Celebrities and the \"Sex Star of the Year\". She took \"Playboy\" to court for using a picture of her without her permission. However, she later dropped the lawsuit when she got a personal apology from \"Playboy\" owner Hugh Hefner. He agreed to make donations to two charities that Alba supports.\nPersonal life.\nAlba was raised in the Roman Catholic religion. When she was a teenager she became a born-again Christian. However, she left the church after four years because she believed that she was being judged by the way she looked. She has said that she still believes in God even though she is not a member of the church. Alba has not performed naked. She was given the option to appear nude in \"Sin City\" by the movie's directors, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. She said no to the offer saying, \"I don't do nudity. I just don't. Maybe that makes me a bad actress. Maybe I won't get hired in some things. But I have too much anxiety\".\nWhile filming \"Dark Angel\", Alba began a romance with another member of the cast, Michael Weatherly. This caused controversy because he was 12 years older than she was. He asked her to marry him on her twentieth birthday but she said no. They eventually broke up after a four-year relationship. When talking about children, she said, \"I'm really girly when it comes to kids. I've been surrounded by children my whole life because I'm the oldest of 15 cousins - I've been changing (nappies) since I was six... I want to have a couple, for sure.\". Alba is a Democrat and attended the 2012 Democratic National Convention in support of President Obama's re-election.\nAlba married Cash Warren on May 19, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. She met him while making \"Fantastic Four\" in 2004. On June 7, 2008, Alba gave birth to a baby girl called Honor Marie Warren. She also does some charity work, including clothes charity \"Clothes Off Our Back\" and women's charity \"Step Up Women's Network\". On August 13, 2011, she gave birth to her second daughter, Haven Garner Warren. The couple divorced in 2015.\nIn November 2015, Alba began dating Adam Akers, a heir to the Akers Banking Corporation. Akers was born in March of 1997, making him 14 years Albas junior. He proposed in September of 2016 and the couple married in May of 2017.\nAlba announced her third pregnancy in October of 2017. A daughter, Dylan JoAnn Akers, was born in February of 2018. A fourth daughter, London Marissa Akers, was born in September 2019. Akers and Alba are currently expecting their third daughter together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["actor"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":61},{"uri":"Actress","surface_form":"actress","offset":91},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":186},{"uri":"Camp_Nowhere","surface_form":"Camp Nowhere","offset":194},{"uri":"Dark_Angel_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Dark Angel","offset":255},{"uri":"Honey_(movie)_(2003)","surface_form":"Honey","offset":325},{"uri":"Sin_City_(movie)","surface_form":"Sin City","offset":341},{"uri":"Good_Luck_Chuck","surface_form":"Good Luck Chuck","offset":363},{"uri":"Teen_Choice_Awards","surface_form":"Teen Choice Award","offset":487},{"uri":"Saturn_Award","surface_form":"Saturn Award","offset":511},{"uri":"Maxim_(magazine)","surface_form":"Maxim","offset":643},{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":650},{"uri":"Sexy","surface_form":"Sexiest","offset":708},{"uri":"FHM","surface_form":"FHM","offset":740},{"uri":"Playboy","surface_form":"Playboy","offset":812},{"uri":"Lawsuit","surface_form":"lawsuit","offset":931},{"uri":"Pomona%2C_California","surface_form":"Pomona, California","offset":992},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":1041},{"uri":"French_Canadian","surface_form":"French Canadian","offset":1093},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestry","offset":1109},{"uri":"Mexican_American","surface_form":"Mexican American","offset":1143},{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"Air Force","offset":1302},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":1320},{"uri":"Biloxi%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Biloxi, Mississippi","offset":1387},{"uri":"Del_Rio%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Del Rio, Texas","offset":1411},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1446},{"uri":"Ill","surface_form":"ill","offset":1496},{"uri":"Pneumothorax","surface_form":"collapsed lung","offset":1522},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":1548},{"uri":"Vermiform_appendix","surface_form":"appendix","offset":1613},{"uri":"Tonsil","surface_form":"tonsil","offset":1626},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":1646},{"uri":"Obsessive-compulsive_disorder","surface_form":"obsessive-compulsive disorder","offset":1776},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduated","offset":1905},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":1920},{"uri":"Atlantic_Theater_Company","surface_form":"Atlantic Theater Company","offset":1994},{"uri":"Acting","surface_form":"acting","offset":2086},{"uri":"Talent_agent","surface_form":"acting agent","offset":2117},{"uri":"Television_commercial","surface_form":"television commercial","offset":2377},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":2443},{"uri":"J.C._Penney","surface_form":"J.C.
