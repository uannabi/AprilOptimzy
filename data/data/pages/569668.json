{"id":569668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachet_d%27%C3%A9pices","text":"=\"preserve\">A sachet d'\u00E9pices is a small cheesecloth sack containing herbs and spices. It is used to add flavor to stocks, soups and sauces. It means \"small bag of spices\" in French.\nIt is often simply called a \"sachet\". It is used like a \"bouquet garni\", but a sachet's ingredients are inside a cheesecloth while a \"bouquet garni\" is not. This means that spices such as whole peppercorns and dried herbs, which cannot be used in a \"bouquet garni\", can go in a sachet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cheesecloth","surface_form":"cheesecloth","offset":41},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herbs","offset":69},{"uri":"Spice","surface_form":"spices","offset":79},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"stock","offset":115},{"uri":"Soups","surface_form":"soups","offset":123},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":133},{"uri":"Bouquet_garni","surface_form":"bouquet garni","offset":240},{"uri":"Peppercorn","surface_form":"peppercorn","offset":377}]}
