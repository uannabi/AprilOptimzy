{"id":56988,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muroidea","text":"Muroidea is a large superfamily of rodents. It includes hamsters, gerbils, true mice and rats, and many other relatives. They live on almost every continent except Antarctica. Some scientists have placed all members of this group into a single family, Muridae. Sometimes there are difficulties in knowing how the subfamilies are related to one another.\nThe muroids are classified in 6 families, 19 subfamilies, around 280 genera and at least 1300 species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Superfamily","surface_form":"superfamily","offset":20},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":35},{"uri":"Hamster","surface_form":"hamster","offset":56},{"uri":"Gerbil","surface_form":"gerbil","offset":66},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":80},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":89},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":147},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":164},{"uri":"Muridae","surface_form":"Muridae","offset":252},{"uri":"Subfamily","surface_form":"subfamilies","offset":313},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":385},{"uri":"Subfamily","surface_form":"subfamilies","offset":398},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":422},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":447}]}
