{"id":569969,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filostrato_(poem)","text":"Filostrato is a poem by 14th-century Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio. It tells about Troilo's love for Criseyda. The historical importance comes from two reasons. One reason is that it is one of the first long poems written in ottava rima. The second is that it was a source for Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Troilus and Criseyde\". Ottava rima is a strophe built of eight lines and rhymed abababcc.\nBoccaccio's poem was based on \"Roman de Troie\" by Ben\u00F4it de Sainte Maure, \"Historia troiana\" by Guido delle Colonne, a similar story by Binduccio dello Scelto and \"Historia Troiae\" by Filippo Ceppi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Giovanni_Boccaccio","surface_form":"Giovanni Boccaccio","offset":50},{"uri":"Ottava_rima","surface_form":"ottava rima","offset":227},{"uri":"Geoffrey_Chaucer","surface_form":"Geoffrey Chaucer","offset":279}]}
