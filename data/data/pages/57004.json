{"id":57004,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD","text":"e=\"preserve\">The NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) was a government department in the Soviet Union. It was the law enforcement agency which did the will of the All Union Communist Party. The NKVD underwent many organizational changes; between 1938 and 1939 alone, the NKVD's structure changed three times.\nThe public face of the NKVD was the regular police force, which acted in a similar way to other police forces. In addition to its state security and police functions, some of its departments handled other matters, such as transportation, fire guards, border guards (NKVD border troops), etc. These jobs were usually assigned to the Ministry of the Interior (MVD).\nHowever, it is the classified (secret) activities for which it was really feared. This was the work of the Main Directorate for State Security, known as the GUGB. The NKVD also included the Soviet secret police. The GUGB protected the state security of the Soviet Union. This was done by massive political repression, including the use of sanctioned political murders and assassinations, especially in the era of Joseph Stalin, during the Great Purge.\nLater publications.\nAfter World War II, and especially after the end of the Soviet Union, there was a flood of books on the deeds of Stalin and the NKVD.\nDuring and after the war.\nIn the occupied territories, the NKVD (later KGB) carried out mass arrests, deportations, and executions. The targets included collaborators with Germany and non-Communist resistance movements. Resistance movements included the Polish Armia Krajowa and Ukrainian patriots aiming to separate from the Russian Soviet Union.\nThe NKVD also executed tens of thousands of Polish political prisoners in 1939\u20131941, including the Katy\u0144 massacre. NKVD units were also used to repress the partisan war in the Ukraine and the Baltics (which lasted until the early 1950s).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ministry_(government_department)","surface_form":"government department","offset":73},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":102},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":366},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":1099},{"uri":"Great_Purge","surface_form":"Great Purge","offset":1125},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1164},{"uri":"KGB","surface_form":"KGB","offset":1363},{"uri":"Armia_Krajowa","surface_form":"Armia Krajowa","offset":1553},{"uri":"NKVD_prisoner_massacres","surface_form":"Polish political prisoners","offset":1684},{"uri":"Katyn_massacre","surface_form":"Katy\u0144 massacre","offset":1739},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":1816},{"uri":"Baltic_states","surface_form":"Baltics","offset":1832}]}
