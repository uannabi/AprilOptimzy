{"id":57032,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis","text":"\"Yersinia pestis\" is a bacillus. It is a bacterium. It has been identified as the infectious agent of bubonic plague. This bacterium also causes other forms of plague- Septicemic plague and pneumonic plague. These three forms of the plague have been responsible for a high death toll in many epidemics throughout human history. These diseases are believed to be the cause of the Black Death. Because of the Black Death, about one third (one of three) people in Europe died. This was between 1347 and 1353.\nThe bacillus was discovered by the physician Alexandre Yersin during an epidemic of the plague in Hong Kong, in 1894. Yersin worked for the Pasteur Institute at the time. Originally, the microoganism was named \"Pasteurella pestis\". It was renamed in 1967.\nCurrently, three varieties of Y. pestis are known.\nHistorians are currently divided about the role of \"Y. pestis\" in the Black Death. Some historians said that the Black Death spread far too fast. Therefore, \"Y. pestis\" could not have caused it. DNA from \"Y. pestis\" has been found in the teeth of some of the victims of the Black Death. For this reason, \"Y. pestis\" must have been at least a factor in some (but not necessarily all) European plague epidemics.\nReferences.\nThese references are probably not in Simple English.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bacillus","surface_form":"bacillus","offset":23},{"uri":"Bacterium","surface_form":"bacterium","offset":41},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infectious agent","offset":82},{"uri":"Bubonic_plague","surface_form":"bubonic plague","offset":102},{"uri":"Septicemic_plague","surface_form":"Septicemic plague","offset":168},{"uri":"Pneumonic_plague","surface_form":"pneumonic plague","offset":190},{"uri":"Plague","surface_form":"plague","offset":233},{"uri":"Epidemic","surface_form":"epidemic","offset":292},{"uri":"Black_Death","surface_form":"Black Death","offset":379},{"uri":"1347","surface_form":"1347","offset":491},{"uri":"1353","surface_form":"1353","offset":500},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":541},{"uri":"Alexandre_Yersin","surface_form":"Alexandre Yersin","offset":551},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":604},{"uri":"1894","surface_form":"1894","offset":618},{"uri":"Pasteur_Institute","surface_form":"Pasteur Institute","offset":646},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":1008},{"uri":"Tooth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":1051}]}
