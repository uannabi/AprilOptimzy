It is a smaller relative of the better-known cougar, and has many local names.\nThe cat is still widespread throughout the Amazon Basin, and is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002. It is sometimes found in Mexico and southern Texas, and as far south as northern Argentina and these cats have been introduced to the state of Florida and state of Alabama in 1980's.\nJaguarundis are mostly daytime animals. They are comfortable in trees, but hunt on the ground.\nAccording to a 2006 genomic study of Felidae, an ancestor of today's \"Leopardus\", \"Lynx\", \"Puma\", \"Prionailurus\", and \"Felis\" lines migrated across the Bering land bridge into the Americas about 8.0 to 8.5 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"cat","offset":53},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central","offset":67},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":79},{"uri":"Cougar","surface_form":"cougar","offset":139},{"uri":"Amazon_Basin","surface_form":"Amazon Basin","offset":216},{"uri":"Least_concern","surface_form":"least concern","offset":247},{"uri":"IUCN_Red_List","surface_form":"IUCN Red List","offset":268},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":319},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":339},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":375},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":437},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":458},{"uri":"1980%27s","surface_form":"1980's","offset":469},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"genomic","offset":592},{"uri":"Leopardus","surface_form":"Leopardus","offset":642},{"uri":"Lynx","surface_form":"Lynx","offset":655},{"uri":"Puma","surface_form":"Puma","offset":663},{"uri":"Prionailurus","surface_form":"Prionailurus","offset":671},{"uri":"Felis","surface_form":"Felis","offset":691},{"uri":"Beringia","surface_form":"Bering land bridge","offset":724},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":752}]}
