{"id":570596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmosome","text":"A desmosome is a cell structure for cell-to-cell adhesion. They are localized spot-like adhesions on the outer sides of plasma membranes.\nDesmosomes help to keep cells together in a sheet. They are found in epithelial tissue, like multilayer squamous epithelium. The intercellular space is relatively wide up to about 30\u00A0nm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Adhesion","surface_form":"adhesion","offset":49},{"uri":"Plasma_membrane","surface_form":"plasma membrane","offset":120},{"uri":"Epithelium","surface_form":"epithelial tissue","offset":207},{"uri":"Squamous_epithelium","surface_form":"squamous epithelium","offset":242}]}
