{"id":570739,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_MSG90","text":"The Heckler & Koch MSG90 is a semi-automatic military sniper rifle. It is based on the PSG1 from Heckler & Koch. The MSG90 shoots 7.62\u00D751mm NATO ammunition. MSG90 stands for \"Militarisch Scharfschutzen Gewehr\". The 1990 part is the year was the sniper rifle was made.\nHistory.\nThe Heckler & Koch MSG90 was first introduced in 1987. It uses a delayed blowback design the same as many other H&K rifles. Based on the Heckler & Koch PSG1, it is designed for military and police use. It was designed to meet the military specifications of the US Army's M24 Sniper Weapon System.\nIt has several improvements over the PSG1. The barrel is lighter and shorter. It is made using the cold hammer forging process. The stock is adjustable and of a different shape. The trigger is wider and has a trigger pull set from the factory. It does not have open sights but comes with a 10-power Telescopic sight.\nWhere the PSG1 did not stand up to rough handling on the battlefield, the MSG90 is designed just for that kind of service. The model MSG90A1 has a threaded barrel designed to accept a suppressor. The later MSG90A2 was a lighter and sturdier design.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semi-automatic_rifle","surface_form":"semi-automatic","offset":30},{"uri":"Sniper_rifle","surface_form":"sniper rifle","offset":54},{"uri":"Heckler_%26amp%3B_Koch_PSG1","surface_form":"PSG1","offset":87},{"uri":"Heckler_%26amp%3B_Koch","surface_form":"Heckler & Koch","offset":97},{"uri":"7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO","surface_form":"7.62\u00D751mm NATO","offset":130},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammunition","offset":145},{"uri":"Blowback_(firearms)","surface_form":"blowback","offset":350},{"uri":"Heckler_%26amp%3B_Koch_PSG1","surface_form":"Heckler & Koch PSG1","offset":414},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":467},{"uri":"United_States_Military_Standard","surface_form":"military specifications","offset":507},{"uri":"US_Army","surface_form":"US Army","offset":538},{"uri":"M24_Sniper_Weapon_System","surface_form":"M24 Sniper Weapon System","offset":548},{"uri":"Barrel_(weapons)","surface_form":"barrel","offset":621},{"uri":"Forging","surface_form":"cold hammer forging","offset":673},{"uri":"Stock_(firearms)","surface_form":"stock","offset":706},{"uri":"Adjustable","surface_form":"adjustable","offset":715},{"uri":"Trigger","surface_form":"trigger","offset":756},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"factory","offset":809},{"uri":"Sight_(device)","surface_form":"sight","offset":840},{"uri":"Scope","surface_form":"Telescopic sight","offset":873},{"uri":"Battlefield","surface_form":"battlefield","offset":948},{"uri":"Suppressor","surface_form":"suppressor","offset":1075}]}
