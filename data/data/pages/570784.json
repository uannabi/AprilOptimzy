It is a major junction on the West Coast Main Line and acts as a rail gateway for North West England. It is a Grade II listed building.\nThe station is managed by Avanti West Coast, who also provide the majority of trains that stop there. Northern Trains, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Trains and Transport for Wales also provide regular trains from the station. CrossCountry provide one early morning train a day.\nCrewe's location was chosen after fellow Cheshire towns Winsford and Nantwich had rejected a proposal for the station to be built there.\nAs a result of the station's significance, the town of Crewe is now famous for its railways and railway infrastructure. The town's football club, Crewe Alexandra, are nicknamed \"The Railwaymen\" in reference.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":27},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":50},{"uri":"Crewe","surface_form":"Crewe","offset":58},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":67},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":77},{"uri":"1837","surface_form":"1837","offset":99},{"uri":"Junction","surface_form":"junction","offset":279},{"uri":"West_Coast_Main_Line","surface_form":"West Coast Main Line","offset":295},{"uri":"North_West_England","surface_form":"North West England","offset":347},{"uri":"Listed_buildings","surface_form":"listed building","offset":384},{"uri":"Avanti_West_Coast","surface_form":"Avanti West Coast","offset":427},{"uri":"Northern_Trains","surface_form":"Northern Trains","offset":503},{"uri":"East_Midlands_Railway","surface_form":"East Midlands Railway","offset":520},{"uri":"West_Midlands_Trains","surface_form":"West Midlands Trains","offset":543},{"uri":"Transport_for_Wales_Rail_Services","surface_form":"Transport for Wales","offset":568},{"uri":"CrossCountry","surface_form":"CrossCountry","offset":634},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":727},{"uri":"Winsford","surface_form":"Winsford","offset":742},{"uri":"Nantwich","surface_form":"Nantwich","offset":755},{"uri":"Crewe","surface_form":"Crewe","offset":878},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":954},{"uri":"Crewe_Alexandra_F.C.","surface_form":"Crewe Alexandra","offset":969}]}
