It is sometimes called the \"unity\". It is also the only number for which these special facts are true.\nIn mathematics, 0.999... is a repeating decimal that is mathematically equal to 1. Many proofs have been made to show this is correct.\nComputer science.\nThe number \"one\" is important for computer science, because the binary numeral system uses only 1s and 0s. In machine code and many programming languages, one means true and zero means false.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":13},{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":34},{"uri":"2_(number)","surface_form":"two","offset":50},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":57},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":81},{"uri":"Nose","surface_form":"nose","offset":87},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":93},{"uri":"Umbilicus","surface_form":"navel","offset":104},{"uri":"Roman_numeral","surface_form":"Roman numeral","offset":130},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":176},{"uri":"Multiplicative_identity","surface_form":"multiplicative identity","offset":198},{"uri":"0.999...","surface_form":"0.999...","offset":360},{"uri":"Repeating_decimal","surface_form":"repeating decimal","offset":374},{"uri":"Mathematical_proof","surface_form":"proofs","offset":432},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":531},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":561},{"uri":"Machine_code","surface_form":"machine code","offset":607},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":629}]}
