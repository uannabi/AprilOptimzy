Its capital is the city of Apt.\nHistory.\nWhen the Vaucluse department was created on 1793, the \"arrondissement\" of Apt was part of that original department. In 1926, the subprefecture of Apt was moved to Cavaillon but returned to Apt in 1933.\nGeography.\nThe \"arrondissement\" of Apt is in the most southern of the \"arrondissements\" of the Vaucluse department. It has the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department to the east, the Var department to the southeast (for a very short distance), the Bouches-du-Rh\u00F4ne department to the south and west, the Avignon \"arrondissement\" to the northwest and the Carpentras \"arrondissement\" to the north.\nThe \"arrondissement\" of Apt is the largest \"arrondissement\" of the department in area, but the one with fewest people living in it (128,448 inhabitants) and a density of inhabitants/km\u00B2.\nCantons.\nAfter the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the \"arrondissements\" so they could have \"communes\" that belong to different \"arrondissements\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"arrondissement","offset":32},{"uri":"Vaucluse","surface_form":"Vaucluse","offset":65},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":74},{"uri":"Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te_d%27Azur","surface_form":"Provence-Alpes-C\u00F4te d'Azur","offset":86},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":113},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":125},{"uri":"Apt%2C_Vaucluse","surface_form":"Apt","offset":148},{"uri":"Alpes-de-Haute-Provence","surface_form":"Alpes-de-Haute-Provence","offset":491},{"uri":"Var_(department)","surface_form":"Var","offset":543},{"uri":"Bouches-du-Rh%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Bouches-du-Rh\u00F4ne","offset":608},{"uri":"Arrondissement_of_Avignon","surface_form":"Avignon","offset":663},{"uri":"Arrondissement_of_Carpentras","surface_form":"Carpentras","offset":713},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"density","offset":914}]}
