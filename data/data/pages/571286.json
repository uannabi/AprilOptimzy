{"id":571286,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy","text":"=\"preserve\">A convoy is a group of vehicles, typically motor vehicles or ships, traveling together for mutual support and protection. Often, a convoy is organized with armed defensive support. Civilian convoys may be organized, for example when driving through remote areas. A convoy also allows an organized group to arrive together with their equipment. They can start working together immediately, for example at an emergency. A convoy on land is sometimes called a caravan.\nConvoys at sea came into widespread use when warships were made as a different kind of ship. They endangered enemy merchant ships that were not protected by friendly warships.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":35},{"uri":"Emergency","surface_form":"emergency","offset":419},{"uri":"Caravan_(travellers)","surface_form":"caravan.","offset":469},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warship","offset":523}]}
