{"id":5713,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen","text":"\"God Save the Queen\" has been the national anthem of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland since 1745. Its also the royal anthem of the Commonwealth realms, played alongside their official national anthems. Its composer remains unknown to this date.\nWhen the ruling monarch is a king instead of a queen, the title of the anthem then becomes \"God Save the King\".\nThe tune for \"God Save the Queen\" was used in many countries as a national anthem. Apart from the German state, many of which were linked to Great Britain by marriage, Liechtenstein and Switzerland used the tune. Switzerland changed to a different tune in the 1960s. Liechtenstein still uses the tune.\nThe tune is both American and British. In the 1930s the United States chose an official anthem. \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was chosen instead of the equally popular \"My Country 'tis of Thee\" which used the \"God Save the Queen\" tune.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["anthem"],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":34},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","offset":57},{"uri":"1745","surface_form":"1745","offset":109},{"uri":"Royal_anthem","surface_form":"royal anthem","offset":128},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realm","surface_form":"Commonwealth realm","offset":148},{"uri":"Liechtenstein","surface_form":"Liechtenstein","offset":542},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":587},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":732},{"uri":"The_Star-Spangled_Banner","surface_form":"The Star-Spangled Banner","offset":773},{"uri":"My_Country_%27tis_of_Thee","surface_form":"My Country 'tis of Thee","offset":842}]}
