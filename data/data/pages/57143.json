His name, \"Pendragon\", means the \"Chief-Dragon\", which means he is the \"foremost leader\" or \"chief of warriors\". He is mentioned briefly in Old Welsh poems, but his biography was first written down by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"). Geoffrey's description of him has been used in most later stories.\nAccording to the stories, Arthur is the son of Uther Prendragon and the Lady Igraine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_Arthur","surface_form":"King Arthur","offset":33},{"uri":"Old_Welsh_language","surface_form":"Old Welsh","offset":210},{"uri":"Medieval_Welsh_literature","surface_form":"poems","offset":220},{"uri":"Biography","surface_form":"biography","offset":235},{"uri":"Geoffrey_of_Monmouth","surface_form":"Geoffrey of Monmouth","offset":271},{"uri":"Historia_Regum_Britanniae","surface_form":"Historia Regum Britanniae","offset":300},{"uri":"Igraine","surface_form":"Igraine","offset":508}]}
