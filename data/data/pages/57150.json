Wetsuits act as insulation invented by Jack O'Neill, and help the body to retain its heat. Wetsuits are made of plastic or rubber materials such as neoprene. Wetsuits include torso coverings, leggings, head coverings, and hand and feet coverings.\nPartial wetsuits.\nWhen people are doing diving or water sports in areas where the water is not very cold, they may only wear some parts of a wetsuit, such as a torso covering or leggings.\nWet suits are garments that oceangoers wear!\nIt's very vital when going to the ocean and dive because it serves as a life and system protector.\nFull wetsuits.\nDeepwater divers often wear full wetsuits that include torso coverings, leggings, head coverings, and hand and feet coverings.
