{"id":571547,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabesque","text":"Arabesque is an artistic decoration. It uses \"surface decorations based on... interlacing foliage, tendrils\" or plain lines. Another definition is \"Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves... combined with spiralling stems\".\nArabesques are usually of a single design which can be 'tiled' or repeated as many times as desired.\nThe term \"arabesque\" is used as a technical term by art historians for decoration in Islamic art from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the Renaissance onwards. Note that Islamic geometric patterns are a different style from arabesques.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Decoration","surface_form":"decoration","offset":25},{"uri":"Foliage","surface_form":"foliage","offset":90},{"uri":"Tendril","surface_form":"tendrils","offset":99},{"uri":"Art_historian","surface_form":"art historian","offset":405},{"uri":"Islamic_art","surface_form":"Islamic art","offset":438},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":523}]}
