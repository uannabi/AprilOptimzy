When Lichtenstein retired, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation made the decision to honor his considerable accomplishments by foregoing its own naming rights and dedicating the BAM Harvey Theater in his honor.\nLichtenstein was born in Brooklyn, New York. He studied at Brooklyn College and at Black Mountain College. Lichtenstein died in Manhattan, New York on February 11, 2017 from complications of a stroke, aged 87.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music","surface_form":"Brooklyn Academy of Music","offset":199},{"uri":"Next_Wave_Festival","surface_form":"Next Wave Festival","offset":330},{"uri":"Doris_Duke_Charitable_Foundation","surface_form":"Doris Duke Charitable Foundation","offset":481},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":686},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":696},{"uri":"Brooklyn_College","surface_form":"Brooklyn College","offset":720},{"uri":"Black_Mountain_College","surface_form":"Black Mountain College","offset":744},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":789},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":854}]}
