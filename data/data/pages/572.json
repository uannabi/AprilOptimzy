It was first sung in French in 1880. Robert Stanley Weir wrote English words for the song in 1908.\nIt was sung as the national anthem for many years before the government made it official on 1 July (Canada Day) in 1980.\nO Canada! Our home and native land,\nTrue patriot love in all of us command!\nWith glowing hearts we see thee rise\nThe True North strong and free,\nFrom far and wide, O Canada,\nWe stand on guard for thee.\nGod keep our land glorious and free!\nO Canada, we stand on guard for thee;\nO Canada, we stand on guard for thee.\nHere are the words in French. The words in French and English do not mean the same thing.\n\u00D4 Canada! Terre de nos a\u00EFeux,\nTon front est ceint de fleurons glorieux!\nCar ton bras sait porter l'\u00E9p\u00E9e,\nEt ta valeur de foi tremp\u00E9e\nProt\u00E9gera nos foyers et nos droits;\nProt\u00E9gera nos foyers et nos droits.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":29},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":48},{"uri":"Calixa_Lavall%C3%A9e","surface_form":"Calixa Lavall\u00E9e","offset":56},{"uri":"Adolphe-Basile_Routhier","surface_form":"Adolphe-Basile Routhier","offset":89},{"uri":"Robert_Stanley_Weir","surface_form":"Robert Stanley Weir","offset":177},{"uri":"1_July","surface_form":"1 July","offset":331},{"uri":"Canada_Day","surface_form":"Canada Day","offset":339}]}
