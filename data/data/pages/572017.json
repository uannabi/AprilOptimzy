{"id":572017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goyescas","text":"\"Goyescas\" is a Spanish opera with music by Enrique Granados and libretto by Fernando Periquet y Zuaznabar. It is based on the piano work by Granados which is also called \"Goyescas\". As the melodies had already been created for the piano work, the words of the opera had to be chosen to fit them.\nThe opera was first performed in New York, on January 28, 1916. It is not performed as often as the piano version.\nStory.\nGranados was inspired by the paintings of Francisco Goya.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":16},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":24},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":35},{"uri":"Enrique_Granados","surface_form":"Enrique Granados","offset":44},{"uri":"Libretto","surface_form":"libretto","offset":65},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":330},{"uri":"Francisco_Goya","surface_form":"Francisco Goya","offset":461}]}
