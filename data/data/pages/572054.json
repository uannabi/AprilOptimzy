{"id":572054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stef%C3%A1n_Karl_Stef%C3%A1nsson","text":"Stef\u00E1n Karl Stef\u00E1nsson (;; 10 July 1975 \u2013 21 August 2018) was an Icelandic actor and singer. He was best known for playing antagonist Robbie Rotten on the children's television series \"LazyTown\".\nCareer.\nStef\u00E1n Karl's career started in 1994. At the age of 19, he worked as a puppeteer for television. During his years as a puppeteer, he had also been studying at the Drama Academy of Iceland. However, he was not satisfied with how Iceland views their drama standards. He remembers that his principal at his high school said that \"acting is not about making faces and changing your face\". He did not agree with his high school principal.\nLater, Stef\u00E1n Karl had been invited by Magn\u00FAs Scheving, an Icelandic gymnast, to portray one of the characters in the second \"LazyTown\" play. Scheving created the plays because he was concerned that Iceland's younger generation is not doing enough exercise. Stef\u00E1n Karl explained that \"[Scheving] wanted the kids to get healthier, so he created this musical called \"LazyTown\". He played Sportacus, the fitness fanatic, and I was Robbie Rotten, the guy who liked to stay indoors and sleep\". After initial success with the musical, Nickelodeon eventually made a deal with the creators of \"LazyTown\" to air the first 40 episodes of \"LazyTown\" along with a special studio built in Iceland. During the first few years of \"LazyTown\" in the early 2000s, Stef\u00E1n Karl initially knew no English, but soon became fluent.\nPersonal life.\nStef\u00E1n Karl lived in Los Angeles with his wife Steinunn \u00D3l\u00EDna \u00DEorsteinsd\u00F3ttir, three daughters, and one son. In June 2018, he was awarded the Order of the Falcon.\nIllness and death.\nStef\u00E1n Karl announced in October 2016 that he had been diagnosed with bile duct cancer. On the same month, GoFundMe campaign was subsequently created by \"LazyTown\" head writer Mark Valenti to pay his living costs when he became too ill to work. The campaign was popularized by various YouTube users uploading parodies of Stef\u00E1n Karl's work. This eventually made the songs \"We Are Number One\" and \"The Mine Song\" from \"LazyTown\" become Internet memes. In August 2017, Stef\u00E1n Karl stated he was in remission. He clarified on his GoFundMe campaign that while his metastases had been removed after successful liver surgery in June 2017, he still had the disease and had refused further adjuvant therapy.\nIn March 2018, Stef\u00E1n Karl was diagnosed with inoperable bile duct cancer, and said that he was undergoing chemotherapy to increase the length of his life. In April 2018, he announced that he personally chose to stop his chemotherapy, and then began to shut down all his social media accounts.\nHe died on 21 August 2018 at the age of 43. His wife stated that Stefansson didn't want to a funeral when he died. Instead, she had said that his body will be secretly scattered into a distant ocean.\nIt was announced by his manager, Cheryl Edison, that the Stef\u00E1n Karl Academy & Center for the Performing Arts will be opened in Switzerland in the year 2019 as a memorial to his career.\nFilmography.\nStef\u00E1n Karl has been credited in various works including plays, television series, films, and games.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Robbie_Rotten","surface_form":"Robbie Rotten","offset":134},{"uri":"LazyTown","surface_form":"LazyTown","offset":185},{"uri":"Magn%C3%BAs_Scheving","surface_form":"Magn\u00FAs Scheving","offset":677},{"uri":"LazyTown","surface_form":"LazyTown","offset":764},{"uri":"Sportacus","surface_form":"Sportacus","offset":1025},{"uri":"Nickelodeon","surface_form":"Nickelodeon","offset":1168},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1484},{"uri":"Steinunn_%C3%93l%C3%ADna_%C3%9Eorsteinsd%C3%B3ttir","surface_form":"Steinunn \u00D3l\u00EDna \u00DEorsteinsd\u00F3ttir","offset":1510},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Falcon","surface_form":"Order of the Falcon","offset":1605},{"uri":"Cholangiocarcinoma","surface_form":"bile duct cancer","offset":1715},{"uri":"GoFundMe","surface_form":"GoFundMe","offset":1752},{"uri":"Mark_Valenti","surface_form":"Mark Valenti","offset":1821},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":1930},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parodies","offset":1954},{"uri":"We_Are_Number_One","surface_form":"We Are Number One","offset":2018},{"uri":"Internet_meme","surface_form":"Internet meme","offset":2080},{"uri":"Remission_(medicine)","surface_form":"remission","offset":2141},{"uri":"Metastasis","surface_form":"metastases","offset":2205},{"uri":"Adjuvant_therapy","surface_form":"adjuvant therapy","offset":2327},{"uri":"Cholangiocarcinoma","surface_form":"bile duct cancer","offset":2402},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":2452},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":3001}]}
