{"id":57213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_8","text":"=\"preserve\">Live 8 was a rock concert organized by activist Bob Geldof. The concert took place in nine places at once on July 2, 2005. Like Bob's Live Aid concert, Live 8 was made for helping out African citizens who were not getting enough food and medicine. However, this concert was not for charity. Instead, it was held to make people aware of the famine in Africa. Bob wanted to make the political group named the G8 give more to Africa. The concerts featured singers like Paul McCartney, Juan Diego Fl\u00F3rez and U2.\nIn November 2005, the concerts were released on DVD. The money used to buy the DVD sets was also used to help Africans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":51},{"uri":"Bob_Geldof","surface_form":"Bob Geldof","offset":60},{"uri":"July_2","surface_form":"July 2","offset":121},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":129},{"uri":"Live_Aid","surface_form":"Live Aid","offset":146},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":196},{"uri":"Charity_(practice)","surface_form":"charity","offset":294},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":352},{"uri":"G8","surface_form":"G8","offset":419},{"uri":"Paul_McCartney","surface_form":"Paul McCartney","offset":478},{"uri":"Juan_Diego_Fl%C3%B3rez","surface_form":"Juan Diego Fl\u00F3rez","offset":494},{"uri":"U2","surface_form":"U2","offset":516},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":568}]}
