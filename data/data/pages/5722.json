{"id":5722,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E","text":"E is the fifth (number 5) letter in the English alphabet.\nIn English it has two possible sounds when it is spoken. Usually it is a short E (\u0115), but sometimes it is a long E (\u0113).\nOne more thing in English is the so-called magic E. That is when a silent e at the end of a word makes the previous e long. Example: morpheme, which is pronounced as morph\u0113m.\nTypographic variants of E.\nThe variants of E include (but may not be limited to)\n\u00E9 \u00C8 \u00E8 \u00CA \u00EA \u00CB\n\u00C9 \u00EB \u011A \u011B \u0112 \u0113\n\u0114 \u0115 \u0116 \u0117 \u0118 \u0119\n\"None\" of these variants are used in English, except occasionally \u00C9/\u00E9 for some French words.\nMeanings for E.\nThese meanings are for E/e as a separate letter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"5_(number)","surface_form":"5","offset":23},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":26},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":40},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":48},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":61},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":507},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":549}]}
