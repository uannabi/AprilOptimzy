{"id":572318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoi_festival","text":"The Aoi Festival or Aoi Matsuri(\u8475\u796D) is one of\u00A0Kyoto's three most famous\u00A0festivals\u00A0(along with the\u00A0Gion Festival\u00A0and\u00A0Jidai Matsuri) and takes place every May 15. The festival's main attraction is a large parade in Kyoto, in which over 500 people dressed in the aristocratic style of the\u00A0Heian Period\u00A0(794-1185) walk from the\u00A0Imperial Palace\u00A0to the\u00A0Kamo Shrines. Aoi is\u00A0Japanese\u00A0for Hollyhock, and the festival is named after the Hollyhock leaves that are worn by the members of the procession.\nPredating\u00A0Kyoto's establishment as the national capital in\u00A0794, the Aoi Matsuri began in the 7th century, although its precise origins are uncertain. There were most likely natural disasters occurring that were believed to be caused by the deities of the\u00A0Kamo Shrines. After the\u00A0Emperor\u00A0made offerings to the gods, the disasters subsided and a tradition was begun. The festival's official name remains Kamo Matsuri, because of its association with the shrines.\nThe festival grew in prominence so that during the\u00A0Heian Period\u00A0the word festival became synonymous with the Aoi Matsuri. Nowadays, the massive procession illustrates the high regard in which the festival would have been held. There are men on horseback, giant bouquets of flowers, ornately decorated ox drawn carts, and a large retinue of women in kimono accompanying the year's Saio.\nTraditionally, the\u00A0Saio\u00A0was a young female member of the\u00A0imperial family\u00A0who was the high priestess of the Kamo Shrines. During festivals, the Saio performed rituals at the shrines. In the modern era, a different unmarried woman from Kyoto is selected each year to be Saio. She must go through purification ceremonies before the festival, and is taken through the procession on a palanquin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kyoto","surface_form":"Kyoto","offset":46},{"uri":"Gion_Festival","surface_form":"Gion Festival","offset":98},{"uri":"Jidai_Matsuri","surface_form":"Jidai Matsuri","offset":116},{"uri":"Heian_Period","surface_form":"Heian Period","offset":286},{"uri":"Kimono","surface_form":"kimono","offset":1303}]}
