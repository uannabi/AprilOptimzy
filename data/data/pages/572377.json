{"id":572377,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_stick","text":"A Hot stick is a tool used by Utility Workers (known as Linemen or Linesmen) dealing with high voltage electricity. It is an insulated pole made usually from Fiberglass, measuring anywhere from 5ft-10ft, up to about 40ft in length. It can have different tools attached to the end of it, making it possible to do everything from tightening bolts and nuts, through to testing voltage or removing and replacing s.\nHot sticks are usually used when the installation being worked on is live, or \"hot\". Most electrical work on High Voltage networks is done whilst the power is still active, making equipment like this a very important piece for safety purposes. Working \"hot\" saves electricity users from being disconnected while routine maintenance is taking place.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Public_utility","surface_form":"Utility","offset":30},{"uri":"Lineman_(technician)","surface_form":"Linemen or Linesmen","offset":56},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"high voltage","offset":90},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":103},{"uri":"Fiberglass","surface_form":"Fiberglass","offset":158},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":374},{"uri":"Fuse","surface_form":"s","offset":408}]}
