{"id":572467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowjacket","text":"The yellowjacket (or yellow jacket) is a wasp from the genera \"Vespula\" and \"Dolichovespula\". In some English-speaking countries, they are called wasps. Most are black and yellow. Some are black and white.\nYellowjackets are sometimes confused with bees because they have rather similar colouring. Yellowjackets have a stinger with a small barb. They may sting repeatedly.\nThe diet of an adult yellowjacket is usually sugars and carbohydrates. They are important predators of other insects because they feed their larvae (grubs) with chewed-up insects.\nThey are native to North America and parts of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wasp","surface_form":"wasp","offset":41},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":55},{"uri":"Vespula","surface_form":"Vespula","offset":63},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":102},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":376},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":417},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":428},{"uri":"Native_(ecology)","surface_form":"native to","offset":561},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":571},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":598},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":606},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":620}]}
