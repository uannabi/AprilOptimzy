{"id":572716,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid","text":"Pyruvic acid is the simplest of the keto acids, with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group. Pyruvate, the conjugate base, is an important part of several metabolic chemical reactions. Pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry.\nPyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis. One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate. These are then used to give more energy to living animals, plants and microorganisms. It is then changed back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) by a metabolic chemical reaction named gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through a similar reaction. It can also be used to make the amino acid alanine and can be converted into ethanol or lactic acid by fermentation.\nPyruvic acid gives energy to cells through the citric acid cycle, when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and also makes lactate when oxygen is lacking (fermentation).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"acid","offset":41},{"uri":"Carboxylic_acid","surface_form":"carboxylic acid","offset":55},{"uri":"Ketone","surface_form":"ketone","offset":77},{"uri":"Functional_group","surface_form":"functional group","offset":84},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"conjugate base","offset":116},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolic","offset":164},{"uri":"Chemical_reactions","surface_form":"chemical reactions","offset":174},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":219},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":240},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":284},{"uri":"Glycolysis","surface_form":"glycolysis","offset":300},{"uri":"Glucose","surface_form":"glucose","offset":328},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"microorganism","offset":450},{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":493},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolic","offset":530},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":540},{"uri":"Fatty_acid","surface_form":"fatty acid","offset":587},{"uri":"Alanine","surface_form":"alanine","offset":670},{"uri":"Ethanol","surface_form":"ethanol","offset":704},{"uri":"Lactic_acid","surface_form":"lactic acid","offset":715},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":730},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":773},{"uri":"Citric_acid_cycle","surface_form":"citric acid cycle","offset":791},{"uri":"Aerobic_respiration","surface_form":"aerobic respiration","offset":834},{"uri":"Lactic_acid","surface_form":"lactate","offset":871},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":903}]}
