It was first discovered by Thomas Hodgkin in 1832. It is one of many kinds of cancers of the lymphatic system. Most of the time, the cancer develops in a single lymph node before it spreads to the rest of the body. The symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma change as the disease progresses. At the first stage of the disease, the person may feel a lump on the affected lymph node that does not hurt when touched. The person may have strange fevers, sweating during the night, and itchy skin. In the later stages of the disease, the person may feel very tired and their spleen may grow larger. In simple words Hodgkin lymphoma is a malignant neoplasm with features resembling an inflammatory disorder, such features include fever, and inflammatory cell infiltrates.\nIt mainly affects the young adults especially young men with exception of nodular sclerosis which frequently affects young women. The important histological finding is the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["disease"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lymphatic_system","surface_form":"lymphatic system","offset":72},{"uri":"Lymphoma","surface_form":"lymphoma","offset":106},{"uri":"Thomas_Hodgkin","surface_form":"Thomas Hodgkin","offset":143},{"uri":"Lymph_node","surface_form":"lymph node","offset":277},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":550},{"uri":"Spleen","surface_form":"spleen","offset":678}]}
