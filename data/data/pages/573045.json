{"id":573045,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_chromosome","text":"B chromosomes are chromosomes which are not needed for the life of a species. They are also called 'supernumerary' or 'accessory chromosomes'.\nIn addition to normal chromosomes (the karyotype), many species have B chromosomes. Wild populations of many animal, plant, and fungi species have B chromosomes. These chromosomes are not essential for their life, and are lacking in many individuals. So a population might have individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3 (etc.) supernumeraries.\nMost B chromosomes are mainly or entirely heterochromatic, and so do not code for anything. Some, such as the B chromosomes of maize, contain sizeable euchromatic segments, and therefore do code for some products.\nIt seems unlikely that supernumeraries would survive in a species unless there was some positive advantage. In a few cases this has been identified. For instance, the British grasshopper \"Myrmeleotettix maculatus\" has B chromosomes with a satellite DNA. They occur in warm, dry environments, and are scarce or absent in humid, cooler places.\nIt is thought that B chromosomes are parasitic elements like selfish DNA. Various scenarios have been suggested as to how they arose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chromosomes","surface_form":"chromosomes","offset":18},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":69},{"uri":"Karyotype","surface_form":"karyotype","offset":182},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":271},{"uri":"Chromosomes","surface_form":"chromosomes","offset":311},{"uri":"Heterochromatin","surface_form":"heterochromatic","offset":515},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":600},{"uri":"Euchromatin","surface_form":"euchromatic","offset":624},{"uri":"Grasshopper","surface_form":"grasshopper","offset":862},{"uri":"Satellite_DNA","surface_form":"satellite DNA","offset":926},{"uri":"Parasitic","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":1066},{"uri":"Selfish_DNA","surface_form":"selfish DNA","offset":1090},{"uri":"Scenario","surface_form":"scenario","offset":1111}]}
