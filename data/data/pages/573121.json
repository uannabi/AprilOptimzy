He was strongly against the Oslo Accords and targeted Rabin because of his peace efforts with the Palestinians, which he saw as against the interests of Israeli Jews.\nAmir is an Orthodox Jew from a Yemenite Jewish background. At the time of the murder he was studying law and computer science at Bar-Ilan University and also Jewish law.\nBecause he murdered the country's head of government, this made Amir an assassin. He was found guilty and sent to prison, where he still is. Israel does not have the death penalty. He is not considered a terrorist because he never took action against anyone else.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":12},{"uri":"Herzliya","surface_form":"Herzliya","offset":55},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":71},{"uri":"Murderer","surface_form":"murderer","offset":79},{"uri":"Life_sentence","surface_form":"life sentence","offset":107},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":124},{"uri":"Israeli_Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Israeli Prime Minister","offset":149},{"uri":"Yitzhak_Rabin","surface_form":"Yitzhak Rabin","offset":172},{"uri":"Oslo_Accords","surface_form":"Oslo Accords","offset":265},{"uri":"Palestinians","surface_form":"Palestinians","offset":335},{"uri":"Orthodox_Judaism","surface_form":"Orthodox Jew","offset":415},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":435},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":444},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":482},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":513},{"uri":"Bar-Ilan_University","surface_form":"Bar-Ilan University","offset":533},{"uri":"Jewish_law","surface_form":"Jewish law","offset":562},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":608},{"uri":"Assassin","surface_form":"assassin","offset":646},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"death penalty","offset":740},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":778}]}
