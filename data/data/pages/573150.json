{"id":573150,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCscher_color_test","text":"e=\"preserve\">The L\u00FCscher color test is a psychological test invented by Dr. Max L\u00FCscher in Basel, Switzerland. L\u00FCscher believed that sensory perception of color is \"all shared by all\", but that color preferences are not. This difference allows subjective states to be objectively measured by using test colors.\nL\u00FCscher believed that because the color selections are guided in a specific manner, they reveal the person as they really are, not as they perceive themselves or would like to be perceived.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychological_test","surface_form":"psychological test","offset":41},{"uri":"Max_L%C3%BCscher","surface_form":"Max L\u00FCscher","offset":76},{"uri":"Basel","surface_form":"Basel","offset":91},{"uri":"Sensory_perception","surface_form":"sensory perception","offset":133},{"uri":"Color_preferences","surface_form":"color preferences","offset":194},{"uri":"Subjective","surface_form":"subjective","offset":244}]}
