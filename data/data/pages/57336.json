{"id":57336,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House","text":"The Sydney Opera House is an opera house and iconic building on the shores of Sydney Harbour, in Sydney, Australia. It is shaped like the sails of a boat. Many concerts and events take place there, with 2000 performances a year presented by Opera Australia, Australia's national opera company. It is a famous tourist attraction.\nHistory.\nThe land where the Sydney Opera House stands is called Bennelong Point. Bennelong Point was once home to Fort Macquarie (the fort was built in 1817 and knocked down in 1901). On 10 August 1902, the Fort Macquarie Tram Depot was opened at Bennelong Point. The depot was knocked down in 1958. The Sydney Opera House was built on the same spot and the work began in 1959.\nIt was designed by Danish architect J\u00F8rn Utzon. He won a design competition in 1957. Utzon left the project in February 1966 because the government was not paying his invoices. The building finally opened on 20 October in 1973. The project was completed ten years later and cost more than fourteen times the original budget. In 2001, Utzon was invited back to restore the building and change it back towards his original designs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opera_house","surface_form":"opera house","offset":29},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":52},{"uri":"Sydney_Harbour","surface_form":"Sydney Harbour","offset":78},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":97},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":105},{"uri":"Sail","surface_form":"sail","offset":138},{"uri":"Attraction","surface_form":"attraction","offset":317},{"uri":"Tram","surface_form":"Tram","offset":551},{"uri":"J%C3%B8rn_Utzon","surface_form":"J\u00F8rn Utzon","offset":743},{"uri":"Design_competition","surface_form":"design competition","offset":764},{"uri":"20_October","surface_form":"20 October","offset":915}]}
