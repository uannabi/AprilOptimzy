Its only characters are Socrates and Crito.\nIt centers around the moral consequences of helping Socrates escape from prison. Socrates argues against defying the law, even though Crito is willing to help him. Eventually Socrates convinces Crito that morally, Socrates must stay in prison and accept his execution.\nPlato, who had been a student of Socrates, wrote this dialogue among many others. Socrates is often a character of Plato's works, and the dialogue between Crito and Socrates is based on the death of Socrates. Socrates did in fact get executed by drinking hemlock.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":84},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":97},{"uri":"Socrates","surface_form":"Socrates","offset":125},{"uri":"Hemlock","surface_form":"hemlock","offset":669}]}
