People can cross the bridge by car, walking or by train. It now carries eight traffic lanes. Using six intended traffic lanes and an additional two that were formally tram tracks.\nThere are two railway lanes that head in opposite directions. There is a tunnel that goes underneath. The bridge is an important tourist attraction. The scenery attracts many tourists and people living in or near the city. One of the many attractions of the Harbour Bridge is its famous 'BridgeClimb'. Luna Park Sydney is located next to the bridge.\nThe bridge is long and wide. The highest point of the arch is tall. Building began on 19 March 1923 and ended in 1932. John Bradfield led the bridge's building.\nThe standards of industrial safety during construction were poor by today's standards. Sixteen workers died during construction,<a href=\"Sydney_Harbour_Bridge%23cite_note-7bwh4-31\">a></a>\u00A0but surprisingly only two from falling off the bridge. Several more were injured from unsafe working practices undertaken whilst heating and inserting its rivets, and the deafness experienced by many of the workers in later years was blamed on the project.\nHenri Mallard\u00A0between 1930 and 1932 produced hundreds of stills<a href=\"Sydney_Harbour_Bridge%23cite_note-32\">a></a>\u00A0and film footage<a href=\"Sydney_Harbour_Bridge%23cite_note-33\">a></a>\u00A0which reveal at close quarters the bravery of the workers in tough Depression-era conditions.[\"citation needed\"]\nThe total financial cost of the bridge was\u00A0AU\u00A36.25 million, which was not paid off in full until 1988.<a href=\"Sydney_Harbour_Bridge%23cite_note-34\">a></a>","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sydney_Harbour","surface_form":"Sydney Harbour","offset":30},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":51},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":75},{"uri":"Tourist_attraction","surface_form":"tourist attraction","offset":410},{"uri":"Luna_Park_Sydney","surface_form":"Luna Park Sydney","offset":583},{"uri":"Henri_Mallard","surface_form":"Henri Mallard","offset":1237},{"uri":"Citation_needed","surface_form":"citation needed","offset":1519},{"uri":"Australian_pound","surface_form":"AU\u00A3","offset":1580}]}
