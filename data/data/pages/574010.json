{"id":574010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Cruiserweight_Championship","text":"The WWE Cruiserweight Championship is a wrestling title owned by WWE and on WWE's weekly TV show, \"205 Live\". Only wreslters under can dispute it. The first champion was T.J. Perkins and the current is Buddy Murphy.\nHistory.\nIn 2016, WWE created the Cruiserweight Classic, a 32-man tournament for cruiserweights. When T.J. Perkins beat Gran Metalik in the final, Triple H gave him the new WWE Cruiserweight Championship for the new cruiserweight division on the Raw brand.\nAfter the show \"205 Live\" was created, the Cruiserweight Championship also could be defended in this program. When WWE fired the champion at the time, Enzo Amore in January 2018, there was an announcement that there would be a general manager on \"205 Live\" and he/she would decide what would happen to the championship. Drake Maverick was chosen to be the general manager and he decided that there would be a 16-man tournament to decide a new WWE Cruiserweight Champion and that the final would happen at WrestleMania 34. In the final, Cedric Alexander beat Ali to win the title. After WrestleMania 34, \"205 Live\" separated from \"Raw\" so the title is only defended on that show.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"wrestling","offset":40},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":65},{"uri":"T.J._Perkins","surface_form":"T.J.
