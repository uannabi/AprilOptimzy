He discovered of the Faddeev equations in the theory of the quantum mechanical three-body problem and for the development of path integral methods.\nFaddeev was born in Leningrad. He studied at Saint Petersburg State University.\nFaddeev led the Leningrad School, in which he along with many of his students developed the quantum inverse scattering method for studying quantum integrable systems in one space and one time dimension. This work led to the invention of quantum groups by Drinfeld and Jimbo.\nFrom 1976 to 2000, Faddeev was head of the St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences (PDMI RAS).\nFaddeev died on 26 February 2017 in St. Petersburg, Russia at the age of 82.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"USSR","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":98},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":109},{"uri":"Theoretical_physicist","surface_form":"theoretical physicist","offset":117},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":143},{"uri":"Faddeev_equations","surface_form":"Faddeev equations","offset":179},{"uri":"Three-body_problem","surface_form":"three-body problem","offset":237},{"uri":"Path_integral_formulation","surface_form":"path integral","offset":283},{"uri":"Leningrad","surface_form":"Leningrad","offset":326},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg_State_University","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg State University","offset":351},{"uri":"Quantum_inverse_scattering_method","surface_form":"quantum inverse scattering method","offset":478},{"uri":"Quantum_integrable_systems","surface_form":"quantum integrable systems","offset":525},{"uri":"Quantum_group","surface_form":"quantum group","offset":623},{"uri":"Vladimir_Drinfeld","surface_form":"Drinfeld","offset":641},{"uri":"Michio_Jimbo","surface_form":"Jimbo","offset":654},{"uri":"St._Petersburg_Department_of_Steklov_Institute_of_Mathematics_of_Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences","offset":704},{"uri":"St._Petersburg","surface_form":"St. Petersburg","offset":845}]}
