{"id":574025,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Garvey","text":"Edward R. \"Ed\" Garvey (April 18, 1940 \u2013 February 22, 2017) was an American lawyer, politician and progressive activist.\nEarly life.\nGarvey was born in Burlington, Wisconsin. He studied at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nLegal career.\nGarvey worked for the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), the labor organization representing the professional American football players in the National Football League (NFL). In 1970 Garvey was assigned to counsel union president John Mackey regarding negotiations on a new four year contract with the league's owners.\nGarvey was later offered the position of executive director in the now-certified NFLPA in 1971.\nGarvey served as its executive director until 1983, through two strikes (in 1974 and 1982) and invoking antitrust legislation in his many court battles with the league.\nGarvey directed the NFLPA though a series of court battles that led, in 1975, to the ruling in Mackey v. NFL that antitrust laws applied to the NFL's restrictions on player movement.\nIn 1976, armed with leverage regarding player movement from team to team, Garvey and the union won major concessions from the owners. Garvey's negotiations with the league exchanged the players' threat of pursuing a system of unfettered free agency for an improved package of player benefits.\nFailed political career.\nIn 1986, Garvey ran for the U.S. Senate from Wisconsin, losing to Republican incumbent Bob Kasten by a small margin In an unsuccessful bid for Wisconsin governor in 1998 against three-term incumbent Tommy G. Thompson, Garvey sought to highlight campaign finance reform and limited contributions to his campaign to a fixed amount per donor. Thompson won by a wide margin.\nDeath.\nGarvey died on February 22, 2017 at his lake home in Verona, Wisconsin, aged 76.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Burlington%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Burlington, Wisconsin","offset":151},{"uri":"University_of_Wisconsin-Madison","surface_form":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","offset":192},{"uri":"National_Football_League_Players_Association","surface_form":"National Football League Players Association","offset":261},{"uri":"Trade_union","surface_form":"labor organization","offset":319},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"professional American football","offset":355},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":401},{"uri":"John_Mackey_(athlete)","surface_form":"John Mackey","offset":488},{"uri":"Labor_contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":542},{"uri":"Executive_director","surface_form":"executive director","offset":618},{"uri":"Strike_action","surface_form":"strike","offset":737},{"uri":"Antitrust","surface_form":"antitrust","offset":777},{"uri":"Mackey_v._NFL","surface_form":"Mackey v.
