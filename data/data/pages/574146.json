{"id":574146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans","text":"Irish Americans () are an North American ethnic group. They are American citizens whose ancestors were Irish.\nHistory.\nMost Irish people came to the United States between the 17th to mid-19th centuries.\nThe largest number of Irish people came to the United States between 1820 and 1860. During this time, one out of every three people who immigrated to the United States was Irish.\nBetween 1820 and 1860, 1,956,557 Irish arrived in the United States. 75% of these immigrants - about 1.5 million Irish people - came after the Great Famine of 1845-1852 (also called \"The Great Hunger\". Many more Irish people died while trying to travel to America on coffin ships.\nBetween 1820 and 1930, about 4.5 million Irish people moved to the United States.\nWhere they lived.\nMost Irish people who came to the United States during the 1800s lived in big cities where there were many other Irish people. They did this so they could help and protect each other. Many stayed near the ports where they arrived, like Boston, New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Many Irish people also lived in Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore.\nDiscrimination.\nMost of the Irish immigrants who came to America in the 1800s were Catholic. At that time, most of the United States was controlled by Protestants who were ethnically English, Anglo-Saxon, and Germanic.\nIn the mid-1950s, a political group called the Know-Nothing Movement tried to get Catholic politicians fired from their jobs.\nIrish Americans today.\nIn 2013, about 33.3 million Americans - about one in every 10 - reported having some Irish ancestry. This is about seven times the number of people who actually live in Ireland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_American","surface_form":"North American","offset":26},{"uri":"Ethnic_group","surface_form":"ethnic group","offset":41},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestors","offset":88},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":103},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th","offset":175},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th centuries","offset":187},{"uri":"Great_Famine","surface_form":"Great Famine","offset":525},{"uri":"Coffin_ship","surface_form":"coffin ship","offset":649},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":968},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":999},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1007},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":1022},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1041},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":1086},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":1095},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":1109},{"uri":"St._Louis","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":1118},{"uri":"Pittsburgh","surface_form":"Pittsburgh","offset":1129},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":1145},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":1239},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestants","offset":1307},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":1339},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":1348},{"uri":"Germanic_peoples","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":1365},{"uri":"Know-Nothing_Movement","surface_form":"Know-Nothing Movement","offset":1422}]}
