{"id":574147,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_iron","text":"=\"preserve\">Iron is the most often-used example of a metal with allotropes. These allotropes are \u03B1-iron, aka ferrite, \u03B3-iron, aka austenite, and \u03B4-iron, which doesn\u2019t have another name. At higher temperatures, \u03B5-iron exists, called hexaferrum. There is evidence for a fifth form, but it has not been proven to exist.\nDelta Iron is Iron below 1538\u00B0C. Austenite is created when Iron cools further, to 1394\u00B0C. Beta ferrite Iron is the term for Iron that\u2019s paramagnetic. Alpha Iron is all Iron below 912\u00B0C. Epsilon Iron is created above 10 GigaPascals and below 100\u00B0K.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"Iron","offset":12},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":53},{"uri":"Allotropy","surface_form":"allotropes","offset":64},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":346},{"uri":"Austenite","surface_form":"Austenite","offset":350},{"uri":"Beta_ferrite","surface_form":"Beta ferrite","offset":407},{"uri":"Pascal_(unit)","surface_form":"GigaPascals","offset":536},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"\u00B0K","offset":561}]}
