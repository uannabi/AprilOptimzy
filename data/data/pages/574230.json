{"id":574230,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_33","text":"e=\"preserve\">WrestleMania 33 was the thirty-third yearly WrestleMania wrestling Pay-per-view made by WWE. It will happen on April 2, 2017 and it will be performed at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. It will be the second WrestleMania to happen at the stadium and the third to happen Florida.\nAt the 2017 Royal Rumble, Randy Orton won the most important match - the Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania 33. At the Elimination Chamber on February 12, 2017, Bray Wyatt won the WWE Championship but Randy said he won't fight Bray because he supports Bray. This means he will probably fight for the WWE Universal Championship, but Goldberg is fighting for that title at Fastlane on March 5, 2017 and he's supposed to fight Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania. Besides that, after Randy said he won't fight Bray, a 10-man battle royal happened where, in the end AJ Styles and Luke Harper fought on the apron after both going over the top rope, their feet both touched the floor and the referees could not decide who won. On SmackDown on February 28, a match between AJ and Luke will happen where the winner will fight Bray at WrestleMania. Also, at WrestleMania 32, it was a surprise when Shaquille O'Neal was in a the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. Big Show was also in the match and they fought. After that WrestleMania, Shaq asked if Big Show wanted a match at this WrestleMania. After that, they have argued inside of WWE. On the final Raw before Mania, after Show defeated James Ellsworth, Shaq confronted Show and challenged him to a Contract vs Career match (that mean if Shaq beat Show, Shaq will become a full time wrestler of WWE and Show will be forced to leave WWE). Show accepted under one more condition, this will be a Airplane match(the first wrestler falls off the airplane will lose)\nMatches.\nSingles match for WWE Universal Championship\n3.
