{"id":574313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_ferrite","text":"=\"preserve\">Beta ferrite is ferrite that is paramegnetic instead of ferromagnetic, heated to a temperature of above 771\u00B0C.\n\u03B2-Fe may refer to an unproven to exist fifth allotrope of iron, only produced once in Uppsala University. Iron was compressed to 35-40 GPa then heated to 1500\u00B0K and scanned. The result was never reproduced.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ferrite","surface_form":"ferrite","offset":28},{"uri":"Paramagnetism","surface_form":"paramegnetic","offset":44},{"uri":"Ferromagnetism","surface_form":"ferromagnetic","offset":68},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":95},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":119},{"uri":"Allotropes_of_iron","surface_form":"allotrope of iron","offset":168},{"uri":"Uppsala_University","surface_form":"Uppsala University","offset":209},{"uri":"Pascal_(unit)","surface_form":"GPa","offset":258}]}
