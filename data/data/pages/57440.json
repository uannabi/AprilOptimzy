{"id":57440,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech","text":"e=\"preserve\">A figure of speech is an indirect way of communicating an idea. Many figures of speech are not meant to be understood exactly as they are said: they are not literal, factual statements. They use indirect language, and mean something different from ordinary language.\nLinguists call these figures of speech \"tropes\"\u2014a play on words, using words in a way that is different from its accepted literal or normal form. DiYanni wrote: \"Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different \"figures of speech\", expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense\".\nMetaphors are very common examples. A common figure of speech is to say that someone \"threw down the gauntlet\". This does not mean that a person threw a protective wrist-covering down on the ground. Instead, it usually means that the person issued a public challenge to another person (or many persons).\nThere is no one easy way to distinguish plain speech from figures of speech.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statement","surface_form":"statement","offset":187},{"uri":"Trope","surface_form":"trope","offset":320},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"Metaphor","offset":575},{"uri":"Gauntlet","surface_form":"gauntlet","offset":676}]}
