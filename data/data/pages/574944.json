It is a combination of Zionism and Judaism.\nReligious Zionists are in favour of a State of Israel, that is mainly populated by Jews and dominated by Judaism.\nIn their view the State of Israel should encompass the entire Land of Israel (\"Eretz Yisrael\"). This includes the so-called Palestinian territories (West Bank, Gaza Strip) and also the Golan Heights.\nReligious Zionism dominates Modern Orthodox Judaism in Israel.\nPolitically Religious Zionists can especially be found in HaBayit HaYehudi (The Jewish Home) but also in HaLikud.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Zionism","surface_form":"Zionism","offset":86},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":130},{"uri":"State_of_Israel","surface_form":"State of Israel","offset":177},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":222},{"uri":"Land_of_Israel","surface_form":"Land of Israel","offset":315},{"uri":"Palestinian_territories","surface_form":"Palestinian territories","offset":377},{"uri":"West_Bank","surface_form":"West Bank","offset":402},{"uri":"Gaza_Strip","surface_form":"Gaza Strip","offset":413},{"uri":"Golan_Heights","surface_form":"Golan Heights","offset":438},{"uri":"Modern_Orthodox_Judaism","surface_form":"Modern Orthodox Judaism","offset":481},{"uri":"HaBayit_HaYehudi","surface_form":"HaBayit HaYehudi","offset":574},{"uri":"HaLikud","surface_form":"HaLikud","offset":621}]}
