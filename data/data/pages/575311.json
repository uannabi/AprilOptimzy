Pirenne is considered as one of the most important historians of Belgium.\nBiography.\nHe studied at the University of Li\u00E8ge and was a professor at the University of Ghent. His focus was on Medieval history, the history of Belgium and economic history.\nHe developed the so-called \"Pirenne thesis\" (nowadays out of date) in his book \"Mohammed and Charlemagne\" (published after his death in 1937). According to this opinion Mediterranean economics were disturbed by the early Islamic conquests and not by the barbarian invasions some centuries before.\nPirenne resisted the Dutchification of the University of Ghent. When this university had completely become Dutch-language spoken in 1930, he moved to the Brussels region where died in 1935, aged 72.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1862","surface_form":"1862","offset":28},{"uri":"Verviers","surface_form":"Verviers","offset":36},{"uri":"1935","surface_form":"1935","offset":59},{"uri":"Uccle","surface_form":"Uccle","offset":67},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":80},{"uri":"University_of_Li%C3%A8ge","surface_form":"University of Li\u00E8ge","offset":215},{"uri":"University_of_Ghent","surface_form":"University of Ghent","offset":262},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Medieval history","offset":300},{"uri":"History_of_Belgium","surface_form":"history of Belgium","offset":322},{"uri":"Economic_history","surface_form":"economic history","offset":345},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":532},{"uri":"Muslim_conquests","surface_form":"Islamic conquests","offset":584},{"uri":"Migration_period","surface_form":"barbarian invasions","offset":617},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutchification","offset":681},{"uri":"Brussels-Capital_Region","surface_form":"Brussels region","offset":814}]}
