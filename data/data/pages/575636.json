{"id":575636,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_towel","text":"e=\"preserve\">Paper towels (or kitchen paper) is an absorbent tissue made from paper instead of cloth. Unlike cloth towels, paper towels are disposable and thrown away after use. They soak up water because they are loosely woven. This lets water travel into the paper by capillary action. The water sticks to the fibers by adhesion.\nIn 2020, scientists from the University of Leeds performed an experiment that showed that people who dried their hands with paper towels removed more viruses than people who dried their hands with jet air dryers. The study was performed in a hospital bathroom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":78},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":95},{"uri":"Woven","surface_form":"woven","offset":222},{"uri":"Capillary_action","surface_form":"capillary action","offset":270},{"uri":"Adhesion","surface_form":"adhesion","offset":322},{"uri":"University_of_Leeds","surface_form":"University of Leeds","offset":361},{"uri":"Viruses","surface_form":"viruses","offset":482}]}
