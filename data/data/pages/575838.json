{"id":575838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunn_index","text":"=\"preserve\">The Dunn Index (DI) is a metric for judging a clustering algorithm. A higher DI implies better clustering. It assumes that better clustering means that clusters are compact and well-separated from other clusters.\nThere are many ways to define the size of a cluster and distance between clusters.\nThe DI is equal to the minimum inter-cluster distance divided by the maximum cluster size. Note that larger inter-cluster distances (better separation) and smaller cluster sizes (more compact clusters) lead to a higher DI value.\nLet the size of cluster C be denoted by: formula_1\nLet the distance between clusters i and j be denoted by: formula_1\nformula_1","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cluster_analysis","surface_form":"clustering","offset":58},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":69}]}
