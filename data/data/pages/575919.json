{"id":575919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_bulb","text":"The olfactory bulb is a part of the vertebrate forebrain. It works in olfaction, or the sense of smell.\nThe olfactory bulb has one source of sensory input (axons from olfactory receptor neurons, and one output (mitral cell axons). It is thought that it functions as a filter. However, the olfactory bulb also gets \"top-down\" information from brain areas like the amygdala, neocortex, hippocampus, locus coeruleus, and substantia nigra.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":36},{"uri":"Forebrain","surface_form":"forebrain","offset":47},{"uri":"Olfaction","surface_form":"olfaction","offset":70},{"uri":"Axon","surface_form":"axon","offset":156},{"uri":"Filter","surface_form":"filter","offset":268},{"uri":"Amygdala","surface_form":"amygdala","offset":363},{"uri":"Neocortex","surface_form":"neocortex","offset":373},{"uri":"Hippocampus","surface_form":"hippocampus","offset":384},{"uri":"Locus_coeruleus","surface_form":"locus coeruleus","offset":397},{"uri":"Substantia_nigra","surface_form":"substantia nigra","offset":418}]}
