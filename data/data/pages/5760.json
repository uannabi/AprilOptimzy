{"id":5760,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor","text":"A microprocessor is an electronic component that is used by a computer to do its work. It is a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit chip containing millions of very small components including transistors, resistors, and diodes that work together. Some microprocessors in the 20th century required several chips. Microprocessors help to do everything from controlling elevators to searching the Web. Everything a computer does is described by instructions of computer programs, and microprocessors carry out these instructions many millions of times a second.\nMicroprocessors were invented in the 1970s for use in embedded systems. The majority are still used that way, in such things as mobile phones, cars, military weapons, and home appliances. Some microprocessors are microcontrollers, so small and inexpensive that they are used to control very simple products like flashlights and greeting cards that play music when opened. A few especially powerful microprocessors are used in personal computers.\nMicroprocessor operation.\nLike other central processing units, microprocessors use three steps commonly called Fetch, Decode, and Execute. In the Fetch step, an instruction is copied from the computer memory into the microprocessor. In the Decode step, the microprocessor figures out what operation the instruction is meant to do. In the Execute step, this operation is performed. Different computers can have different instruction set<nowiki/>s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronic_component","surface_form":"electronic component","offset":23},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":62},{"uri":"Central_processing_unit","surface_form":"central processing unit","offset":95},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":131},{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":210},{"uri":"Resistor","surface_form":"resistor","offset":223},{"uri":"Diode","surface_form":"diode","offset":238},{"uri":"Elevator","surface_form":"elevator","offset":385},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Web","offset":412},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":476},{"uri":"Embedded_system","surface_form":"embedded system","offset":631},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":705},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":720},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":735},{"uri":"Home_appliance","surface_form":"home appliance","offset":748},{"uri":"Microcontroller","surface_form":"microcontroller","offset":790},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"personal computer","offset":1003},{"uri":"Central_processing_unit","surface_form":"central processing unit","offset":1060},{"uri":"Execution_unit","surface_form":"Execute","offset":1153},{"uri":"Instruction_(computer_science)","surface_form":"instruction","offset":1184},{"uri":"Computer_memory","surface_form":"computer memory","offset":1215},{"uri":"Instruction_set","surface_form":"instruction set","offset":1443}]}
