{"id":57608,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing","text":"Skiing is either sportive or recreational activity using \"skis\" for sliding over snow. Skis are used with special boots connected to them with a \"binding\". There are two different types of skiing: downhill skiing and cross country skiing.\nDownhill skiing.\nDownhill skiing is a sport. Skiers ski down a trail (also called a \"run\") on the side of a mountain or hill. Each trail is marked with a sign that shows how difficult that particular run will be. Three different colors are used to rate the difficulty of the trail. They are: green, blue, and black. Green trails are easiest, blue trails are more difficult, and black trails are rated most difficult. The colors which represent a trail will also be seen in a shape.\nTrail ratings are often relative to the rest of the terrain at the ski resort- for example, the difficulty of a black diamond trail at a small ski area may be a rated as a blue square at a bigger resort with harder trails.\nCross country skiing.\nCross country skiing is a sport of endurance. Skiers ski anywhere where there is snow. This is usually through a scenic forest or town.\nAlpine skiing.\nAlpine skiing is a contest of speed. Racers go through the course with red and blue gates and go down to the goal as fast as they can. There are four disciplines in alpine skiing: downhill, super giant slalom, giant slalom and slalom.\nSki gate.\nA ski gate is two sticks on a skiing race course that a skier needs to pass between. Ski gates are used in alpine skiing in downhill, Slalom, Giant Slalom and Super-G races. Downhill races have not many ski gates so skiers can be safe when they are going very fast. If a skier does not go between a ski gate, the judges say are removed from the race. First in the 1980s and now a lot of the time, ski gates have hinges near the snow. Some ski gates have flags at the top of the stick.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":17},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":29},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":81},{"uri":"Boot","surface_form":"boot","offset":114},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":347},{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":359},{"uri":"Trail","surface_form":"trail","offset":514},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":714},{"uri":"Ski_resort","surface_form":"ski resort","offset":788},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":1086},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":1096},{"uri":"Alpine_skiing","surface_form":"Alpine skiing","offset":1117},{"uri":"Slalom_skiing","surface_form":"slalom","offset":1344},{"uri":"Hinge","surface_form":"hinge","offset":1774},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":1816}]}
