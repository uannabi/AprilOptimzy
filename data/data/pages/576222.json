{"id":576222,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_reduced_iron","text":"e=\"preserve\">Direct reduced iron is created when iron ore is burned in a bloomery. Direct reduced iron is also called sponge iron. Direct reduction is removing the oxygen from the ore. Gas and Coal are both used to burn iron. Using Direct Reduction to costs less than using blast furnaces. Direct Reduction is used more than blast furnaces. The country that makes the most Direct reduced iron is India.\nProblems.\nDirect reduced iron gets rust very easily. Direct reduced iron can light on fire easily. Direct reduced iron contains waste, which has to be removed before it can be turned into steel. Only a small amount of Direct reduced iron can be made at a time.\nHistory.\nAncient Egyptians used direct reduced iron because it was easier to work with. Direct reduced iron can be made at a lower temperature.\nUses.\nDirect reduced iron is not useful on its own. Before it is used, Direct reduced iron is beaten with hammers and folded many times to make Wrought Iron. The Wrought Iron is burned to make steel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iron_ore","surface_form":"iron ore","offset":49},{"uri":"Bloomery","surface_form":"bloomery","offset":73},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":164},{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"Gas","offset":185},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"Coal","offset":193},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":220},{"uri":"Blast_furnace","surface_form":"blast furnaces","offset":274},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":396},{"uri":"Rust","surface_form":"rust","offset":438},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":591},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egyptians","offset":673},{"uri":"Wrought_iron","surface_form":"Wrought Iron","offset":952}]}
