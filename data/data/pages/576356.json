Scott's musical style has been described as a fusion of traditional hip hop, lo-fi and ambient.\nIn 2012, Scott signed his first major-label deal with Epic Records. In November of the same year, Scott signed a deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music, as part of its production wing Very GOOD Beats. In April 2013, Scott signed a record deal with T.I.'s Grand Hustle imprint. Scott's first full-length project, the mixtape \"Owl Pharaoh\", was self-released in 2013. It was followed with a second mixtape, \"Days Before Rodeo\", in August 2014. His debut studio album, \"Rodeo\" (2015), was led by the hit single \"Antidote\". His second album, \"Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight\" (2016) became his first number one album on the \"Billboard\" 200. The following year, Scott released a collaborative album with Quavo titled \"Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho\" under the group name Huncho Jack.\nIn 2018, his highly anticipated \"Astroworld\" was released to widespread critical acclaim and produced his first \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one single, \"Sicko Mode\". In late 2019, Scott's record label Cactus Jack Records released the compilation album \"JackBoys\" which became the first number one album on the \"Billboard\" 200 of the 2020s. As of 2020, Scott has sold over 45 million certified records in the US alone. He has been nominated for six Grammy Awards and won a \"Billboard\" Music Award.\nThe Travis Scott meal helped boost McDonald's sales in September 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Missouri_City%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Missouri City, Texas","offset":191},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":281},{"uri":"Lo-fi_music","surface_form":"lo-fi","offset":290},{"uri":"Ambient_music","surface_form":"ambient","offset":300},{"uri":"Major_record_label","surface_form":"major-label","offset":341},{"uri":"Epic_Records","surface_form":"Epic Records","offset":363},{"uri":"Kanye_West","surface_form":"Kanye West","offset":432},{"uri":"GOOD_Music","surface_form":"GOOD Music","offset":445},{"uri":"Very_GOOD_Beats","surface_form":"Very GOOD Beats","offset":488},{"uri":"Record_deal","surface_form":"record deal","offset":535},{"uri":"T.I.","surface_form":"T.I.","offset":552},{"uri":"Grand_Hustle_Records","surface_form":"Grand Hustle","offset":559},{"uri":"Mixtape","surface_form":"mixtape","offset":620},{"uri":"Owl_Pharaoh","surface_form":"Owl Pharaoh","offset":629},{"uri":"Self-released","surface_form":"self-released","offset":647},{"uri":"Days_Before_Rodeo","surface_form":"Days Before Rodeo","offset":710},{"uri":"Rodeo_(Travis_Scott_album)","surface_form":"Rodeo","offset":771},{"uri":"Antidote_(Travis_Scott_song)","surface_form":"Antidote","offset":813},{"uri":"Birds_in_the_Trap_Sing_McKnight","surface_form":"Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight","offset":843},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":924},{"uri":"Quavo","surface_form":"Quavo","offset":1003},{"uri":"Huncho_Jack%2C_Jack_Huncho","surface_form":"Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho","offset":1017},{"uri":"Huncho_Jack","surface_form":"Huncho Jack","offset":1064},{"uri":"Astroworld_(album)","surface_form":"Astroworld","offset":1110},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":1189},{"uri":"Sicko_Mode","surface_form":"Sicko Mode","offset":1229},{"uri":"Cactus_Jack_Records","surface_form":"Cactus Jack Records","offset":1277},{"uri":"Compilation_album","surface_form":"compilation album","offset":1310},{"uri":"JackBoys","surface_form":"JackBoys","offset":1329},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":1524},{"uri":"Billboard_Music_Award","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Music Award","offset":1548},{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":1608}]}
