{"id":576466,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_virginiana","text":"Chokecherries (\"Prunus virginiana\"), also known as the bitter-berry, Virginia bird cherry, and western chokecherry, are shrubs or small trees, which grow to around 4.9 m (16 ft 1 in).\nTheir leaves are oval with coarse, sharp edges. The flowers grow about 38.1\u201376.2 cm (15\u201330 in) long in late spring (well after chokecherry leaves appear).\nThe fruits are about 1 cm (3\u20448 in) across. They range in color from bright red to black. They have a very astringent taste, both somewhat sour and somewhat bitter. The fruits are sweetest when they are very ripe \"berries\" (actually drupes). These are dark in color.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prunus","surface_form":"Prunus","offset":16},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrubs","offset":120},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":190},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruits","offset":343},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"across","offset":374},{"uri":"Sour","surface_form":"sour","offset":477},{"uri":"Bitterness","surface_form":"bitter","offset":495}]}
