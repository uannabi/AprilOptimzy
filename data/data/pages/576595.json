Its ideology is left-wing centrist, and Zionist.\nHaMa\u1E25aneh HaTziyoni was formed in 2014 as a cooperation of HaAvoda (Israeli Labor Party), HaTnu'a (\"The Movement\"), and HaTnu'a HaYeruqa (\"The Green Movement\") in an effort to prevent Likud continuing its governing position after the Knesset elections of 2015.\nBecause its attempt was unsuccessful, party head Yitzhak Herzog became leader of the opposition. When Herzog left the Knesset in June 2018 to become head of the Jewish Agency for Israel, he was replaced by Tzipi Livni.\nThere are two political leaders. The party head is Avi Gabbay (HaAvoda). As Gabbay is not a Knesset member, Tzipi Livni (HaTnu'a) leads this faction in the Knesset.\nNumber of seats in the 20th Knesset: 24 (HaAvoda: 19, HaTnu'a: 4, HaTnu'a HaYeruqa 1).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":114},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":161},{"uri":"Centrist","surface_form":"centrist","offset":171},{"uri":"Zionist","surface_form":"Zionist","offset":185},{"uri":"2014","surface_form":"2014","offset":228},{"uri":"HaAvoda","surface_form":"HaAvoda","offset":253},{"uri":"HaTnu%27a","surface_form":"HaTnu'a","offset":284},{"uri":"HaTnu%27a_HaYeruqa","surface_form":"HaTnu'a HaYeruqa","offset":314},{"uri":"Likud","surface_form":"Likud","offset":378},{"uri":"Yitzhak_Herzog","surface_form":"Yitzhak Herzog","offset":504},{"uri":"Tzipi_Livni","surface_form":"Tzipi Livni","offset":661},{"uri":"Avi_Gabbay","surface_form":"Avi Gabbay","offset":725},{"uri":"Knesset","surface_form":"Knesset","offset":867}]}
