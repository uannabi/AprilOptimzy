As an early proponent of boltless, pitonless clean climbing, he, along with Yvon Chouinard, was instrumental in changing the climbing culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s by encouraging the use and preservation of the natural features of the rock.\nHe went on to become a well-known kayaker.\nRobbins died on March 14, 2017 in Modesto, California from a long-illness, aged 82.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_climbing","surface_form":"rock climbing","offset":86},{"uri":"Tahquitz","surface_form":"Tahquitz","offset":128},{"uri":"Big_wall_climbing","surface_form":"big wall","offset":178},{"uri":"Yosemite","surface_form":"Yosemite","offset":197},{"uri":"Clean_climbing","surface_form":"clean climbing","offset":252},{"uri":"Yvon_Chouinard","surface_form":"Yvon Chouinard","offset":283},{"uri":"Kayaking","surface_form":"kayaker","offset":494},{"uri":"Modesto%2C_California","surface_form":"Modesto, California","offset":537}]}
