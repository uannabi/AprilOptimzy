It is the first game in the \"New Super Mario Bros.\" series. A follow-up, \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" for Nintendo Wii, was released in November and December 2009 and a sequel to this game and follow-up to the Wii version, \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" was released on the Nintendo 3DS in August 2012.\nStory.\nMario and Princess Peach are out for a walk when Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach. Mario must go through eight worlds to save her.\nGameplay.\nThe game uses many old features from the older \"Mario\" games. The countdown game clock is back; if Mario does not reach the castle at the end, he will lose a life. Mario also must jump and catch onto a flagpole at the end of the level and goes into a castle, just like he did in \"Super Mario Bros.\" Before and after a level, Mario is on a world map, which was last used in \"Super Mario World\".\nMario also has new powers from the 3D games (\"Super Mario 64\" and \"Sunshine\"). He can do a ground-pound and can do a triple jump in the air. Both of these things first started in the 3D games.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":45},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":73},{"uri":"Nintendo_DS","surface_form":"Nintendo DS","offset":90},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":230},{"uri":"May","surface_form":"May","offset":247},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":255},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":293},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":319},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":332},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":353},{"uri":"New_Super_Mario_Bros._Wii","surface_form":"New Super Mario Bros.
