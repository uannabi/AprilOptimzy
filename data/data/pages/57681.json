Her husband, as well as being a great cellist and conductor, was also an excellent pianist and he accompanied her for her recitals. They were very close friends of Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten and performed a lot of their works. She made many recordings including the main part in Shostakovich's opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District and in Britten's \"War Requiem\". She had not been allowed to take part in the first performance of the \"War Requiem\" because the Soviet politicians would not let her sing together with the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau because he was German.\nIn 1974, they left the Soviet Union because they had criticized the Soviet government. They settled in the United States and Paris. In 1982 she retired from singing in opera.
