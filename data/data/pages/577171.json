In March 2016, Barack Obama became the first U.S. President to visit Cuba since 1928.\nBackground.\nOn December 17, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00FAl Castro announced the beginning of a process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States. The normalization agreement was secretly negotiated in the months before, being overseen by Pope Francis and largely hosted by the Government of Canada.\nMeetings were held in Canada and in Vatican City. The agreement would see the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, and U.S. banks' access to the Cuban financial system.\nEffects.\nOn April 14, 2015, the Obama administration announced that Cuba would be removed from the United States State Sponsors of Terrorism list. With no congressional action to block this within the permitted time period, Cuba was officially removed from the list on May 29, 2015. This marked a further departure by the United States from the Cold War conflict and its strain on Cuba\u2013United States relations.\nOn July 20, 2015, the Cuban and U.S. \"interests sections\" in Washington and Havana were upgraded to embassies, marking the re-establishment of diplomatic relations that had been broken in 1961..\nTrump presidency.\nOn June 16, 2017 President Donald Trump announced that he was \"canceling\" the Obama administrations deals with Cuba, while also expressing that a new deal could be negotiated between the Cuban and United States governments.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cuba%E2%80%93United_States_relations","surface_form":"Cuba\u2013United States relations","offset":48},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":165},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":285},{"uri":"Ra%C3%BAl_Castro","surface_form":"Ra\u00FAl Castro","offset":318},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":400},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":413},{"uri":"Pope_Francis","surface_form":"Pope Francis","offset":520},{"uri":"Government_of_Canada","surface_form":"Government","offset":559},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":573},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":603},{"uri":"Vatican_City","surface_form":"Vatican City","offset":617},{"uri":"Remittance","surface_form":"remittance","offset":723},{"uri":"State_Sponsors_of_Terrorism","surface_form":"State Sponsors of Terrorism","offset":903},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":1135},{"uri":"United_States_Interests_Section_in_Havana","surface_form":"interests sections","offset":1239},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":1441}]}
