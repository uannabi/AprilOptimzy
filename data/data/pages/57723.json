{"id":57723,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier","text":"Israel-West-Bank barrier is a wall built by the State of Israel to separate Palestinian territories from Israel. It is built mostly of fences and in some places it is built of high concrete walls. It is 708 kilometers (439 miles) long.\nThe barrier was built in the Second Intifada that began in September 2000, when the Israeli government argued that it necessary to stop the violence and suicide bombing attacks coming from the West Bank.\nThere are many arguments about the barrier. People who want the barrier say it is needed to protect Israeli civilians from Palestinian terrorism. Since the barrier was built, the number of attacks has gone down, especially in areas where the barrier has been fully completed. Israel has stated that it is necessary for the country's security.\nPeople who are against the barrier say that it is against international law because Israel and the Palestinians have not agreed where the border between them should be and have not reached a consensus. While the Palestinian Authority is in charge for water sources, the economic system, etc. in the West Bank, Palestinians who tavel to Israel for medical, educational or work purposes have said that the barrier has negative effects on daily life and gives them less freedom (due to checkpoints).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wall","surface_form":"wall","offset":30},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"State of Israel","offset":48},{"uri":"Palestinian_territories","surface_form":"Palestinian territories","offset":76},{"uri":"Fence","surface_form":"fence","offset":135},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":181},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":305},{"uri":"West_Bank","surface_form":"West Bank","offset":429},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":841},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":921},{"uri":"Consensus","surface_form":"consensus","offset":974}]}
