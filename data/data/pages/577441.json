{"id":577441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument","text":"e=\"preserve\">The ontological argument is an idea in religious philosophy. It is supposed to show that God exists.\nThere are different versions, but they all argue something like: because we can imagine a perfect being, there must be a god. The idea is that existing makes a good thing better than one that's only imaginary. So the perfect thing we're imagining must exist. Then we call the perfect thing God. The earliest objection was that an argument like that could prove wrong things. You could prove that a perfect island must exist, for example. But no real island is perfect.\nBecause it starts with imagination, not what you can see or experience, this is a kind of \"a priori\" reasoning. David Hume didn't like that way of thinking. He believed that knowledge had to come from experience and called everything else \"nothing but sophistry and illusion\".\nOther versions of the argument start with the idea of the universe, and from that argue that there must be a god.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ontological_argument","surface_form":"ontological argument","offset":17},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":62},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":102},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":235},{"uri":"David_Hume","surface_form":"David Hume","offset":695},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":918}]}
