{"id":57746,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfir_wal-Hijra","text":"e=\"preserve\">Takfir wal-Hijra (- \"Excommunication and Exodus\") is a violent radical Islamist extremist group. The group that was founded in Egypt in the 1960s. Today Takfir wal-Hijra has members or supporters in several other countries, allied to Al-Qaeda. In Spain the group is also known as \"Martyrs for Morocco\".\nMembers of the group are radical Islamists. It looks like the members of the group are not bound by the usual Islamic religious constraints. They adopt non-Islamic appearances. They might shave their beard or wear a tie. They do this to be hard to detect in crowds. Sometimes, even other Muslims have problems detecting them. They can drink alcohol and even eat pork to deceive their enemies. They believe that any means justify the end and, that killing other Muslims can be justified in their cause and that Western society is heathen and it is their duty to destroy it.\nLittle is known about the current organization or hierarchy of the group. Several groups which adhere to the same ideology have possibly used the name independently of each other.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Islamist","surface_form":"Islamist","offset":84},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":140},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda","surface_form":"Al-Qaeda","offset":247},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":260},{"uri":"Heathen","surface_form":"heathen","offset":845}]}
