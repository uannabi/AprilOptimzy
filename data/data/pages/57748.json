{"id":57748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27at","text":"In Egyptian mythology, Ma'at, pronounced as 'Muh-aht', is goddess of law, morality, and justice. Ma'at was supposed the stars, seasons, and the actions of both people and gods. Her first role in Egyptian mythology was the weighing of words that took place in the underworld, Duat.\nPurpose.\nMa\u2019at's purpose was to keep truth, balance, order, harmony, righteousness, morality, and justice. Ma\u2019at weighed the heart of the deceased against her feather of truth on a scale during the journey to the afterlife. She placed the dead man's heart on the other side while her husband Thoth wrote down the results of the scale to see if that person was good or bad and if they would have a happy afterlife or be eaten by the devourer. Without Ma\u2019at, the universe would become chaos once again. If the dead person\u2019s heart was heavier than the feather, then it had done evil deeds like lying when it was alive. When that happened, the heart was devoured by a monster and was not able to go to the afterlife. If it was lighter than the feather, then it was allowed to go onto the afterlife.\nPhysical Description.\nMa\u2019at had dark skin and hair. She was usually shown wearing a white linen dress. She, like Isis, was a winged goddess and she wore lots of armbands and necklaces made from gold and jewels. Her feather of truth was strapped to her head. Like the other gods and goddesses, she wore the black eye makeup around her eyes and on her eyebrows which is known as \"kohl\", which showed her high ranking status.\nLaw.\nThe chief judge in charge of the Egyptian law courts was known as \u201CThe priest of Ma\u2019at.\u201D He began court hearings wearing the feather of Ma\u2019at. The person that won his case got to have the feather of Ma\u2019at. The guilty party had violated Ma\u2019at, and it was assumed that he or she would suffer failure, poverty, sickness, blindness and deafness, with the final judgment waiting in the court of the dead. Tomb robbery was considered one of the most heinous crimes, and might involve 100 strokes of a cane, five bleeding cuts added or brands as a sign of permanent dishonor. Often, the entire family of the guilty suffered as well. For example; when individuals were sentenced into exile, their children were automatically outlawed with them. Ma\u2019at represented truth, order, balance and justice in the universe. This concept said that everyone, not including slaves, should be viewed as equals under the law. The king made sure that was carried out, and he/she would decide the case and the proper justice, maybe asking his viziers who often acted as judges. Even the lowliest fisherman was allowed to bring a legal case to the viziers.\nPower and Magic.\nAll goddesses including Ma'at had power over the Egyptians, and different powers over the other gods. One of the powers Ma'at gave the gods was the ability to breath air. Like the water of life, Ma'at's potion brought an afterlife after death to the peaceful and law-abiding people, but death to violent and cruel people. Ma'at was very powerful, but she still had limits to her powers. She could not make the sun travel through the sky like Ra could, she could not control the netherworld like Osiris could, and she could not make the stars shine like Nut could but she still had her own unique powers like her potion.\nWorship.\nThe Pharaohs prime task in governing was to uphold Ma\u2019at and they often held seated images of Ma\u2019at in their hand to the gods, which indicated that the Pharaoh represented the divine order. The words \u201CI have done Ma\u2019at\", were spoken by several Pharaohs and several others called themselves, \u201CBeloved of Ma\u2019at.\u201D Even the gods were sometimes shown praising Ma\u2019at. People were interested in how they could please her but they also were afraid of her. It was said that a small image of Ma\u2019at was more pleasing to the gods than piles of rich offerings. It was also said that a little truth was more welcome than huge bribes.\nTemples.\nThere was only one temple for Ma'at in Karnak but she was still worshiped in all Egyptian temples. In every Egyptian temple one area was called the hall of two truths or the hall of Ma'at. In the hall of two truths Ma'at weighed a man's heart against the feather of truth to see if the man would have an afterlife or his heart would be eaten by, the devourer.\nMa'at as a principle.\nMa'at as a principle was at least partially codified into a set of laws, and expressed a ubiquitous concept of right from wrong characterized by concepts of truth and a respect for and adherence to a divine order believed to be set forth at the time of the world's creation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"Egyptian mythology","offset":3},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"goddess","offset":58},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":69},{"uri":"Morals","surface_form":"morality","offset":74},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":88},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":120},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":127},{"uri":"Duat","surface_form":"Duat","offset":275},{"uri":"Thoth","surface_form":"Thoth","offset":573},{"uri":"Kohl","surface_form":"kohl","offset":1454},{"uri":"Ra","surface_form":"Ra","offset":3094},{"uri":"Osiris","surface_form":"Osiris","offset":3147},{"uri":"Nut_(goddess)","surface_form":"Nut","offset":3205},{"uri":"Laws","surface_form":"laws","offset":4359}]}
