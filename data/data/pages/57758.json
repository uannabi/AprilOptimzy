{"id":57758,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate","text":"A Mediterranean climate is a climate that has dry summers that are hot or warm as well as winters that are cool or mild with moderate or high rainfall. It includes the climate of much of the land near the Mediterranean Sea. Outside the Mediterranean, one can find this climate only in rather small areas. It is found in many places that are roughly between latitudes 30\u00B0 to 45\u00B0 north and south of the equator.\nIn the K\u00F6ppen climate classification, it is split between hot-summer Mediterranean (\"Csa\"), warm-summer Mediterranean (\"Csb\") and cool-summer Mediterranean (\"Csc\"). Examples of \"Csa\" are Rome, Lisbon and Adelaide. Examples of \"Csb\" are Porto, Cape Town and San Francisco. \"Csc\" only occurs at very high altitude.\nLocation.\nBesides the Mediterranean Basin, regions which have a Mediterranean climate include the coastal areas of the Western United States, down to Los Angeles, the Western Cape in South Africa, central Chile, southern Western Australia and the coastal areas of South Australia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":29},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":205},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":357},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":401},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":417},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":597},{"uri":"Lisbon","surface_form":"Lisbon","offset":603},{"uri":"Adelaide","surface_form":"Adelaide","offset":614},{"uri":"Porto","surface_form":"Porto","offset":646},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":653},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":667},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":745},{"uri":"Western_United_States","surface_form":"Western United States","offset":842},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":873},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":906},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":928},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":952},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":987}]}
