She discovered dark matter\nEarly life.\nRubin was born on July 23, 1928. Her parents were Rose Applebaum and Phillip Cooper. \u00A0At age 10, Rubin became fascinated by the stars in her home, Washington, D.C. At age 14, she built her first telescope.\nWork.\nRubin attended Vassar College where she earned her B.A.\u00A0in 1948. She earned her M.A. at Cornell University in 1951. She received her Ph.D. in astronomy at Georgetown University. At Cornell her thesis studied evidence of bulk rotation in the universe.\nRubin taught at Georgetown before becoming a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Science. She spent a year as a teacher in math and physics at Montgomery County Junior College. She contributed to newspapers. She was an associated editor of the Astronomical Journal and the editorial board of Science Magazine. Rubin was on the astronomical committee at Harvard University and at the National Academy of Sciences.\nRubin was an American astronomer who discovered dark matter. Dark matter is a material in the universe that does not reflect light. She and W. Kent Ford found that the stars closest to the center of the galaxy and the stars farthest from the center of the galaxy moved at the same rate. \u00A0Their findings said that mass astronomers could see only 10 percent of the galaxy's total mass. This makes dark matter invisible. Rubin joined the council of American Women in Science in 1984 to promote women in astronomy.\nRubin was given honorary degrees from Creighton University, Harvard University, and Yale University. She won the National Medal of Sciences in 1993.\nLater years.\nRubin was married to Robert Rubin, a physicist. She wrote a children's book on astronomy to encourage young girls to study science. Rubin had four children named David, Allan, Judith, and Carl. Her children all became scientists.\nRubin died in Princeton on December 25, 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":59},{"uri":"Dark_matter","surface_form":"dark matter","offset":95},{"uri":"Telescope","surface_form":"telescope","offset":314},{"uri":"Cornell_University","surface_form":"Cornell University","offset":419},{"uri":"Georgetown_University","surface_form":"Georgetown University","offset":486},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":941},{"uri":"National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":971},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":1023},{"uri":"Dark_matter","surface_form":"dark matter","offset":1049},{"uri":"Dark_matter","surface_form":"Dark matter","offset":1062},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":1501},{"uri":"Creighton_University","surface_form":"Creighton University","offset":1550},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":1572},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":1596},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":1711}]}
