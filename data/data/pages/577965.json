She lived around 370 - 415 C.E. Hypatia was the first noted women in mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy. She lead a philosophical movement called Neoplatonism. Neoplatonism was developed from the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato.\nHypatia was born in Alexandria, a city in Egypt. During Hypatia\u2019s time, Egypt was a great place for learning. Her dad was also a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, so she had it in her blood line. Her father was Theon. Hypatia and her father worked on commentaries of Ptolemy\u2019s work together. Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer who was from Alexandria. Hypatia's name was also put on work done by other mathematicians.\nThe Museum of Alexandria was a more like a university and library than a museum. It played a big role in education, and Hypatia\u2019s life. Theon may have been the director of the museum at one point. Theon was interested in mathematics. This may have led Hypatia to pursue astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.\nHer skills were so notable, that she became the leader of the Neoplatonism movement in Alexandria around 400. Her reputation led students from all around the world to come visit here. She was recognized as a better philosopher than most of the men during her time. Hypatia gave lectures at her house and in lecture halls. She lectured on astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and religious literature. She wrote a number of books about mathematics.\nSynesius of Cyrene was a student of Hypatia. His letters provided some of the most important information on her life and her teachings. She taught Synesius about the building of an astrolabe.\nHypatia was never married because she said she was \u201Cwedded to the truth\u201D. She was an acquaintance of Orestes. He was the pagan governor of Alexandria. Radical monks murdered her. They possibly murdered her because the pagans seemed to have caused enmity among this Christian town. They persecuted her, and scattered her body parts around the city. She died at 45 years old, in 415 C.E.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":73},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":508},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":1516}]}
