In some countries, for example the United States of America, Tuesday is the third day of the week. In other parts of the world, Tuesday is the second day of the week.\nHistory of the name.\nThe name \"Tuesday\" comes from a Middle English word, \"Tiwesday\". This word came from the Old English word \"Tiwes d\u00E6g\". This was named after the Nordic god Tyr. Tyr was the God of War, like the Roman war god Mars, and Greek god Ares.\nIn Latin, \"Tuesday\" is called \"Martis dies\" which means \"Mars's Day\". In French, Spanish, Italian and Romanian, the (Romance languages), the word for \"Tuesday\" is nearly the same as the Latin name. Tuesday is \"mardi\" in French, \"martes\" in Spanish, \"marted\u00EC\" in Italian, \"dimarts\" in Catalan, and \"mar\u0163i\" in Romanian.\nThe Celtic languages still spoken use the Latin names, even though none of these languages came from Latin. Tuesday is \"d\u00E9 m\u00E1irt\" in Irish, \"Meurzh\" in Breton, \"dydd Mawrth\" in Welsh and \"Dim\u00E0irt\" in Scottish Gaelic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monday","surface_form":"Monday","offset":39},{"uri":"Wednesday","surface_form":"Wednesday","offset":50},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":96},{"uri":"Week","surface_form":"week","offset":154},{"uri":"Middle_English","surface_form":"Middle English","offset":281},{"uri":"Old_English_language","surface_form":"Old English","offset":338},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Nordic","offset":393},{"uri":"List_of_Norse_gods_and_goddesses","surface_form":"Tyr","offset":404},{"uri":"Mars_(mythology)","surface_form":"Mars","offset":456},{"uri":"Ares","surface_form":"Ares","offset":476},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":485},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance languages","offset":599},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":702},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":722},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":744},{"uri":"Catalan_language","surface_form":"Catalan","offset":766},{"uri":"Romanian_language","surface_form":"Romanian","offset":790},{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":933},{"uri":"Breton_language","surface_form":"Breton","offset":952},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":977},{"uri":"Scottish_Gaelic","surface_form":"Scottish Gaelic","offset":1000}]}
