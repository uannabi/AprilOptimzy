{"id":578034,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukkarahalli_lake","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kukkarahalli lake is located in the heart of the Mysore city. Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, (1794\u20131868) of the Mysore Dynasty (Kingdom of Mysore) was responsible for getting the lake created, in the year 1864, to provide water for irrigation to about 4000 ha (10,000 acres) of land outside the city. The Lake also used to be a source of water supply to the city of Mysore but over the years, sewage and excessive land encroachments (mostly illegal) and blockage of water flow sources almost led to the eutrophication of the lake. The University of Mysore and the citizen forums of Mysore continue to make efforts to preserve the lake by implementing several remedial measures.\nThere is a 4.5\u00A0km walkway on the periphery of the lake with shaded stone benches for visitors to sit, relax and enjoy the scenic serenity of the lake.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mysore","surface_form":"Mysore","offset":62},{"uri":"Mummadi_Krishnaraja_Wodeyar","surface_form":"Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar","offset":75},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Mysore","surface_form":"Kingdom of Mysore","offset":139},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigation","offset":243},{"uri":"Eutrophication","surface_form":"eutrophication","offset":514}]}
