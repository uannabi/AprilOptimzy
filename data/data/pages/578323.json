{"id":578323,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrous_metal_recycling","text":"=\"preserve\">Metals containing iron are recycled, so the iron can be used again. Steel is the metal recycled the most. One way iron is recycled is by adding carbon, which can make steel.\nDescription.\nSteel containers, cans, cars, appliances, and building materials are the most recycled things in the United States. In 2008, 97% of the amount of steel used to build things was recycled. More than the amount of steel used to make cars was recycled. Most appliances are about 75% steel.\nIron is recycled because it costs less to recycle it than to mine iron and make it usable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"Metals","offset":12},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":30},{"uri":"Recycling","surface_form":"recycled","offset":39},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"Steel","offset":80},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":156},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"cars","offset":223},{"uri":"Appliance","surface_form":"appliances","offset":229},{"uri":"Building_material","surface_form":"building materials","offset":245},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":300}]}
