{"id":57864,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music)","text":"A bar or measure is used in writing music. It is a way of organizing the written music in small sections. Each bar is a small amount of time. Most music has a regular beat (or pulse) which can be felt. Each bar usually has the same number of beats in it. Music that feels like 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 will be divided into bars with four beats worth of music in each bar.\nThe bar line (or barline) is a vertical line written in the music which separates the bars.\nAt the beginning of a piece of music there will be a time signature. The top number shows how many beats there are in each bar. The time signature tells you how long each measure is.\nA double bar does not mean \"two bars\". It is two single bar lines drawn close together. These are simply ways of visually dividing the music into sections. A double bar line can be written with one being thicker than the other. This double bar line shows the end of a piece of music.\nIf there are two dots on the left of the double bar line, this is a repeat sign. The player should go back to the beginning and start again. If the composer only wants the performer to repeat a section of the music, and not go back to the beginning, they can put in a \"start repeat\" sign. This is a double bar line with two dots on the right.\nThe first beat of a bar feels stronger than the others. When a conductor beats time, his hand (or baton) always goes DOWN for the first beat of the bar. This feels strong. The last beat of a bar is an \"upbeat\" because the conductor's hand always goes up.\nBarlines have been used since around 1600.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Time_signature","surface_form":"time signature","offset":508},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":1328},{"uri":"Baton","surface_form":"baton","offset":1363},{"uri":"1600","surface_form":"1600","offset":1557}]}
