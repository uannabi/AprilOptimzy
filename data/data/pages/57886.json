In the Legend of Zelda games, the player must use Link to fight against evil, especially Ganondorf. Although Link is the main character in the game, he never speaks (he does speak in the Legend of Zelda CD-I games). He is also left-handed, and has large ears, like most Hylians. He has also appeared in all 6 of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" games. Link mainly used a sword and a shield but he is able to use a large number of weapons like bombs, bow, hammer or a boomerang and the hook shot.\nReception.\nLink has been in many GameFAQs \"Character Battle\" contests and is the only character to have won more than once. In one of IGN's 2007 \"Hero Showdowns\", Link was voted the favorite over Cloud Strife. Link ranked first on GameDaily's Top 10 Smash Bros. characters list. IGN asked its readers to vote for their favorite Nintendo character in which Link came first.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Legend_of_Zelda","surface_form":"The Legend of Zelda","offset":46},{"uri":"Shirt","surface_form":"shirt","offset":206},{"uri":"Hat","surface_form":"hat","offset":237},{"uri":"Ganondorf","surface_form":"Ganondorf","offset":343},{"uri":"Hyrule","surface_form":"Hylians","offset":524},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._(series)","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.","offset":571},{"uri":"GameFAQs","surface_form":"GameFAQs","offset":774},{"uri":"IGN","surface_form":"IGN","offset":875},{"uri":"Cloud_Strife","surface_form":"Cloud Strife","offset":937},{"uri":"GameDaily","surface_form":"GameDaily","offset":972}]}
