This political movement wanted to unite the Dutch people considering the changed situation due to the German occupation. In December 1941 the Dutch Union was forbidden by the Germans.\nFrom mid 1942 to mid 1943 the German occupier imprisoned him in Kamp Sint-Michielsgestel. Afterwards he went in hiding in the south of the Netherlands till the liberation of that part of the country in 1944.\nAround the end of the war he was defense minister for a couple of months. Because of his wartime activities (prime) minister Willem Drees didn't want him to include in his cabinets.\nBecause of this he was queen's commissioner of the province of North Brabant from 1946 to 1959.\nIn 1959 he returned to national politics as prime minister of the De Quay cabinet. It consisted of the three Christian parties (Anti-Revolutionary Party, Catholic People's Party and Christian Historical Union) and the conservative liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. The cabinet lasted till 1963.\nThree years later, he became transport and water management minister and also deputy prime minister in the Zijlstra cabinet. This government lasted only a year.\nIn the meantime he was a senator (1963-1966) and also afterwards (1967-1969).\nDe Quay was a Roman Catholic. He died in 1985, aged 83.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1901","surface_form":"1901","offset":31},{"uri":"%27s-Hertogenbosch","surface_form":"'s-Hertogenbosch","offset":39},{"uri":"1985","surface_form":"1985","offset":66},{"uri":"Beers%2C_North_Brabant","surface_form":"Beers","offset":74},{"uri":"Catholic_People%27s_Party","surface_form":"Catholic People's Party","offset":111},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":158},{"uri":"Utrecht_University","surface_form":"Utrecht University","offset":172},{"uri":"Tilburg_University","surface_form":"Tilburg University","offset":214},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":258},{"uri":"Dutch_Union","surface_form":"Dutch Union","offset":332},{"uri":"Kamp_Sint-Michielsgestel","surface_form":"Kamp Sint-Michielsgestel","offset":616},{"uri":"Willem_Drees","surface_form":"Willem Drees","offset":885},{"uri":"Queen%27s_commissioner","surface_form":"queen's commissioner","offset":965},{"uri":"North_Brabant","surface_form":"North Brabant","offset":1005},{"uri":"De_Quay_cabinet","surface_form":"De Quay cabinet","offset":1104},{"uri":"Anti-Revolutionary_Party","surface_form":"Anti-Revolutionary Party","offset":1166},{"uri":"Catholic_People%27s_Party","surface_form":"Catholic People's Party","offset":1192},{"uri":"Christian_Historical_Union","surface_form":"Christian Historical Union","offset":1220},{"uri":"People%27s_Party_for_Freedom_and_Democracy","surface_form":"People's Party for Freedom and Democracy","offset":1277},{"uri":"Zijlstra_cabinet","surface_form":"Zijlstra cabinet","offset":1456},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1602}]}
