{"id":57907,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark","text":"After the world's oil crises in the 1970s, Denmark started to develop wind power. In 1988, two years after the Chernobyl disaster, the Danes passed a law forbidding the construction of nuclear power plants.\nThe Danes were pioneers in developing commercial wind power during the 1970s and today almost half of the wind turbines around the world are produced by Danish manufacturers such as Vestas.\nWind power in Denmark provided 30% of the electricity produced in Denmark in 2012, and cumulative installed capacity over recent years is shown in the Table below.\nWind turbines are popular with people in Denmark.\nSources: [http://www.gwec.net/fileadmin/documents/Publications/GWEC-Global_Wind_05_Report_low_res_01.pdf Global Wind 2005 Report, p.7] [http://www.gwec.net/fileadmin/documents/Publications/gwec-2006_final_01.pdf Global Wind 2006 Report, p.9]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":43},{"uri":"Chernobyl_disaster","surface_form":"Chernobyl disaster","offset":111},{"uri":"Wind_turbine","surface_form":"wind turbine","offset":313},{"uri":"Vestas","surface_form":"Vestas","offset":389}]}
