He was one of the protagonists in the pop-art movement. Rosenquist was a 2001 inductee into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame.\nRosenquist said the following about his involvement in the Pop Art movement: \"They [art critics] called me a Pop artist because I used recognizable imagery. The critics like to group people together. I didn't meet Andy Warhol until 1964. I did not really know Andy or Roy Lichtenstein that well. We all emerged separately.\"\nRosenquist died at his home in New York City on March 31, 2017 at the age of 83 after a long illness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pop-art","surface_form":"pop-art","offset":116},{"uri":"Florida_Artists_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Florida Artists Hall of Fame","offset":174},{"uri":"Andy_Warhol","surface_form":"Andy Warhol","offset":418},{"uri":"Roy_Lichtenstein","surface_form":"Roy Lichtenstein","offset":472},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":559}]}
