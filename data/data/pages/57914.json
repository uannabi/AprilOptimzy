{"id":57914,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_River_(Russia)","text":"The Don (\u0414\u043E\u043D) is one of the major rivers of Russia. It rises in the town of Novomoskovsk 60\u00A0km southeast from Tula, southeast of Moscow, and flows for a distance of about 1,870\u00A0km (1,162 miles) to the Sea of Azov.\nFrom its source, the river first flows southeast to Voronezh, then southwest to its mouth. The main city on the river is Rostov on Don, its main tributary, the Donets.\nHistory.\nIn antiquity, the river was seen as the border between Europe and Asia. In the Hebrew Book of Jubilees, it is mentioned as being part of the border, beginning with its westernmost point up to its mouth, between the allotment of Japheth to the north and that of Shem to the south, sons of Noah. During the times of the old Scythians it was known in Greek as the Tana\u00EFs, and has been a major trading route ever since.\nTanais appears in ancient Greek sources as the name of the river and of a city on it, situated in the Maeotian marshes. The name derives however from Scythian (Iranian) \"D\u0101nu\" \"river\", akin to modern Ossetic \"don\" \"river\".\nAt its easternmost point, the Don comes near the Volga, and the Volga-Don Canal (length ca. 105\u00A0km (65 miles)), connecting both rivers, has been a major waterway. The Khazar fortress of Sarkel used to dominate this point in the Middle Ages. This part of the river saw Operation Uranus, one of the turning points of the Second World War.\nThe Don has given its name to the Don Cossacks who settled the fertile valley of the river in the 16th and 17th centuries. In modern literature, the Don figures centrally in the works of Mikhail Sholokhov, a Cossack from the stanitsa of Veshenskaya.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":44},{"uri":"Tula%2C_Russia","surface_form":"Tula","offset":110},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":129},{"uri":"Sea_of_Azov","surface_form":"Sea of Azov","offset":201},{"uri":"Voronezh","surface_form":"Voronezh","offset":266},{"uri":"Rostov_on_Don","surface_form":"Rostov on Don","offset":335},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":359},{"uri":"Donets","surface_form":"Donets","offset":374},{"uri":"Book_of_Jubilees","surface_form":"Book of Jubilees","offset":477},{"uri":"Japheth","surface_form":"Japheth","offset":619},{"uri":"Shem","surface_form":"Shem","offset":652},{"uri":"Sons_of_Noah","surface_form":"sons of Noah","offset":671},{"uri":"Scythia","surface_form":"Scythia","offset":713},{"uri":"Tanais","surface_form":"Tanais","offset":807},{"uri":"Maeotian_marshes","surface_form":"Maeotian marshes","offset":909},{"uri":"Ossetic_language","surface_form":"Ossetic","offset":1007},{"uri":"Volga","surface_form":"Volga","offset":1079},{"uri":"Volga-Don_Canal","surface_form":"Volga-Don Canal","offset":1094},{"uri":"Khazar","surface_form":"Khazar","offset":1197},{"uri":"Sarkel","surface_form":"Sarkel","offset":1216},{"uri":"Operation_Uranus","surface_form":"Operation Uranus","offset":1298},{"uri":"Turning_Point","surface_form":"turning points","offset":1327},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":1349},{"uri":"Cossacks","surface_form":"Cossacks","offset":1405},{"uri":"Mikhail_Sholokhov","surface_form":"Mikhail Sholokhov","offset":1554},{"uri":"Stanitsa","surface_form":"stanitsa","offset":1592}]}
