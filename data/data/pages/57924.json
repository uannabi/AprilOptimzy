{"id":57924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Solar_One","text":"e=\"preserve\">Nevada Solar One is the third biggest solar power plant in the world, generating 64MW. It was built in Boulder City, Nevada.\nNevada Solar One is a solar thermal power station and will use parabolic troughs, heating tubes of liquid (solar receivers). These solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel.\nNevada Solar One also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase-changing molten salts. This energy can then be drawn on at night.\nNevada Solar One started producing electricity in the June 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solar_power","surface_form":"solar power","offset":51},{"uri":"Boulder_City%2C_Nevada","surface_form":"Boulder City","offset":116},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":130},{"uri":"Solar_thermal","surface_form":"solar thermal","offset":160},{"uri":"Trough_concentrator","surface_form":"parabolic troughs","offset":201}]}
