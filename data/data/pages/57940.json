{"id":57940,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_I","text":"Clovis I (variously spelled Chlodowech or Chlodwig, giving modern French \"Louis\" and modern German \"Ludwig\") (c. 466 \u2013 November 27, 511) was the first king of the Franks who united that nation. He succeeded his father Childeric I in 481 as King of the Salian Franks, one of two main groups of Frankish tribes, They were occupying the area west of the lower Rhine at that time, with their centre around Tournai and Cambrai along the modern frontier between France and Belgium. Clovis conquered the neighbouring Frankish tribes and established himself as sole king before his death.\nClovis converted to Catholicism, as opposed to the Arian Christianity that was common among Germanic peoples, because his wife, the Burgundian Clotilde, was a Catholic. He was baptized in the Cathedral of Reims. This act was very important in the following history of France and Western Europe in general, because he expanded his reign over almost all of the old Roman province of Gaul (roughly modern France). He is considered to be the founder both of France (which his state closely resembled geographically at his death) and the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Franks for the next two centuries.\nPlace of birth\u00A0: Tournai (Belgium), Place of death: Paris (France).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"modern French","offset":59},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"modern German","offset":85},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Franks","offset":163},{"uri":"Childeric_I","surface_form":"Childeric I","offset":218},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":357},{"uri":"Tournai","surface_form":"Tournai","offset":402},{"uri":"Beaumetz-l%C3%A8s-Cambrai","surface_form":"Cambrai","offset":414},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":456},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":467},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholicism","offset":601},{"uri":"Arianism","surface_form":"Arian","offset":632},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":638},{"uri":"Clotilde","surface_form":"Clotilde","offset":724},{"uri":"Reims","surface_form":"Reims","offset":786},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":849},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":860},{"uri":"Gaul","surface_form":"Gaul","offset":962},{"uri":"Merovingian_dynasty","surface_form":"Merovingian dynasty","offset":1114}]}
