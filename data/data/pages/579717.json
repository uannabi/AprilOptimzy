{"id":579717,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_filings","text":"=\"preserve\">Iron filings are tiny rods of iron. They are often used to show the effects of magnetic fields. Since iron is magnetic, the filings become small bar magnets. Each filing attracts other filings, so the filings eventually look like the magnetic field the original magnet has.\nIron filings are made accidentally when working iron. Iron filings\u2019 only uses are to teach magnetic fields, and to be eaten for people who need iron.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":42},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic fields","offset":91},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"bar magnets","offset":157}]}
