It has a vertical axle, and is very much like the windlass, which has a horizontal axle.\nGrip on power pull capstan and it's opposite brakeforce on bollard posts; both work thru Capstan Equation\nMan powered capstan is a 2nd Class Lever concentrating man force inwards to smaller radius for more power from levers.\nMotor powered capstan spins motor shaft from inside post/not outside levers so is a 3rd Class Lever delivering force wider radius than motor shaft force input.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":28},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":60},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":74},{"uri":"Cable","surface_form":"cable","offset":84},{"uri":"Axle","surface_form":"axle","offset":132},{"uri":"Windlass","surface_form":"windlass","offset":164},{"uri":"Capstan_equation","surface_form":"Capstan Equation","offset":292},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"2nd Class Lever","offset":334},{"uri":"Lever","surface_form":"3rd Class Lever","offset":512}]}
