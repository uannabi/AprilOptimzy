Ivey is the first woman to be Alabama's governor since Lurleen Wallace, who succeeded her husband George Wallace in 1967.\nIvey was born an only child to Boadman Nettles Ivey and Barbara Ivey.

She was cancer-free in January 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":45},{"uri":"List_of_Governors_of_Alabama","surface_form":"54th","offset":77},{"uri":"Governor_of_Alabama","surface_form":"Governor","offset":94},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":106},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":138},{"uri":"Alabama_State_Treasurer","surface_form":"Alabama State Treasurer","offset":180},{"uri":"List_of_lieutenant_governors_of_Alabama","surface_form":"30th","offset":243},{"uri":"Lieutenant_Governor_of_Alabama","surface_form":"Lieutenant Governor","offset":248},{"uri":"Robert_J._Bentley","surface_form":"Robert J.
