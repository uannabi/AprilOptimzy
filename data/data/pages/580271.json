She was the mother of late-night talk show host David Letterman. She made many telephone and live guest appearances on his shows: \"Late Night\" and \"Late Show\".\nFollowing several years of appearing through telephone, Mengering (usually known as \"Dave's Mom\" or \"Dave's Mom Dorothy\", with no mention of her surname) became a recurring on-camera guest on Letterman's subsequent \"Late Show\", initially by covering the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.\nIn 2015, Mengering suffered a stroke, but recovered months later. Mengering died on April 11, 2017 at her home in Carmel, Indiana at the age of 95. She died one day before Letterman's 70th birthday.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"David_Letterman","surface_form":"David Letterman","offset":145},{"uri":"Late_Night_with_David_Letterman","surface_form":"Late Night","offset":228},{"uri":"Late_Show_with_David_Letterman","surface_form":"Late Show","offset":245},{"uri":"Surname","surface_form":"surname","offset":402},{"uri":"1994_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"1994 Winter Olympics","offset":511},{"uri":"Lillehammer","surface_form":"Lillehammer","offset":535},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":548},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":586},{"uri":"Carmel%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Carmel","offset":670}]}
