{"id":58057,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurd_(band)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Absurd is a national socialistic black metal band from Germany. The band was formed in 1992. Frontman of this band is Neo Nazi and former Satanist Hendrik M\u00F6bus\nThe band became notable after its (original) members murdered the 15-year-old Sandro Beyer in 1993. These members are no longer in the band. It is believed that Beyer knew of a relationship between Schauseil's and a married woman. She had been spreading rumors about this and other things the band was doing. On 29 April in Sondershausen, M\u00F6bus, Schauseil, and Kirchner met with Beyer. The strangled him there with an electrical cord. Kirchner was reported as saying: \u201COh shit\u2014now I\u2019ve completely ruined my life.\u201D Schauseil said he heard voices in his head saying \"\u201CKuster Maier\u201D\". This made no sense but was interpreted by him as \"\u201Ct\u00F6te Beyer\u201D\" (\u2018kill Beyer\u2019).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Black_metal","surface_form":"black metal","offset":46},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":58},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":68},{"uri":"1992","surface_form":"1992","offset":100},{"uri":"Neo_Nazi","surface_form":"Neo Nazi","offset":131},{"uri":"Satanism","surface_form":"Satanist","offset":151},{"uri":"Hendrik_M%C3%B6bus","surface_form":"Hendrik M\u00F6bus","offset":160},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":227},{"uri":"Sandro_Beyer","surface_form":"Sandro Beyer","offset":252},{"uri":"1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":268},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":351},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":390},{"uri":"Rumor","surface_form":"rumor","offset":428},{"uri":"Sondershausen","surface_form":"Sondershausen","offset":498},{"uri":"Strangle","surface_form":"strangle","offset":564},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electrical","offset":592},{"uri":"Cord","surface_form":"cord","offset":603},{"uri":"Interpretation","surface_form":"interpreted","offset":783}]}
