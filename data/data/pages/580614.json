Afterwards, Seigenthaler wrote about his experience in \"USA Today\". The incident raised questions about the reliability of Wikipedia and other websites with user-generated content that lack the legal accountability of traditional newspapers and published materials.\nAftermath.\nIn a December 13 interview, co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his support for Wikipedia policy allowing articles to be edited by anonymous users \u2013 describing the participation of editors in China and Iran in terms of privacy issues \u2013 but announced plans to roll back their article creation privileges as part of a vandalism-control strategy: \"...we've decided that we want to slow down...so starting in January we're preventing unregistered users from creating new pages, because so often those have to be deleted...\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Seigenthaler","surface_form":"John Seigenthaler","offset":211},{"uri":"Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"assassinations","offset":311},{"uri":"U.S._President","surface_form":"U.S. President","offset":329},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
