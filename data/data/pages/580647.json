{"id":580647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinchonism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cinchonism or quinism is poisoning from an overdose of cinchona alkaloids. Cinchona bark is the source of quinine and quindine. Quinine is used to treat malaria. In small amounts it is used in tonic water to give a bitter flavor. Cinchoism can be caused by medical doses of quinine or quindine.\nSigns and symptoms.\nPeople treated with quinine may also suffer from low blood sugar and hypotension (low blood pressure).\nMost symptoms of cinchonism (except in severe cases) are reversible and disappear once quinine is withdrawn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cinchona","surface_form":"Cinchona","offset":88},{"uri":"Quinine","surface_form":"quinine","offset":119},{"uri":"Quindine","surface_form":"quindine","offset":131},{"uri":"Malaria","surface_form":"malaria","offset":166},{"uri":"Tonic_water","surface_form":"tonic water","offset":206},{"uri":"Hypoglycemia","surface_form":"low blood sugar","offset":377},{"uri":"Hypotension","surface_form":"hypotension","offset":397},{"uri":"Blood_pressure","surface_form":"blood pressure","offset":414}]}
