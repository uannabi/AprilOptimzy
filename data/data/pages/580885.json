{"id":580885,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_New_York","text":"The coat of arms of the state of New York was formally adopted in 1778, and appears as a component of the state's flag and seal.\nThe shield displays a masted ship and a sloop on the Hudson River (symbols of inland and foreign commerce), bordered by a grassy shore and a mountain range in the background with the sun rising behind it. The sun has a face on it. The unheraldic nature of the Hudson River landscape reveals the modern origin of the design.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["coat of arms"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"coat of arms","offset":4},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":33},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":114},{"uri":"Heraldry","surface_form":"unheraldic","offset":364},{"uri":"Hudson_River","surface_form":"Hudson River","offset":389}]}
