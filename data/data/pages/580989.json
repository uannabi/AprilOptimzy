He was a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.\nGei\u00DFler studied law and philosophy in Munich and T\u00FCbingen, where he graduated in 1960.\nGei\u00DFler served as German minister for youth, family, and health from 1982 to 1985 and also general secretary of the CDU from 1977 to 1989.\nFrom being a conservative right-winger until the early 1990s, Gei\u00DFler became increasingly leftist in his views as far as social policy and globalization are concerned.\nIn 2007, he announced he had become a member of the attac network. This happened weeks before the 2007 G8 summit, which Germany, holding the 2007 G8 presidency, was hosting. Gei\u00DFler himself said that his joining of attac had to be seen in the context of the upcoming G8 summit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":80},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":87},{"uri":"Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany","surface_form":"Christian Democratic Union","offset":122},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":178},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":186},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":200},{"uri":"T%C3%BCbingen","surface_form":"T\u00FCbingen","offset":211},{"uri":"Conservative","surface_form":"conservative","offset":401},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":414},{"uri":"Leftist","surface_form":"leftist","offset":478},{"uri":"Social_policy","surface_form":"social policy","offset":509},{"uri":"Globalization","surface_form":"globalization","offset":527},{"uri":"Association_pour_la_taxation_des_transactions_pour_l%27aide_aux_citoyens","surface_form":"attac","offset":608},{"uri":"33rd_G8_summit","surface_form":"2007 G8 summit","offset":654}]}
