It was in an area of operations more local and major partisan formations, and in 1943/1944, and headquarters support unit of the Supreme Headquarters of the NLA. In fact, before the second session of AVNOJ in Jajce (1943), here he was Supreme Partisan Headquarters, led by Josip Broz Tito. Tito himself was placed under Petrovo Polje, in the village of Kova\u010Devi\u0107i, home reputable host Husein Kova\u010Devi\u0107, councilors of the local People's Committee \u0160iprage (Committee Chairman: Ismet Had\u017Eiselimovi\u0107).\nTo Petrovo Polje partisans have built a military airport with charged ground surface. The village is situated on the slopes of Petrovo Polje, in the valley of Vrbanja river, below the plateau Petrovo Pulje. Some sources stated that Tito at that time lived \"in a small village below Petrovo Polje\".\nThere have been prepared and (fire) marked areas for aviation supply of medical support and weaponry allies and goings of their delegates. So at this place, before the second session of AVNOJ, in Jajce (1943) the (by parachutes) and hung the English mission in connection with the NLA, headed by Major William Deakin.\nOver Imljani hired less power, because between them and Kori\u0107anske stijene is a deep gorge of the river gorge Ilomska.\nThe majority of Chetnik Force in the field headed by Petrovo Polje and Lisina Mountain. By winning the dominant areas Lisina, would open the quickest way to advance (via Ilomska) to the Hospital.\nOver Imljani and Petrovo Polje attacked the Chetniks from Manja\u010Da (the Chetnik detachments \"Ko\u010Di\u0107\", \"King Petar II Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107\") and detachment \"Obili\u0107\" of Lazo Te\u0161anovi\u0107. Over Petrovo Polje, according to Lisina, performed famous Chetnik Rade Radi\u0107 and combined power Chetnik's Battalion \"Karadjordje\" and \"Tankosi\u0107\", under the command of Mihajlo \u0110uri\u0107. The entire campaign was commanded Chetnik \"commander of the operation\", Major Slavoljub Vranje\u0161evi\u0107.\nAt the same time, the first battalion of partisan detachments in Kori\u0107ani and three battalions of the 1st Krajina Brigade went to get some food in Pougarje, on the other side of the canyon of the Ugar. So the defense Hospitals could only organized the 2nd Battalion detachment and one battalion of 14. Centralbosnian Stroke Brigade. Since all were exhausted typhus, hospital was in great danger. That is why the headquarters detachment dispatched couriers to seek his 1st Battalion, which was more numerous. These forces is to be defended part of the front of the river, a left tributary Ilomska to its pouring in Ugar. The rest of the front, to the north, defended the fighters detachment, with the help of troops from Jajce, with the task of defending the line at all costs, because the penetration of the Chetniks in Kori\u0107ani was fatal for the hospital and for units that defend it. Second Battalion detachment had the most about 120 fighters healthy and able to fight. Coincidentally, he had, will prove decisive weapon: 12 machine guns and heavy machine gun brand \"Breda\".\nWhen, from the direction of Petrovo Polje, from hot springs Bijeljine, Chetniks went to Lisina partisans fired a machine-gun burst, which made them develop their forces along Ilomska, the front length of about three kilometers. It is much easier for a planned action of partisans, because the Chetniks were forced to due precautions, ineffective fire while approaching through the dense forest.\nIn a dramatic showdown on Lisina partisans, thanks to the efficiency of the machine gunners, avoid taking the tactically important positions. They literally mowed Chetniks in storming the slopes of the mountain to the Ravni Omar, causing him a key and final defeat on this ground.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia","surface_form":"Central Bosnia","offset":46},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":62},{"uri":"Republika_Srpska","surface_form":"Republika Srpska","offset":90},{"uri":"Kne%C5%BEevo","surface_form":"Kne\u017Eevo","offset":108},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":200},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":256},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Yugoslavia","offset":307},{"uri":"Imljani","surface_form":"Imljani","offset":378},{"uri":"Vla%C5%A1i%C4%87_(mountain)","surface_form":"Vla\u0161i\u0107","offset":551},{"uri":"Mala_Ilomska","surface_form":"Mala Ilomska","offset":631},{"uri":"Turbe_(Travnik)","surface_form":"Turbe","offset":765},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":865},{"uri":"Local_community","surface_form":"Local community","offset":1119},{"uri":"Imljani","surface_form":"Imljani","offset":1299},{"uri":"IFOR","surface_form":"IFOR","offset":1410},{"uri":"Power_grid","surface_form":"power grid","offset":1439},{"uri":"Water_supply","surface_form":"water supply","offset":1454},{"uri":"Kne%C5%BEevo","surface_form":"Kne\u017Eevo","offset":1487},{"uri":"Vla%C5%A1i%C4%87_(mountain)","surface_form":"Babanovac","offset":1758},{"uri":"Ilomska","surface_form":"Ilomska","offset":1808},{"uri":"Ugar_(river)","surface_form":"Ugar","offset":1913},{"uri":"Vitovlje%2C_Travnik","surface_form":"Vitovlje","offset":1925},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1955},{"uri":"Partisan_(military)","surface_form":"partisan","offset":2089},{"uri":"National_Liberation_Army_(Yugoslavia)","surface_form":"NLA","offset":2193},{"uri":"AVNOJ","surface_form":"AVNOJ","offset":2236},{"uri":"Jajce","surface_form":"Jajce","offset":2245},{"uri":"Headquarter","surface_form":"Headquarter","offset":2288},{"uri":"Josip_Broz_Tito","surface_form":"Josip Broz Tito","offset":2309},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":2482},{"uri":"Military_airport","surface_form":"military airport","offset":2574},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":2693},{"uri":"Josip_Broz_Tito","surface_form":"Tito","offset":2766},{"uri":"AVNOJ","surface_form":"AVNOJ","offset":3018},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English mission","offset":3074},{"uri":"William_Deakin","surface_form":"William Deakin","offset":3134},{"uri":"Imljani","surface_form":"Imljani","offset":3155},{"uri":"Kori%C4%87anske_stijene","surface_form":"Kori\u0107anske stijene","offset":3206},{"uri":"Ilomska","surface_form":"Ilomska","offset":3260},{"uri":"Ilomska","surface_form":"Ilomska","offset":3439},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"Hospital","offset":3455},{"uri":"Manja%C4%8Da","surface_form":"Manja\u010Da","offset":3523},{"uri":"Petar_II_Kara%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87","surface_form":"Petar II Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107","offset":3571},{"uri":"Chetnik","surface_form":"Chetnik","offset":3696},{"uri":"Chetnik","surface_form":"Chetnik","offset":3734},{"uri":"Karadjordje","surface_form":"Karadjordje","offset":3755},{"uri":"Kori%C4%87ani","surface_form":"Kori\u0107ani","offset":3986},{"uri":"Pougarje_(valley)","surface_form":"Pougarje","offset":4068},{"uri":"Ugar_(river)","surface_form":"Ugar","offset":4117},{"uri":"Ilomska","surface_form":"Ilomska","offset":4509},{"uri":"Ugar_(river)","surface_form":"Ugar","offset":4535},{"uri":"Jajce","surface_form":"Jajce","offset":4641},{"uri":"Chetniks","surface_form":"Chetniks","offset":4729},{"uri":"Kori%C4%87ani","surface_form":"Kori\u0107ani","offset":4741},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":4972},{"uri":"Breda","surface_form":"Breda","offset":4991},{"uri":"Chetniks","surface_form":"Chetniks","offset":5070},{"uri":"Ilomska","surface_form":"Ilomska","offset":5174},{"uri":"Chetniks","surface_form":"Chetniks","offset":5557}]}
