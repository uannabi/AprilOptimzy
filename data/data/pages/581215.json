He experienced World War I as a child, and World War II as an adult. After surviving the Holocaust, he immigrated to Israel.\nDuring World War II he was confined by the Nazi regime to a Jewish ghetto. His children died in the ghetto, but he and his wife were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Kristal survived the Holocaust, but his wife did not. He remarried shortly after the War and, in 1950, emigrated to Haifa, Israel, with his second wife Batsheva, also a survivor of the Holocaust, and their infant child, and lived in Haifa until his death at age 113 years, 330 days.\nKristal celebrated his bar mitzvah in September 2016 at age 113 after being unable to do so at age 13 due to World War I, and was the 16th man to live to age 113. That year, Kristal, who was the oldest survivor of the Holocaust, also became the world's oldest living man and last living man born in 1903, after Japaneseman Yasutaro Koide's death on January 18 (Koide died January 19 Japanese time).\nKristal died at his home in Haifa on August 11, 2017, just 5 weeks before his 114th birthday, and was succeeded as the world's oldest living man by Spaniard Francisco N\u00FA\u00F1ez Olivera (who, however, was not verified until his death on January 29, 2018 at age 113 years, 47 days).
