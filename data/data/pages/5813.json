{"id":5813,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kinetic energy is the energy that an object has because of its motion. This energy can be converted into other kinds, such as gravitational or electric potential energy, which is the energy that an object has because of its position in a gravitational or electric field.\nDifference between Kinetic & Potential Energy.\nKinetic Energy is the maximum amount of work a moving body due to its motion can do, whereas Potential energy is the maximum amount of work a body can do due to its configuration or position in a field force. Kinetic Energy is valid for all sorts of forces as seen from this derivation.\nbut Potential Energy is not as can be seen here\nwhich clearly suggests that only conservative forces can have potential energy associated with them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":35},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"motion","offset":76},{"uri":"Gravitational","surface_form":"gravitational","offset":139},{"uri":"Potential_energy","surface_form":"potential energy","offset":165},{"uri":"Potential_energy","surface_form":"Potential energy","offset":424}]}
