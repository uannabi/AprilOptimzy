Quedlinburg is 8 kilometers north of the Harz mountains. A small river called Bode flows through the city. In 1994 UNESCO added the old town Quedlinburg on the list of World Heritage Sites.\nHistory.\nIn the year 922 the name Quedlinburg was first mentioned in a paper from King Henry I the Fowler of Germany. In the first half of the 10th century the Hungarians with their horses attacked many places all over central Europe. King Henry built up a castle to give the farmers around a place to hide. In 936 the king died and his body was buried on the castle hill in Quedlinburg. His widow Matilda and his son King Otto I set up a convent for ladies. The tasks of this convent included the commemoration of King Henry I and the education of young ladies to get better chances to get married. This convent on the hill was dissolved in 1803. First abbess of the ladies-convent was Matilda, the daughter of King Otto I and granddaughter of Queen Matilda.\nIn the valley north of that hill in 994 King Otto III founded the old town. He was asked to do so by his aunt abbess Matilda.\nThis old town was used by merchants to sell and buy textiles and so it grew larger. In the middle of the 12th century a new town was created by the abbess of the ladies-convent. In 1330 both towns were united. They got stronger in power and in 1477 they tried to get totally independent of the abbess. But military troops sent by the brothers of the abbess occupied both towns.\nAll the citizens got under control of the abbess again. In 1541 the Protestant Reformation reached the convent and the town and everybody changed their beliefs to the Protestant religion.\nSurprisingly during the Thirty Years' War the town was not destroyed because the abbess made diplomatic arrangements with all the bypassing military leaders.\nGeography and Climate.\nThe city is 8\u00A0kilometers north of the Harz mountains around 123\u00A0meters above sea water level.
