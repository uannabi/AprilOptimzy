It can be found in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia.\nSome specimens of Morelia amethistina have been measured at up to 8.5 metres (27.9 feet) long, but normally they are only up to 5 metres long.\nThe diet of the Amethystine python is mostly birds, bats, rats, possums, and other small mammals. Some big Australian and Papuan varieties eat wallabies and cuscus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Python","surface_form":"python","offset":130},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":157},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":168},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":190},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":348},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":389},{"uri":"Bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":396},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":402},{"uri":"Possum","surface_form":"possum","offset":408},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":433},{"uri":"Wallaby","surface_form":"wallabies","offset":487},{"uri":"Cuscus","surface_form":"cuscus","offset":501}]}
