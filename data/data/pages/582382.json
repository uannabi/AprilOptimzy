{"id":582382,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs","text":"=\"preserve\">Mad Libs is a fill-in-the-blank word game invented in 1958 by Roger Price and Leonard B. Stern.\nOne player chooses a story and then replaces words with blanks containing (noun, verb, part of body plural, celebrity male, etc.). The other player fills in the blanks by saying the type of the word, but without showing where it is in the story and the words around it. A usually nonsensical story will be made.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roger_Price","surface_form":"Roger Price","offset":74},{"uri":"Leonard_B._Stern","surface_form":"Leonard B.
