{"id":582425,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)","text":"=\"preserve\">In baseball, a grand slam is a home run hit with runners on first, second, and third base (\"bases loaded\"). This scores four runs and is the most possible in one play.\nAccording to \"The Dickson Baseball Dictionary\", the term came from the card game of contract bridge. A \"grand slam\" in contract bridge involves taking all the possible tricks. The word \"slam\", by itself, can mean a loud sound, such as a door being closed with a lot of force. \"Slamming the door\" on one's opponent(s), is similar to the bat slamming the ball into a home run.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":15},{"uri":"Home_run","surface_form":"home run","offset":43},{"uri":"Run_(baseball)","surface_form":"runs","offset":137},{"uri":"Contract_bridge","surface_form":"contract bridge","offset":264}]}
