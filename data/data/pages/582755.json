{"id":582755,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hampton","text":"Bruce Hampton (born Gustav Valentine Berglund III; April 30, 1947 \u2013 May 1, 2017) was an American musician.\nCareer.\nIn the late 1960s he was a founding member of Atlanta, Georgia's avant-garde Hampton Grease Band. Adopting the moniker Colonel Hampton B. Coles, Retired or alternatively Col. Bruce Hampton Ret., and sometimes playing a sort of dwarf guitar called a \"chazoid\", he later formed several other bands. Some of those band names include The Late Bronze Age, The Aquarium Rescue Unit, The Fiji Mariners, The Codetalkers, The Quark Alliance, Pharaoh Gummitt, and Madrid Express.\nDeath.\nOn May 1, 2017, Hampton was being honored with a concert featuring his friends at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia for his 70th birthday when he collapsed on-stage of a heart attack during an encore performance of \"Turn on Your Lovelight.\" As a result, Hampton lay slumped over an amplifier on the edge of the stage for several minutes before he was taken offstage for medical attention; because people thought he was joking. He died shortly thereafter at Emory University Hospital Midtown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlanta%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Atlanta, Georgia","offset":161},{"uri":"Avant-garde","surface_form":"avant-garde","offset":180},{"uri":"Hampton_Grease_Band","surface_form":"Hampton Grease Band","offset":192},{"uri":"Aquarium_Rescue_Unit","surface_form":"Aquarium Rescue Unit","offset":470},{"uri":"The_Codetalkers","surface_form":"The Codetalkers","offset":511},{"uri":"The_Quark_Alliance","surface_form":"The Quark Alliance","offset":528},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":764},{"uri":"Emory_University_Hospital_Midtown","surface_form":"Emory University Hospital Midtown","offset":1051}]}
