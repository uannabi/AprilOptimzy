Aten was pictured as a sun with rays that ended in hands.\nThe deified Aten is the focus of the monotheistic religion of Atenism established by Amenhotep IV, who later took the name Akhenaten in worship and recognition of the Aten. In his poem \"Great Hymn to the Aten\", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, and giver of life. Akhenaten was the first person to attempt to make a monotheistic religion.\nThe worship of Aten was eradicated by Horemheb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":24},{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"Egyptian mythology","offset":39},{"uri":"Ra","surface_form":"Ra","offset":88},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":115},{"uri":"Monotheism","surface_form":"monotheistic","offset":187},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":200},{"uri":"Atenism","surface_form":"Atenism","offset":212},{"uri":"Amenhotep_IV","surface_form":"Amenhotep IV","offset":235},{"uri":"Akhenaten","surface_form":"Akhenaten","offset":273},{"uri":"Great_Hymn_to_the_Aten","surface_form":"Great Hymn to the Aten","offset":336},{"uri":"Horemheb","surface_form":"Horemheb","offset":532}]}
