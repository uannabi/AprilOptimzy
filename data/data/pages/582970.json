She studied at New York University and at the University of Iowa.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1996 she shared the inaugural March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology with Ralph L. Brinster for their work in developing transgenic mice. Much of her career has been spent at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia where, in 2002, she was named to the Jack Schultz Chair in Basic Science. Mintz is a member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":45},{"uri":"Embryologist","surface_form":"embryologist","offset":54},{"uri":"Genetic_modification","surface_form":"genetic modification","offset":106},{"uri":"Cellular_differentiation","surface_form":"cellular differentiation","offset":128},{"uri":"Melanoma","surface_form":"melanoma","offset":178},{"uri":"Chimera_(genetics)","surface_form":"chimeric","offset":295},{"uri":"Transgenic","surface_form":"transgenic","offset":308},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":378},{"uri":"New_York_University","surface_form":"New York University","offset":408},{"uri":"University_of_Iowa","surface_form":"University of Iowa","offset":439},{"uri":"March_of_Dimes_Prize_in_Developmental_Biology","surface_form":"March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology","offset":511},{"uri":"Ralph_L._Brinster","surface_form":"Ralph L.
