It is based on a plan first publicly released by House Republicans on March 6, 2017, and the first part of what is a 3-phase plan to repeal the act.\nConsideration of the bill was postponed on March\u00A024, 2017, after it failed to gain enough House Republican support to pass it. Towards the end of April 2017, Republicans began trying to revive the bill with the MacArthur Amendment, named after Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey.\nOn May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted in favor of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and passing the American Health Care Act with a narrow vote of 217 to 213, sending the bill to the Senate for a full majority vote.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"United States Congress","offset":257},{"uri":"Bill_(law)","surface_form":"bill","offset":280},{"uri":"Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act","surface_form":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","offset":311},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House","offset":422},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republicans","offset":428},{"uri":"Tom_MacArthur","surface_form":"Tom MacArthur","offset":781}]}
