{"id":583418,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubias_afzelii","text":"\"Anubias afzelii\" is a plant in the Araceae family. It was first described for science in 1857 by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott. That description was based on material collected in Sierra Leone by Adam Afzelius. Schott named the species after him. The genus \"Anubias\" was described at the same time. Only \"A. afzellii\" belonged to it. This is therefore the type species of the genus. \"A. afzelii\" was the first species of this genus known to science.\nWhere it grows.\nThe plant is found in West Africa: Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Mali.\nDescription.\nThe plant's leave blades are elongated (long and thin) and leathery. They can be up to long and wide. The leaf stems are generally shorter than the blade. The leaves are set on a creeping and rooting rhizome. It is thick. The spathe is long (sometimes up to 9 cm long). It has a long peduncle. The spadix is long (sometimes up to 12 cm long). It is a little bit longer than the spathe. Therefore, the tip of the spadix sticks a little bit out of the spathe. The upper part of the spadix is covered with male flowers. Their 5-6 stamens are fused. The anthers (also called thecae) are on the sides. The lower part of the spadix is covered with female flowers. These are reduced to the ovary and stigma.\nEcology.\nThe plant grows in wet, shady places. It flowers from the end of March to July. It fruits from April to September. The plant grows above water, but can sometimes be completely under water.\nGrowing conditions.\nThis plant grows best when only partly under water and when not crowded by other plants. It is most suited for the paludarium. It can also be used in larger aquariums, where it grows very slowly. It does not need much light. It prefers a temperature range of 22-26 \u00B0C. It can be propagated by dividing the rhizome. Propagation by seed is also easy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":23},{"uri":"Araceae","surface_form":"Araceae","offset":36},{"uri":"Heinrich_Wilhelm_Schott","surface_form":"Heinrich Wilhelm Schott","offset":98},{"uri":"Sierra_Leone","surface_form":"Sierra Leone","offset":175},{"uri":"Adam_Afzelius","surface_form":"Adam Afzelius","offset":191},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":351},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":483},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":496},{"uri":"Guinea","surface_form":"Guinea","offset":505},{"uri":"Sierra_Leone","surface_form":"Sierra Leone","offset":513},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":531},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"leaf stems","offset":656},{"uri":"Rhizome","surface_form":"rhizome","offset":750},{"uri":"Spathe","surface_form":"spathe","offset":776},{"uri":"Spadix","surface_form":"spadix","offset":848},{"uri":"Stamen","surface_form":"stamen","offset":1077},{"uri":"Gynoecium","surface_form":"ovary","offset":1233},{"uri":"Stigma_(botany)","surface_form":"stigma","offset":1243},{"uri":"Paludarium","surface_form":"paludarium","offset":1584},{"uri":"Aquarium","surface_form":"aquarium","offset":1626},{"uri":"Plant_propagation","surface_form":"propagated","offset":1748}]}
