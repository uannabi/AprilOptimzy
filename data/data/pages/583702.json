They received 2.65% of the vote. Ishihara announced his retirement from politics two days after the election.\nAccording to Ayako Mie, the party's policies are \"a mix of conservative security policies, stricter immigration laws and advocacy of traditional values on the one hand, and 'liberalism' in economic areas on the other, such as pursuing regulatory reform.\" The party is also patriotic. The party is seen as right-wing or far-right.\nDissolved on 1 November 2018. Last party leader is Kyoko Nakayama.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":44},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":180},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":199},{"uri":"Japan_Restoration_Party","surface_form":"Japan Restoration Party","offset":210},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":282},{"uri":"Osaka","surface_form":"Osaka","offset":291},{"uri":"T%C5%8Dru_Hashimoto","surface_form":"T\u014Dru Hashimoto","offset":298},{"uri":"Shintaro_Ishihara","surface_form":"Shintaro Ishihara","offset":318},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":473},{"uri":"Japanese_general_election%2C_2014","surface_form":"2014 Japanese general election","offset":557},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":799},{"uri":"Traditional","surface_form":"traditional","offset":832},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberalism","offset":873},{"uri":"Patriotism","surface_form":"patriotic","offset":972},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":1004},{"uri":"Far-right_politics","surface_form":"far-right","offset":1018},{"uri":"Kyoko_Nakayama","surface_form":"Kyoko Nakayama","offset":1080}]}
