{"id":58374,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Euclidean geometry is a system in mathematics. People think Euclid was the first person who described it; therefore, it bears his name. He first described it in his textbook \"Elements\". The book was the first systematic discussion of geometry as it was known at the time. In the book, Euclid first assumes a few axioms. These form the base for later work. They are intuitively clear. Starting from those axioms, other theorems can be proven.\nIn the 19th century other forms of geometry were found. These are non-Euclidean geometry. Carl Friedrich Gauss, J\u00E1nos Bolyai, and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky were some people that developed such geometries. Very often, these do not use the parallel postulate, but the other four axioms.\nThe axioms.\nEuclid makes the following assumptions. These are axioms, and need not be proved.\nStatus.\nEuclidean geometry is a first-order theory. With it, statements like \"For all triangles...\" can be made, and be proven. Statements like \"For all sets of triangles...\" are outside the scope of the theory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":37},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":47},{"uri":"Euclid","surface_form":"Euclid","offset":73},{"uri":"Euclid%27s_Elements","surface_form":"Elements","offset":188},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":247},{"uri":"Axiom","surface_form":"axiom","offset":325},{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":431},{"uri":"Proof","surface_form":"proven","offset":447},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":462},{"uri":"Non-Euclidean_geometry","surface_form":"non-Euclidean geometry","offset":521},{"uri":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","surface_form":"Carl Friedrich Gauss","offset":545},{"uri":"J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai","surface_form":"J\u00E1nos Bolyai","offset":567},{"uri":"Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky","surface_form":"Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky","offset":585},{"uri":"Parallel_(geometry)","surface_form":"parallel","offset":697},{"uri":"Postulate","surface_form":"postulate","offset":706},{"uri":"First-order_theory","surface_form":"first-order theory","offset":870},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":924},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":991},{"uri":"Scope","surface_form":"scope","offset":1029}]}
