You find out whether you want to spit that taste out of your mouth or swallow it again.\"\nBeatty chose to follow up these words with a plan. He fired all but one of his defensive coordinators, and hired Jay Cobb, a former head coach at Knott County Central, Somerset, and Campbellsville, as the new defensive coordinator.
