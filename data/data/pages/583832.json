The city has a population of around 280,170 people.\nHistory.\nEvidence shows that people have lived in the Petrozavodsk region since seven thousand years ago. At the end of the sixteenth century, there was a settlement in the region that was named \"Onegaborg\".\nDuring the Finnish occupation of Petrozavodsk, the city was named \"\u00C4\u00E4nislinna\" (or \"\u00C4\u00E4neslinna\"). The city was retaken by the Soviet army on 28 June 1944. The Finns set up concentration camps in the city for people of non-Finnic ethnicity. In total, six camps were set up; which in total held 23,984 civilians of Russian ethnicity.\nIn 1977, the Petrozavodsk phenomenon occurred. This was an incident where a glowing object showered the city with many rays. Many people now believe that it was caused by the launch of the Soviet satellite Kosmos 955.\nThe Petrozavodsk State University is located in the city. The university is made up of 9 faculties and 6 institutes, and was founded on 1 September 1940.\nThere are many popular landmarks in Petrozavodsk. One of them is \"Lenin Square,\" which is an oval space with a large Vladimir Lenin statue in the center. The suburb of \"Martsialnye Vody\" is the oldest spa in Russia. It was founded in 1714 by Peter the Great. Petrozavodsk is home to the Karelia Philharmonic Orchestra, the Karelian Musical Theater, the National Library of Karelia, the National Theatre of Karelia and a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00F6ppen climate classification, Petrozavodsk experiences a subarctic climate. However, the city has much milder temperatures than other cities in that climate. This is mainly because of the city's position next to the Baltic Sea. The average annual temperature is 3.1 \u00B0C. Temperatures in winter range from 0 to -15 \u00B0C, in summer from +5 to +25 \u00B0C.
