He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001.\nIn 1982, Packard lost the Republican primary for the United States House of Representatives in a crowded field of candidates to Johnnie Crean by 92 votes. After Crean faced controversy, such as laying about being endorsed by then-President Ronald Reagan, Packard ran as a write-in candidate. He won the election in 1982 beating Crean. Packard won the election by 11,000 votes to become the first independent write-in candidate to defeat candidates of both the Democratic and Republican parties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Doctor_of_Dental_Medicine","surface_form":"D.M.D.","offset":33},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":77},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":88},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":104},{"uri":"U.S._House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"U.S. House of Representatives","offset":133},{"uri":"U.S._Republican_Party","surface_form":"Republican","offset":208},{"uri":"Primary_election","surface_form":"primary","offset":219},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":235},{"uri":"Johnnie_Crean","surface_form":"Johnnie Crean","offset":310},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":422}]}
