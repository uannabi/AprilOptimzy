{"id":58428,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer_Is_Icumen_In","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Sumer Is Icumen In\" is a very old English song which can be sung as a round. It is the oldest example of a round that we know of. The composer is unknown. It was written down around the middle of the 13th century by a monk but we do not know whether that monk composed it, or whether it had been composed earlier.\nThe title means \"Summer has come in\". The round can be sung in six parts. There are also two parts which can be repeated again and again (an ostinato) throughout the piece. The language is Middle English and is based on the dialect spoken in Wessex, England at the time.\nMusic.\nTo sing as a round, one singer (or group of singers) would begin at the beginning, a second singer would start at the beginning as the first got to the point marked with the red cross, then the third would join in when the second singer got to the red cross, and so on until all six were singing. The repeated pattern is marked \"Pes\". The instructions are written in Latin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Round_(music)","surface_form":"round","offset":84},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":214},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":232},{"uri":"Ostinato","surface_form":"ostinato","offset":469},{"uri":"Middle_English","surface_form":"Middle English","offset":517},{"uri":"Wessex","surface_form":"Wessex","offset":570},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":973}]}
