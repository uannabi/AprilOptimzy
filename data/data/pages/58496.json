{"id":58496,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War","text":"The Iraq War was an armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein.\nThe conflict continued for much of the next ten years as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 3\u20134 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but left private security contractors in its place to continue the war. In 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant conquered much of northern Iraq. An American-led new coalition sent troops to help the government of Iraq.\nAustralia, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands and Poland were also involved in the war with support from the Kurdish Peshmerga.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2003_invasion_of_Iraq","surface_form":"invasion of Iraq","offset":63},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":85},{"uri":"Saddam_Hussein","surface_form":"Saddam Hussein","offset":144},{"uri":"Insurgency","surface_form":"insurgency","offset":220},{"uri":"Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","surface_form":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","offset":552},{"uri":"Combined_Joint_Task_Force_%E2%80%93_Operation_Inherent_Resolve","surface_form":"new coalition","offset":638},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":696},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":711},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"The Netherlands","offset":727},{"uri":"Peshmerga","surface_form":"Peshmerga","offset":814}]}
