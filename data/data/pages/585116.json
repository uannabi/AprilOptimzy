In 2015 he was appointed deputy health minister in the Fourth Netanyahu Government. Later that year he became the health minister, so he was included in the government coalition of ruling parties. In November 2017 he again became deputy health minister because he didn't agree that the government allowed repair activities on the national railway infrastructure on the Shabbat. Since May 17, 2020 he has been minister of construction in the Fifth Netanyahu Government.\nIn early April 2020, Litzman was diagnosed with COVID-19.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1948","surface_form":"1948","offset":56},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":64},{"uri":"Rabbi","surface_form":"rabbi","offset":87},{"uri":"Yahadut_HaTorah_HaMeuhedet","surface_form":"Yahadut HaTorah HaMeuhedet","offset":111},{"uri":"Agudat_Yisrael","surface_form":"Agudat Yisrael","offset":207},{"uri":"Hasidism","surface_form":"Hasidism","offset":293},{"uri":"Haredi_Judaism","surface_form":"Haredi Judaism","offset":314},{"uri":"Knesset","surface_form":"Knesset","offset":502},{"uri":"Fourth_Netanyahu_Government","surface_form":"Fourth Netanyahu Government","offset":566},{"uri":"Shabbat","surface_form":"Shabbat","offset":880},{"uri":"Fifth_Netanyahu_Government","surface_form":"Fifth Netanyahu Government","offset":952},{"uri":"COVID-19","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":1028}]}
