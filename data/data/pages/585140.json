Its average yearly discharge is at Bassano del Grappa in the Vicenza province.\nThe Brenta, together with the Piave river, formed the Venetian Lagoon.\nCourse.\nThe Brenta river starts between the \"Caldonazzo\" and \"Levico\" lakes, two small lakes in the Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00FCdtirol region, in the comune of Caldonazzo, Trento province, at an elevation of about. From here, the river flows through the \"Valsugana\", the valley that goes from Bassano del Grappa to Trento, first to the east and later to the south. In this part, the Brenta is joined by its main left tributary, the Cismon stream, in the \"comune\" Cismon del Grappa, province of Vicenza (the Bacchiglione river is larger but it joins the Brenta near the mouth).\nAfter the \"comune\" of Bassano del Grappa, the river flows through the \"Pianura Padana\" (the \"Valley of the Po river\"). Finally, it flows into the Adriatic Sea, near the \"comune\" of Chioggia in the Metropolitan City of Venice. Near the mouth, Brenta is joined in the locality \"Ca' Pasqua\" by the Bacchiglione river.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":27},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":49},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":101},{"uri":"S%C3%BCdtirol","surface_form":"S\u00FCdtirol","offset":110},{"uri":"Adriatic_Sea","surface_form":"Adriatic Sea","offset":150},{"uri":"Venice","surface_form":"Venice","offset":191},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":250},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":300},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"discharge","offset":315},{"uri":"Bassano_del_Grappa","surface_form":"Bassano del Grappa","offset":331},{"uri":"Vicenza","surface_form":"Vicenza","offset":357},{"uri":"Piave","surface_form":"Piave","offset":405},{"uri":"Venetian_Lagoon","surface_form":"Venetian Lagoon","offset":429},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"comune","offset":590},{"uri":"Caldonazzo","surface_form":"Caldonazzo","offset":600},{"uri":"Province_of_Trento","surface_form":"Trento","offset":612},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":635},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":857},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":879},{"uri":"Comune","surface_form":"comune","offset":895},{"uri":"Cismon_del_Grappa","surface_form":"Cismon del Grappa","offset":903},{"uri":"Bacchiglione","surface_form":"Bacchiglione","offset":947},{"uri":"Po_(river)","surface_form":"Po","offset":1124},{"uri":"Adriatic_Sea","surface_form":"Adriatic Sea","offset":1163},{"uri":"Chioggia","surface_form":"Chioggia","offset":1198},{"uri":"Metropolitan_City_of_Venice","surface_form":"Metropolitan City of Venice","offset":1214},{"uri":"Bacchiglione","surface_form":"Bacchiglione","offset":1312}]}
