{"id":585160,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lasorda","text":"Thomas Charles Lasorda (September 22, 1927 \u2013 January 7, 2021) was a Major League Baseball player. He had a long career in sports management.\nIn 2009, he marked his sixth decade in one capacity or another with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, the longest discontinuous (he played one season with the Kansas City Athletics) tenure anyone has had with the team, edging Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully by two seasons. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 1997.\nLasorda came out of retirement to manage the United States team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He led the Americans to the gold medal, beating heavily favored Cuba, which had won the gold medals at the two previous Olympics.\nWith the death of Red Schoendienst on June 6, 2018, Lasorda was the oldest living Hall-of-Famer.\nIn November 2020, Lasorda was hospitalized and was discharged the next month. On January 7, 2021, Lasorda went to cardiac arrest at his home in Fullerton, California and died a few hours later, aged 93.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":68},{"uri":"Sports_management","surface_form":"sports management","offset":122},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Dodgers","surface_form":"Los Angeles Dodgers","offset":213},{"uri":"Vin_Scully","surface_form":"Vin Scully","offset":390},{"uri":"National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum","surface_form":"National Baseball Hall of Fame","offset":442},{"uri":"United_States_national_baseball_team","surface_form":"United States team","offset":540},{"uri":"2000_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"2000 Summer Olympics","offset":566},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":590},{"uri":"Baseball_at_the_2000_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"gold medal","offset":637},{"uri":"Cuba_national_baseball_team","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":673},{"uri":"Red_Schoendienst","surface_form":"Red Schoendienst","offset":757},{"uri":"Cardiac_arrest","surface_form":"cardiac arrest","offset":950},{"uri":"Fullerton%2C_California","surface_form":"Fullerton, California","offset":980}]}
