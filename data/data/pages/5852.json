{"id":5852,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Creative Commons licenses relates to the name of several copyright licenses released on December 16, 2002. The licenses were released by \"Creative Commons\", a United States nonprofit corporation. Everybody can put their own creations under these licenses.\nIt is possible to combine the license elements to allow people to use a work under certain conditions. For example, a combination of the first and fourth is called \"CC BY-SA\". This stands for \"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike\". With this license other people can use the work for free, but they must give credit to the original creator, and when they make something new with the work they must give it the same \"CC BY-SA\" license.\nCriticism.\nThe Free Software Foundation thinks that the Creative Commons system is confusing, because people often forget to tell which of the licenses they use. Instead they suggest to use the Free Art license.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":74},{"uri":"Creative_Commons","surface_form":"Creative Commons","offset":155},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":176},{"uri":"Nonprofit_corporation","surface_form":"nonprofit corporation","offset":190},{"uri":"Free_Software_Foundation","surface_form":"Free Software Foundation","offset":726},{"uri":"Free_Art_license","surface_form":"Free Art license","offset":905}]}
