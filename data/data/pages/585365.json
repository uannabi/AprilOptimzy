{"id":585365,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott","text":"David Randolph \"Dave\" Scott (born June 6, 1932), (Col, USAF, Ret.), is an American former NASA astronaut, retired U.S. Air Force officer and former test pilot. He belonged to the third group of NASA astronauts, selected in October 1963. As an astronaut, Scott became the seventh person to walk on the Moon.\nAs an astronaut, Scott made his first flight into space as pilot of the Gemini 8 mission, along with Neil Armstrong, in March 1966, spending just under eleven hours in low Earth orbit. Scott then spent ten days in orbit as Command Module Pilot aboard Apollo 9, his second spaceflight, along with Commander James McDivitt and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart.\nDuring this mission, Scott became the last American to fly solo in Earth orbit (not counting subsequent untethered EVAs). Scott made his third and final flight into space as commander of the Apollo 15 mission, the fourth human lunar landing, becoming the seventh person to walk on the Moon and the first person to drive on the Moon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colonel_(United_States)","surface_form":"Col","offset":50},{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"USAF","offset":55},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":90},{"uri":"Astronaut","surface_form":"astronaut","offset":95},{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"U.S. Air Force officer","offset":114},{"uri":"Test_pilot","surface_form":"test pilot","offset":148},{"uri":"NASA_Astronaut_Group_3","surface_form":"third group of NASA astronauts","offset":179},{"uri":"List_of_people_who_have_walked_on_the_Moon","surface_form":"walk","offset":289},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":301},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"space","offset":357},{"uri":"Gemini_8","surface_form":"Gemini 8","offset":379},{"uri":"Neil_Armstrong","surface_form":"Neil Armstrong","offset":408},{"uri":"Low_Earth_orbit","surface_form":"low Earth orbit","offset":475},{"uri":"Apollo_Command/Service_Module","surface_form":"Command Module","offset":530},{"uri":"Apollo_9","surface_form":"Apollo 9","offset":558},{"uri":"James_McDivitt","surface_form":"James McDivitt","offset":613},{"uri":"Apollo_Lunar_Module","surface_form":"Lunar Module","offset":632},{"uri":"Rusty_Schweickart","surface_form":"Rusty Schweickart","offset":651},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":743},{"uri":"Manned_Maneuvering_Unit","surface_form":"untethered","offset":774},{"uri":"Extravehicular_Activity","surface_form":"EVAs","offset":785},{"uri":"Apollo_15","surface_form":"Apollo 15","offset":861},{"uri":"Lunar_Roving_Vehicle","surface_form":"drive on the Moon","offset":984}]}
