{"id":585785,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che%C5%82mno_extermination_camp","text":"e=\"preserve\">Che\u0142mno extermination camp () was the first extermination camp (death camp) opened by Nazi Germany. It was 50 kilometres (31\u00A0mi) north of the city of \u0141\u00F3d\u017A, Poland. In 1939, Nazi Germany had invaded Poland, and had annexed (took control of) parts of Poland.\nThe Nazis built Che\u0142mno with the specific goal of carrying out ethnic cleansing through mass murder. The Nazis kept Che\u0142mno open from, as part of Operation Reinhard during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust, and again from to during the Soviet counter-offensive.\nThe Nazis murdered over 150,000 people at Che\u0142mno, including many Polish Jews from the \u0141\u00F3d\u017A Ghetto and the local people who lived in \"Reichsgau Wartheland\" (\"Warthegau\").\nVictims.\nThe Nazis killed at least 152,000 people at Che\u0142mno. Nazi officials were eventually charged with killing at least 180,000 victims.\nThe Kulmhof Museum of Martyrdom (pl)says that around 200,000 people were killed at Che\u0142mno.\nThe Nazis killed these victims using gas vans. They forced the victims into large vans, and then pumped carbon monoxide into the vans to suffocate and kill the victims.\nEarly on, the Nazis experimented at Che\u0142mno. They developed methods which they used later during The Holocaust in Nazi-controlled Poland.\nDestruction.\nRussian soldiers captured the town of Che\u0142mno on. By then, the Nazis had already destroyed evidence that the Che\u0142mno camp ever existed. They left no prisoners behind. One of the camp's survivors, who was fifteen years old at the time, said that only three Jewish males had escaped successfully from Che\u0142mno.\nIn 1961, the three best-known survivors testified about Che\u0142mno at Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem. In 1962-1965, two survivors also testified at trials held in West Germany against people who worked at the camp.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nazi_concentration_camps","surface_form":"extermination camp (death camp)","offset":57},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":99},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":123},{"uri":"%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA","surface_form":"\u0141\u00F3d\u017A","offset":163},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":169},{"uri":"Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)","surface_form":"invaded Poland","offset":203},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"annexed","offset":227},{"uri":"Ethnic_cleansing","surface_form":"ethnic cleansing","offset":333},{"uri":"Mass_murder","surface_form":"mass murder","offset":358},{"uri":"Operation_Reinhard","surface_form":"Operation Reinhard","offset":416},{"uri":"The_Holocaust","surface_form":"the Holocaust","offset":467},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":511},{"uri":"Polish_Jews","surface_form":"Polish Jews","offset":603},{"uri":"%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Ghetto","surface_form":"\u0141\u00F3d\u017A Ghetto","offset":624},{"uri":"Muzeum_by%C5%82ego_Obozu_Zag%C5%82ady_w_Che%C5%82mnie_nad_Nerem","surface_form":"(pl)","offset":880},{"uri":"Gas_van","surface_form":"gas van","offset":977},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"carbon monoxide","offset":1044},{"uri":"Asphyxia","surface_form":"suffocate","offset":1077},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":1351},{"uri":"Adolf_Eichmann","surface_form":"Adolf Eichmann","offset":1635},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":1661},{"uri":"West_Germany","surface_form":"West Germany","offset":1733}]}
