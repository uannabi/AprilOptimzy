It is the busiest line on the \"L\" system, with an average of 251,813 passengers boarding each weekday in 2012. The route is long with a total of 33 stations, from Howard station in Rogers Park on the north side, through the State Street subway and to 95th/Dan Ryan in Roseland on the south side.\nLike the Blue Line, the Red Line runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; it is one of only five mass-transit rail systems in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, Staten Island Railway, the PATH lines, and the New York City Subway).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rapid_transit","surface_form":"rapid transit","offset":88},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":110},{"uri":"Chicago_Transit_Authority","surface_form":"Chicago Transit Authority","offset":130},{"uri":"Chicago_%26quot%3BL%26quot%3B","surface_form":"Chicago \"L\"","offset":177},{"uri":"Rogers_Park%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Rogers Park","offset":378},{"uri":"Roseland%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Roseland","offset":465},{"uri":"Blue_Line_(CTA)","surface_form":"Blue Line","offset":502},{"uri":"PATCO_Speedline","surface_form":"PATCO Speedline","offset":665},{"uri":"Staten_Island_Railway","surface_form":"Staten Island Railway","offset":682},{"uri":"PATH_(rail_system)","surface_form":"PATH","offset":709},{"uri":"New_York_City_Subway","surface_form":"New York City Subway","offset":729}]}
