They are used to support paper with one hand, while writing on the paper with the other hand. Clipboards are often used in situations where a person may not be able to find a good writing surface.\nClipboards can be made of many things. Most clipboards are made of masonite or particleboard, two types of wood. They can also be made from aluminum, steel, or acrylic, which is a type of plastic.\nPolice and EMT clipboards.\nMany police officers and EMTs carry clipboards. These clipboards are used very often and are usually made of metal. They often have one or two sections inside for carrying papers and reports.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":121},{"uri":"Masonite","surface_form":"masonite","offset":392},{"uri":"Particleboard","surface_form":"particleboard","offset":404},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":432},{"uri":"Acrylic","surface_form":"acrylic","offset":485},{"uri":"Police_officer","surface_form":"police officer","offset":554},{"uri":"Emergency_Medical_Technician","surface_form":"EMT","offset":574}]}
