He was best known for his 1974 book, \"Birth Without Violence\", which popularized gentle birthing techniques, in particular, the practice of immersing newborn infants in a small tub of warm water. This method is known as a \"Leboyer bath\".\nLeboyer also advocated low lighting and noise in a warm room to limit the supposed shock of birth, and that a newborn be laid on its mother's stomach and allowed to bond, instead of being taken away for tests.\nLeboyer died on May 25, 2017 in Paris, at the age of 98.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":58},{"uri":"Obstetrics","surface_form":"obstetrician","offset":65},{"uri":"Birth_Without_Violence","surface_form":"Birth Without Violence","offset":128},{"uri":"Childbirth","surface_form":"birthing","offset":178},{"uri":"Infant","surface_form":"infant","offset":248},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":570}]}
