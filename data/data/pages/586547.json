{"id":586547,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andersonville_National_Historic_Site","text":"The Andersonville National Historic Site is the site of the American Civil War prisoner of war camp Camp Sumter (also known as Andersonville Prison). Andersonville was a Confederate prisoner-of-war-camp during the last 12 months of the Civil War.\nThe site is near Andersonville, Georgia. Most of the site lies in southwestern Macon County. Along with the former prisoner, the Andersonville National Cemetery and the National Prisoner of War Museum are also at the Andersonville National Historic Site.\n12,920 Union Army prisoners died. This was over one out of every four prisoners at Andersonville.\nThe camp was overcrowded with four times as many prisoners as it was designed to hold. There was not enough water, food, or sanitation. About 45,000 Union prisoners were held at Camp Sumter during the war; nearly 13,000 (nearly 3 in every 10) died. The most common causes of death were scurvy, diarrhea, and dysentery.\nDuring the Civil War, Confederate Captain Henry Wirz ran Andersonville. After the war, he was tried and found guilty of war crimes and executed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":60},{"uri":"Prisoner_of_war","surface_form":"prisoner of war","offset":79},{"uri":"Confederate_States_of_America","surface_form":"Confederate","offset":170},{"uri":"Andersonville%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Andersonville","offset":264},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":279},{"uri":"Macon_County%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Macon County","offset":326},{"uri":"Union_Army","surface_form":"Union Army","offset":509},{"uri":"Union_Army","surface_form":"Union","offset":749},{"uri":"Scurvy","surface_form":"scurvy","offset":886},{"uri":"Diarrhea","surface_form":"diarrhea","offset":894},{"uri":"Dysentery","surface_form":"dysentery","offset":908},{"uri":"Henry_Wirz","surface_form":"Henry Wirz","offset":961},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"tried","offset":1013},{"uri":"Conviction","surface_form":"found guilty","offset":1023},{"uri":"War_crime","surface_form":"war crime","offset":1039},{"uri":"Execution","surface_form":"executed","offset":1054}]}
