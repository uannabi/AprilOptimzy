{"id":586907,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys%27_Life","text":"\"Boys' Life\" is a magazine made by the Boy Scouts of America. It was first published in 1911.\nThere are two versions of \"Boys' Life\". The first version is made for the youngest members of Cub Scouting. These are the 6-to-10-year-old Cub Scouts and first-year Webelos Scouts (a rank in Cub Scouts). The second version is made for 11-to-18-year-old boys, which includes second-year Webelos through 18-year-old Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts and Venturers. The publisher picks which version to send by looking at if the subscriber is in Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts.\nIn June 2007, \"Boys' Life\" earned four Distinguished Achievement Awards from the Association of Educational Publishers (AEP). One of those awards is\u3000Periodical\u3000of the Year.\nThe magazine's mascot is Pedro the Mailburro, who answers readers' letters. Boys' Life has a comic strip about Pedro.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":18},{"uri":"Boy_Scouts_of_America","surface_form":"Boy Scouts of America","offset":39},{"uri":"Edition","surface_form":"versions","offset":108},{"uri":"Cub_Scouting_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)","surface_form":"Cub Scouting","offset":188},{"uri":"Varsity_Scouting_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)","surface_form":"Varsity Scouts","offset":420},{"uri":"Venturing_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)","surface_form":"Venturers","offset":439},{"uri":"Association_of_Educational_Publishers","surface_form":"Association of Educational Publishers","offset":637},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":744},{"uri":"Comic_strip","surface_form":"comic strip","offset":822}]}
