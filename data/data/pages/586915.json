{"id":586915,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_theorem","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a fixed-point theorem is a theorem that a mathematical function has a fixed point. At that fixed point, the function's input and output are equal.\nThis concept is not one theorem itself; it is a way to describe many other theorems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":56},{"uri":"Mathematical_function","surface_form":"mathematical function","offset":71},{"uri":"Fixed_point","surface_form":"fixed point","offset":99}]}
