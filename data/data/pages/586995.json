{"id":586995,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Thun","text":"Lake Thun () is a Alpine lake in the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland named by the city of Thun. It is on the northern shore.\nThe 2,500\u00A0km\u00B2 catchment area often causes local flooding after heavy rainfalls. This occurs because the river Aare, which drains Lake Thun, can only hold some of the extra runoff. The lake is fed by water from Lake Brienz to the southeast, which is 6 metres higher than Lake Thun. It is also fed by various streams in the Oberland, including the Kander.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swiss_Alps","surface_form":"Alpine","offset":18},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":25},{"uri":"Bernese_Oberland","surface_form":"Bernese Oberland","offset":37},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":57},{"uri":"Thun","surface_form":"Thun","offset":90},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"catchment","offset":139},{"uri":"Aar","surface_form":"Aare","offset":235},{"uri":"Lake_Brienz","surface_form":"Lake Brienz","offset":335},{"uri":"Kander_(Switzerland)","surface_form":"Kander","offset":471}]}
