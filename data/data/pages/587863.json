{"id":587863,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mlad%C3%A1_Boleslav","text":"Mlad\u00E1 Boleslav (;) is a city in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It is on the left bank of the Jizera river about northeast of Prague. The automobile company \u0160koda Auto has its main office in Mlad\u00E1 Boleslav.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in the second half of the 10th century by King Boleslav II as a royal castle. Because there already was a castle known as Boleslav near Prague, this new castle was named Mlad\u00E1 (young) to distinguish it from the older Boleslav, which became known in the 15th century as Star\u00E1 Boleslav (Old Boleslav). The town received partial city rights in 1334 and 1436, becoming an important site on the road from Prague to northern Bohemia, Lusatia, and Brandenburg. In the 16th century the town was a leading centre of the Unitas Fratrum / Unity of the Brethren / Moravian Church, hosting the Brethren's bishopp, Renaissance church, and printing house. After being re-Catholicized in the 17th century, the town's population declined.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":24},{"uri":"Central_Bohemian_Region","surface_form":"Central Bohemian Region","offset":36},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":67},{"uri":"Jizera_(river)","surface_form":"Jizera","offset":113},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":145},{"uri":"%C5%A0koda_Auto","surface_form":"\u0160koda Auto","offset":176},{"uri":"Boleslav_II","surface_form":"Boleslav II","offset":303},{"uri":"Star%C3%A1_Boleslav","surface_form":"Star\u00E1 Boleslav","offset":525},{"uri":"Bohemia","surface_form":"Bohemia","offset":675},{"uri":"Lusatia","surface_form":"Lusatia","offset":684},{"uri":"Brandenburg","surface_form":"Brandenburg","offset":697},{"uri":"Moravian_Church","surface_form":"Moravian Church","offset":808},{"uri":"Bishopp","surface_form":"bishopp","offset":848},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":857}]}
