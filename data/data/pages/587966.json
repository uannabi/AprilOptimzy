{"id":587966,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate","text":"e=\"preserve\">Probate is the legal process through which the will of a deceased person is accepted and handled by a court. The probate process includes confirming that the will, paying the deceased person's debts, and distributing the deceased person's money and property as directed by the will. In many jurisdictions the court where probate take place is called a \"probate court\".\nFor people who die without much money or property, many jurisdictions allow simplified probate proceedings that are cheaper and easier to carry out.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Will_(law)","surface_form":"will","offset":60},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdictions","offset":304}]}
