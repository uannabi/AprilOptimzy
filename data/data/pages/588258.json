{"id":588258,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niuean_language","text":"=\"preserve\">Niuean (Niuean: \"ko e vagahau Niu\u0113\") is a Polynesian language spoken by about 8,000 people, the majority of whom live in New Zealand. There are also Niuean speakers in Niue, where almost the entire population of about 2,000 speak the language, the Cook Islands and Tonga. The closest relative of Niuean is Tongan, while M\u0101ori, S\u0101moan, and Hawaiian are also quite close.\nThe alphabet was written in the 19th century by Christian missionaries, being influenced by the Samoan writing system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polynesian_languages","surface_form":"Polynesian","offset":54},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":133},{"uri":"Niue","surface_form":"Niue","offset":180},{"uri":"Cook_Islands","surface_form":"Cook Islands","offset":260},{"uri":"Tonga","surface_form":"Tonga","offset":277},{"uri":"Tongan_language","surface_form":"Tongan","offset":318},{"uri":"Maori_language","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":332},{"uri":"Samoan_language","surface_form":"S\u0101moan","offset":339},{"uri":"Hawaiian_language","surface_form":"Hawaiian","offset":351},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":430}]}
