{"id":588392,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Warmbier","text":"Otto Frederick Warmbier (; December 12, 1994\u00A0\u2013 June 19, 2017) was an American college student. He was imprisoned in North Korea from March 2016 to June 2017 after being convicted of \"hostile acts\" against the country.\nImprisonment.\nWarmbier, then 21 years old, confessed to stealing a political propaganda poster from a hotel and was sentenced to 15 years' hard labor. The United States made diplomatic efforts to seek Warmbier's release. A U.S. State Department spokesman said Warmbier's harsh sentence was a response to U.S. sanctions against North Korea for its nuclear activities. According to his father, Warmbier's confession was forced and he was abducted by the North Korean government for political purposes.\nRelease.\nWarmbier fell into a coma in North Korea and was released in June 2017, after nearly 18 months in North Korea. According to North Korean authorities, Warmbier's coma was a result of botulism and a sleeping pill, but U.S. physicians cast doubt on that claim. Warmbier arrived in Cincinnati on June 13 and was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center for immediate evaluation and treatment. He was diagnosed with \"severe neurological injury.\"\nHis father believes that he was \"terrorized and brutalized\".\nDeath.\nWarmbier died on June 19, 2017 in Cincinnati, six days after his return to the United States from complications of cardiopulmonary arrest caused by botulism and sepsis. He was also suffering from pneumonia and kidney failure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":116},{"uri":"Propaganda_in_North_Korea","surface_form":"political propaganda poster","offset":285},{"uri":"U.S._State_Department","surface_form":"U.S. State Department","offset":441},{"uri":"Botulism","surface_form":"botulism","offset":909},{"uri":"Cincinnati","surface_form":"Cincinnati","offset":1005},{"uri":"University_of_Cincinnati_Medical_Center","surface_form":"University of Cincinnati Medical Center","offset":1044},{"uri":"Cardiopulmonary_arrest","surface_form":"cardiopulmonary arrest","offset":1359},{"uri":"Botulism","surface_form":"botulism","offset":1392},{"uri":"Sepsis","surface_form":"sepsis","offset":1405},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":1440},{"uri":"Kidney_failure","surface_form":"kidney failure","offset":1454}]}
