{"id":588802,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction","text":"A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain caused from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain.\nThe lack of oxygen due to the low blood supply causes an ischemic stroke that can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time. The blockage can be due to a thrombus, an embolus or an atheromatous stenosis of one or more arteries.\nWhich arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected (infarcted). These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Necrosis","surface_form":"necrotic","offset":36},{"uri":"Human_brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":59},{"uri":"Brain_ischemia","surface_form":"blockage or narrowing","offset":79},{"uri":"Cerebral_circulation","surface_form":"arteries","offset":108},{"uri":"Cerebral_hypoxia","surface_form":"lack of oxygen","offset":162},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"ischemic stroke","offset":215},{"uri":"Thrombus","surface_form":"thrombus","offset":369},{"uri":"Embolus","surface_form":"embolus","offset":382},{"uri":"Atheromatous","surface_form":"atheromatous","offset":396},{"uri":"Stenosis","surface_form":"stenosis","offset":409},{"uri":"Artery","surface_form":"arteries","offset":433}]}
