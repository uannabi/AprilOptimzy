{"id":589109,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, Euler-Mascheroni constant is a number that appears in analysis and number theory. It first appeared in the work of Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the early 18th century. It is usually represented with the Greek letter formula_1 (gamma), although Euler used the letters C and O instead.\nIt is not known yet whether the number is irrational (that is, cannot be written as a fraction with an integer numerator and denominator) or transcendental (that is, cannot be the solution of a polynomial with integer coefficients). The numerical value of formula_1 is about formula_1. Italian mathematician Lorenzo Mascheroni also worked with the number, and tried unsuccessfully to approximate the number to 32 decimal places, making mistakes on five digits.\nIt can also be written as an improper integral involving the floor function, a function which outputs the greatest integer less than or equal to a given number.\nThe gamma constant is closely linked to the Gamma function, specifically its logarithmic derivative, the digamma function, which is defined as\nFor formula_1, this gives\nUsing properties of the digamma function, formula_1 can also be written as a limit.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":83},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":96},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonhard Euler","offset":164},{"uri":"Gamma","surface_form":"gamma","offset":265},{"uri":"Irrational_number","surface_form":"irrational","offset":364},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fraction","offset":408},{"uri":"Transcendental_number","surface_form":"transcendental","offset":463},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":516},{"uri":"Lorenzo_Mascheroni","surface_form":"Lorenzo Mascheroni","offset":630},{"uri":"Floor_function","surface_form":"floor function","offset":844},{"uri":"Gamma_function","surface_form":"Gamma function","offset":988},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"derivative","offset":1033},{"uri":"Digamma_function","surface_form":"digamma function","offset":1049}]}
