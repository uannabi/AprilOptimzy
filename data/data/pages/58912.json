{"id":58912,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)","text":"The French National Assembly (\"French\": Assembl\u00E9e nationale'\") is one of the two houses of the Parliament of France under the Fifth Republic. The other is the Senate (\"S\u00E9nat\").\nThe National Assembly consists of 577 members known as \"d\u00E9put\u00E9s\" (deputies), each elected by a single-member constituency. Deputies are elected in each constituency through a two-rounds system. It is presided over by a president normally from the largest party represented, assisted by vice-presidents from across the represented political spectrum. The term of the National Assembly is five years; however, the President of France may dissolve the Assembly (by i.e.: calling a new election), unless he dissolved it in the preceding year.\nThe official seat of the National Assembly is the Palais Bourbon on the left bank of the river Seine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":4},{"uri":"Parliament_of_France","surface_form":"Parliament of France","offset":95},{"uri":"French_Fifth_Republic","surface_form":"Fifth Republic","offset":126},{"uri":"French_Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":159},{"uri":"Constituency","surface_form":"constituency","offset":286},{"uri":"Two-round_system","surface_form":"two-rounds system","offset":352},{"uri":"President_of_France","surface_form":"President of France","offset":589},{"uri":"Palais_Bourbon","surface_form":"Palais Bourbon","offset":766},{"uri":"Seine","surface_form":"Seine","offset":811}]}
