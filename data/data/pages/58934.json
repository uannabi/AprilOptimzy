{"id":58934,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza","text":"Baruch Spinoza (24 November 1632 in Amsterdam \u2013 21 February 1677 in The Hague) was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Jewish origin. He is considered to be one of the great Rationalist philosophers of the 17th century. Other famous rationalists include Gottfried Leibniz and Ren\u00E9 Descartes.\nLife.\nSpinoza's ideas were not cherished by the Jewish community in Amsterdam of the time, and Spinoza was excommunicated in 1656.\nKey ideas.\nAn important idea in Spinoza's philosophy is God and Nature (everything that exists) are the same thing. Opposing Dualism, Spinoza said that the body and the mind (soul) are two of God's infinite attributes.\nThere is no good or evil in Nature, and that these words only have meanings for human beings. For a person, an event that leads to happiness is good, and an event that leads to suffering is bad.\nThe goal of every person is to intellectually love God (that is, understand Nature as much as humanly possible).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1632","surface_form":"1632","offset":28},{"uri":"Amsterdam","surface_form":"Amsterdam","offset":36},{"uri":"1677","surface_form":"1677","offset":60},{"uri":"The_Hague","surface_form":"The Hague","offset":68},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":85},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":91},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":106},{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":117},{"uri":"Rationalism","surface_form":"Rationalist","offset":172},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":204},{"uri":"Gottfried_Leibniz","surface_form":"Gottfried Leibniz","offset":252},{"uri":"Ren%C3%A9_Descartes","surface_form":"Ren\u00E9 Descartes","offset":274},{"uri":"Amsterdam","surface_form":"Amsterdam","offset":358},{"uri":"Excommunication","surface_form":"excommunicated","offset":397},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":477},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"Nature","offset":485},{"uri":"Pantheism","surface_form":"everything that exists","offset":493},{"uri":"Dualism","surface_form":"Dualism","offset":546},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":590},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"soul","offset":596},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":619},{"uri":"Good_(philosophy)","surface_form":"good","offset":652},{"uri":"Evil","surface_form":"evil","offset":660},{"uri":"Human_beings","surface_form":"human beings","offset":720},{"uri":"Happiness","surface_form":"happiness","offset":771}]}
