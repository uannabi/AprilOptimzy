{"id":58960,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waits","text":"Waits or waites were British town musicians. From medieval times up to the early 19th century, every important British town and city had a band of waites. Some other countries in Europe also had waits. They were called Stadtpfeifer in Germany and Pifferi in Italy.\nThe duties (things they had to do) varied in different towns and at different times in history. One of their most important jobs was to play at certain times of day so that people knew what the time was. They often played from the top of church towers. Sometimes they were also guards, watching from the towers so that they could spot any danger. They were like watchmen, making sure everything was all right (there was no police at that time). They woke people up in the mornings by playing music in the streets.\nThe instruments they played also varied. Mostly they were loud wind instruments such as the shawm. It was a paid job. The waits wore smart liveries and silver chains of office with the town's arms.\nIn Germany the Stadtpfeifer would also play at church services. They would play shawms or trombones on normal days, but trumpets and drums on feast-days.\nIn Britain there were no more waits after 1835. The name \u201Cwaits\u201D is still used in \u201CChristmas Waits\u201D (any group of people singing carols at Christmas).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":21},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":50},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":111},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":179},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":235},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":258},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":688},{"uri":"Wind_instrument","surface_form":"wind instrument","offset":842},{"uri":"Shawm","surface_form":"shawm","offset":871},{"uri":"Livery","surface_form":"liveries","offset":918},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"arms","offset":971},{"uri":"Church_service","surface_form":"church services","offset":1024},{"uri":"Trombone","surface_form":"trombones","offset":1067},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpets","offset":1097},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drums","offset":1110},{"uri":"1835","surface_form":"1835","offset":1173},{"uri":"Christmas_carol","surface_form":"carols","offset":1260},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":1270}]}
