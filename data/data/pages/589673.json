{"id":589673,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant","text":"A cochlear implant (CI) is an electronic device that is inserted by surgery into a part of the ear called cochlea. Persons who are having difficulty in hearing or are completely deaf use the device to help them hear better. Not all parts of the cochlear implants are inside the ear. They have a microphone and some electronics that are usually placed behind the ear. These electronics send signals to the device implanted in the ear to make hearing possible.\nInternal.\nImplanting the device requires proper care and skill. The person on which the device will be implanted will be anesthetized. There are risks, a person may experience mastoiditis or otitis media, the facial nerve or chorda tympani maybe damaged and the implanted device could shift. Wound infections may also occur. After the implant, people may become dizzy and have problems balancing for a few months.\nThe total cost of a cochlear implant in the United States was about $100,000 in 2017. Health insurance sometimes pays for all or part of the cost of cochlear implants. The national health insurance schemes in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, Spain, and Israel pay fully for the costs of cochlear implants. The Ministry of Health in New Zealand pays the for the new cochlear implant depending on the cause of deafness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cochlea","surface_form":"cochlea","offset":106},{"uri":"Microphone","surface_form":"microphone","offset":295},{"uri":"Anesthesia","surface_form":"anesthetized","offset":580},{"uri":"Mastoiditis","surface_form":"mastoiditis","offset":635},{"uri":"Otitis_media","surface_form":"otitis media","offset":650},{"uri":"Chorda_tympani","surface_form":"chorda tympani","offset":684}]}
