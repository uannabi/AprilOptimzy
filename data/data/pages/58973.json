{"id":58973,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams","text":"Samuel Adams (September 27 (OS), 1722\u2013October 2, 1803) was an American leader, politician, writer, and political philosopher, and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Adams helped gather support in the American colonies to rebel against Great Britain. This led to the American Revolution. Adams shaped the foundations of American politics.\nAdams, born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, was brought up in a religious family. He was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard College. He started his life as a businessman, but did not like his occupation. He then turned his interest to politics, and became an influential political writer. Adams urged the colonists to withdraw from Great Britain and form a new government. He told the colonies to defend their rights and liberties at town meetings in Boston. He wrote protests against Parliament's taxes against the colonies, such as the Stamp Act of 1765. Adams also organized the Boston Tea Party in 1773 and he was a member of the Continental Congress. He argued for the Declaration of Independence at the Second Continental Congress in 1776.\nAdams helped write the Massachusetts Constitution with James Bowdoin and his cousin John Adams. Later, Adams helped draft the Articles of Confederation. After the Revolutionary War ended, he ran for the House of Representatives in the 1st United States Congressional election. He lost the election to Fisher Ames. He was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts in 1789. After John Hancock's death in 1793, Adams served as the acting governor. He was then elected governor in January of 1794. He served in that position until June 1797. He then retired from politics and settled in his home in Boston. He died six years later on October 2, 1803.\nFurther reading.\nMany of the foremost works on Adams' life are from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Much of the information in more recent biographies is attributed to these earlier works.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_27","surface_form":"September 27","offset":14},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"OS","offset":28},{"uri":"1722","surface_form":"1722","offset":33},{"uri":"October_2","surface_form":"October 2","offset":38},{"uri":"1803","surface_form":"1803","offset":49},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":62},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":79},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":91},{"uri":"Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Founding Fathers of the United States","offset":141},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":250},{"uri":"American_Revolution","surface_form":"American Revolution","offset":281},{"uri":"Boston%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Boston, Massachusetts","offset":379},{"uri":"Harvard","surface_form":"Harvard","offset":483},{"uri":"Stamp_Act","surface_form":"Stamp Act","offset":905},{"uri":"Boston_Tea_Party","surface_form":"Boston Tea Party","offset":949},{"uri":"1773","surface_form":"1773","offset":969},{"uri":"Continental_Congress","surface_form":"Continental Congress","offset":1001},{"uri":"United_States_Declaration_of_Independence","surface_form":"Declaration of Independence","offset":1041},{"uri":"1776","surface_form":"1776","offset":1107},{"uri":"John_Adams","surface_form":"John Adams","offset":1197},{"uri":"Articles_of_Confederation","surface_form":"Articles of Confederation","offset":1239},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":1316},{"uri":"Fisher_Ames","surface_form":"Fisher Ames","offset":1414},{"uri":"1789","surface_form":"1789","offset":1482},{"uri":"1793","surface_form":"1793","offset":1518},{"uri":"1794","surface_form":"1794","offset":1604},{"uri":"1797","surface_form":"1797","offset":1648},{"uri":"October_2","surface_form":"October 2","offset":1746},{"uri":"1803","surface_form":"1803","offset":1757}]}
