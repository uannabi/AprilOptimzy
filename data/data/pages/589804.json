He was the first president of Senegal (1960\u201380). He was part of the N\u00E9gritude movement. Some people called him an African socialist, but many Senegalese socialists thought he was not really socialist because he was supported by France and put communists in Senegal in jail. He also started the Senegalese Democratic Bloc party.\nSenghor was the first African allowed to join the \"Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise\". Many people think he is one of the most important intellectuals from Africa during the 20th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":64},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":75},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":146},{"uri":"N%C3%A9gritude","surface_form":"N\u00E9gritude","offset":184},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"African socialist","offset":230},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":344},{"uri":"Communists","surface_form":"communists","offset":359},{"uri":"Jail","surface_form":"jail","offset":384},{"uri":"Senegalese_Democratic_Bloc","surface_form":"Senegalese Democratic Bloc","offset":410},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise","offset":495},{"uri":"Intellectual","surface_form":"intellectuals","offset":566},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":603}]}
