{"id":58983,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart","text":"A pie chart is a type of chart with the shape of a pie or circle. It presents the relationship of different parts of the data. One would easily see the biggest or smallest share of the total data, by simply looking at the pie chart.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known pie charts were in William Playfair's \"Statistical Breviary\" of 1801, in which two are used.\nThis invention was not widely used at first. The French engineer Charles Joseph Minard was one of the first to use it. In 1858 he used them in maps to add information in a third dimension.\nSome have said that Florence Nightingale invented it, but they were ignorant of Playfair's creation.\nNightingale was one of the first to use graphics to get important statistics to the reading public.\nThe polar area diagram is similar to a usual pie chart, except sectors are equal angles and differ rather in how far each sector extends from the center of the circle.\nThe polar area diagram is used to plot cyclic phenomena (e.g., count of deaths by month).\nFor example, if the count of deaths in each month for a year are to be plotted then there will be 12 sectors (one per month) all with the same angle of 30 degrees each. The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month.\nIf the death count in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar area diagram used by Nightingale.\nLimitations.\nPie charts are not the most accurate way to show data: that has been known for some time. Pie charts should be used only when the sum of all categories is meaningful, for example if they represent proportions.\nPie charts are rare in scientific writing. They are more common in business and economics. One reason for this may be that it is more difficult to compare the size of items in a chart when area is used instead of length. Stevens' power law says that it is harder to see small differences using visual area than when using length. This means that length is a better scale to use, because differences can be seen more easily.\nThis can be shown with the image to the right. The pie chart and the bar chart have the same data. Most people have difficulty putting the slices in the pie chart in order by size from biggest to smallest. When using the bar chart, it is much easier to tell the difference between bars that are very similar in size.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chart","surface_form":"chart","offset":25},{"uri":"Pie","surface_form":"pie","offset":51},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":58},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":82},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"data","offset":121},{"uri":"William_Playfair","surface_form":"William Playfair","offset":280},{"uri":"Charles_Joseph_Minard","surface_form":"Charles Joseph Minard","offset":419},{"uri":"Florence_Nightingale","surface_form":"Florence Nightingale","offset":563},{"uri":"Proportion","surface_form":"proportion","offset":1734},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific","offset":1770},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":1814},{"uri":"Economic","surface_form":"economic","offset":1827},{"uri":"Stevens%27_power_law","surface_form":"Stevens' power law","offset":1968}]}
