{"id":5899,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate","text":"Examples of vertebrates are mammals, birds, and fish. A few tens of thousands of species have been identified. The term \"fish\" is used to describe at least four different kinds of vertebrates.\nDistinctions.\nVertebrates dominate amongst the animals in virtually all environments. They include the largest animals in each main ecosystem, though not the largest living things (because that would include trees). They are the only animals which have an adaptive immune system. These two facts may be connected.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":28},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":37},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":48},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":81},{"uri":"Environments","surface_form":"environments","offset":265},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":325},{"uri":"Adaptive_immune_system","surface_form":"adaptive immune system","offset":449}]}
