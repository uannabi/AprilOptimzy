He was born in Mexico City.\nCuevas was one of the first to challenge the then dominant Mexican muralism movement as a member of the Generaci\u00F3n de la Ruptura (Breakaway Generation). He was a mostly self-taught artist, whose styles and influences are moored to the darker side of life, often depicting distorted figures and the debasement of humanity. He had remained a controversial figure throughout his career, not only for his often shocking images, but also for his opposition to writers and artists who he feels participate in corruption or create only for money.\nIn 1992, the Jos\u00E9 Luis Cuevas Museum was opened in the historic center of Mexico City holding most of his work and his personal art collection.\nCuevas died on July 3, 2017 in Mexico City at the age of 83.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mexico_City","surface_form":"Mexico City","offset":89},{"uri":"Mexican_muralism","surface_form":"Mexican muralism","offset":161},{"uri":"Generaci%C3%B3n_de_la_Ruptura","surface_form":"Generaci\u00F3n de la Ruptura","offset":206},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Cuevas_Museum","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Luis Cuevas Museum","offset":655},{"uri":"Historic_center_of_Mexico_City","surface_form":"historic center of Mexico City","offset":697}]}
