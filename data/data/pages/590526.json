{"id":590526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_from_the_psychoanalysis_of_Knut_Hamsun","text":"During the psychoanalysis of Knut Hamsun, notes were made by his psychoanalyst, Johannes Irgens Str\u00F8mme; sometimes the notes are referred to as the Str\u00F8mme/Hamsun manuscript (Norwegian: Str\u00F8mme/Hamsun-manuset).\nHamsun died in 1952 and copies of the notes were published in 2017; the publication is controversial (as of 2017).\nThe existence of the notes led to a race between a group related to [the community of persons who do] research [for a living,] and a group related to publishing.\nDanish author Thorkild Hansen has said that the notes must certainly be viewed as [an] extremely important source.\nMedia sometimes refers to (as of May 2017,) the notes as \"the classified notes\".\nDescription.\nThe notes consist of 474 pages.\nThe notes were written in one version of shorthand, called Gabelsberger.\nPsychoanalysis; non-voluntary psychiatry during the Legal purge in Norway after World War II.\nIn 1925, Hamsun had writer's block, and \"he could not write a sentence\". To go to consultations, at a specialist of psychoanalysis [was a voluntary decision by Hamsun]; he went to Johannes Irgens Str\u00F8mme() - who had been a student of Oskar Pfister()\nDuring a two year period, Hamsun made visits to Str\u00F8mme; Hamsun would lie on a divan [or a couch-like sitting furniture] while being psychoanalyzed, and Str\u00F8mme would sit (on a chair) behind Hamsun.\nIn 1926 the writer's block eased, and the year after he published the novel \"Wayfarers\";\nHe thanked the psychoanalyst \"for the rest of Hamsun's life\", for getting back his apetite for writing.\nNon-voluntary psychiatry.\nDuring the Legal purge in Norway after World War II()\n, Hamsun was examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist - without Hamsun giving permission for the examinations;\n[part of the diagnosis] of Hamsun said that he had [a permanent reduction of sanity] \"varig svekkede sjelsevner\";\nto disprove and discredit the diagnosis, Hamsun wrote \"On Overgrown Paths\"() (published in 1949);\nStorage of the notes.\nThe notes by psychoanalyst Str\u00F8mme, were [years later] \"left to\" a friend (of the psychoanalyst) - \u00D8rnulf Myklestad; this friend was also the publisher of works by the psychoanalyst;\nOn a document dated 1958, Myklestad wrote that he would not do anything while Hamsun's widow was alive;\nthe notes were put in safe deposit box (at a bank);\nOut of the safe deposit box, the notes came in the autumn of 1978;\nThe daughter of psychoanalyst Str\u00F8mme had the shorthand notes, transferred to her.\nInterpreting and transcribing the notes.\nThe stenographied notes were [borrowed] by [publishing house] Gyldendal() for more than two months; Gyldendal returned the notes [together with a letter dated] 18 January 1979; \"with the help of a stenographer employed by Norway's parliament\", Gyldendal was able to interpret 30 pages of the shorthand notes, and Gyldendal transcribed those (in 1979); [in the letter, the female stenographer said that more] deciphering could be achieved - but it probably would take years and it would be expensive.\nAttempts at publication (of psychoanalysis).\nThe interest in the notes regarding Hamsun, reached a climax [or top point] in 2001, when several groups [of people] wanted to use the notes.\nA letter was sent - sometime before 2 April 2001 - from the national library, to the Ministry of Justice, regarding the library's [idea] to publicize the [notes regarding the] psychoanalysis ([that was] performed by Str\u00F8mme); the notes were to be publicized together with comments from literary scientists and psychoanalysts; the project was to be led by Atle Kittang() - an expert (on research regarding Hamsun) and a professor of literature.\nMedia wrote about the letter; psychiatrist Sigmund Karterud() said (on 2 July) that psychiatrists [as a group] are shocked; However, the spokesman for the Hamsun family - Leif Hamsun (a grandchild of Knut Hamsun) - said that the project was not problematic.\nProject by publishing house Gyldendal; the stopping of a project by \"the national library\".\nAt the same time, a major project was started by Gyldendal: Ingar Sletten Kolloen() was [expected] to write a significant biography about Hamsun;\na group of people were put together by Kolloen [to help him]: members of the group included literary scientists and experts of psychoanalysis; the group included psychiatrist Sigmund Karterud();\nThe national library cancelled plans to publish the psychoanalysis notes, media said on 23 September 2001; furthermore, Kolloen was granted access to the psychoanalysis notes, because of Gyldendal's plans for him to write a biography (about Hamsun);\nPublication.\nNotes from Hamsun's psychoanalyst, were published in 2017; the photocopied notes were from [Hamsun's appointments] with his psychoanalyst; the published notes were part of [a work of] art that was published in Vagant()\nThe publication of the psychoanalyst's notes regarding Hamsun, is controversial (as of 2017).\nIn 2017 Morgenbladet() asked \"Why at all, are the notes owned by the public\".\nCurrent possession by \"the national library\"; change of status permitting publication.\nThe notes are deposited (as of 2017) at [\"the national library\" -] Nasjonalbiblioteket in Oslo, Norway;\nthey are part of a package, [that the national library calls] \"manus 4\u00B03565\".\nThe \"national library\" (when it was called \"Universitetsbiblioteket\") received the notes, as a gift from the daughter of psychoanalyst Str\u00F8mme.\nStatus permitting publication.\nIn 1999 the daughter of psychoanalyst Str\u00F8mme, permitted publication of the notes; previously she had put a clause in place that had prevented publication of the notes;\nBy 2003, no one seems to have discovered [and made use of the general availability of the notes].","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychoanalysis","surface_form":"psychoanalysis","offset":11},{"uri":"Knut_Hamsun","surface_form":"Knut Hamsun","offset":29},{"uri":"Psychoanalyst","surface_form":"psychoanalyst","offset":65},{"uri":"Thorkild_Hansen","surface_form":"Thorkild Hansen","offset":502},{"uri":"Classified","surface_form":"classified","offset":665},{"uri":"Shorthand","surface_form":"shorthand","offset":770},{"uri":"Gabelsberger","surface_form":"Gabelsberger","offset":788},{"uri":"Writer%27s_block","surface_form":"writer's block","offset":916},{"uri":"Consultation","surface_form":"consultation","offset":978},{"uri":"Psychoanalysis","surface_form":"psychoanalysis","offset":1012},{"uri":"Johannes_Irgens_Str%C3%B8mme","surface_form":"Johannes Irgens Str\u00F8mme","offset":1076},{"uri":"Oskar_Pfister","surface_form":"Oskar Pfister","offset":1130},{"uri":"Divan","surface_form":"divan","offset":1225},{"uri":"Couch","surface_form":"couch","offset":1237},{"uri":"Wayfarers_(novel)","surface_form":"Wayfarers","offset":1422},{"uri":"Legal_purge_in_Norway_after_World_War_II","surface_form":"Legal purge in Norway after World War II","offset":1575},{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosis","offset":1744},{"uri":"Sanity","surface_form":"sanity","offset":1808},{"uri":"On_Overgrown_Paths","surface_form":"On Overgrown Paths","offset":1900},{"uri":"%C3%98rnulf_Myklestad","surface_form":"\u00D8rnulf Myklestad","offset":2064},{"uri":"Marie_Hamsun","surface_form":"Hamsun's widow","offset":2226},{"uri":"Safe_deposit_box","surface_form":"safe deposit box","offset":2274},{"uri":"Shorthand","surface_form":"shorthand","offset":2417},{"uri":"Stenography","surface_form":"stenographied","offset":2499},{"uri":"Gyldendal_(Norway)","surface_form":"Gyldendal","offset":2557},{"uri":"Stenographer","surface_form":"stenographer","offset":2692},{"uri":"Norway%27s_parliament","surface_form":"Norway's parliament","offset":2717},{"uri":"Shorthand","surface_form":"shorthand","offset":2787},{"uri":"Transcription_(linguistics)","surface_form":"transcribed","offset":2818},{"uri":"Deciphering","surface_form":"deciphering","offset":2903},{"uri":"Climax","surface_form":"climax","offset":3094},{"uri":"Ministry_of_Justice","surface_form":"Ministry of Justice","offset":3267},{"uri":"Literary_scientist","surface_form":"literary scientist","offset":3468},{"uri":"Atle_Kittang","surface_form":"Atle Kittang","offset":3537},{"uri":"Sigmund_Karterud","surface_form":"Sigmund Karterud","offset":3669},{"uri":"Psychiatrist","surface_form":"psychiatrist","offset":3710},{"uri":"Spokesman","surface_form":"spokesman","offset":3763},{"uri":"Grandchild","surface_form":"grandchild","offset":3812},{"uri":"Gyldendal_(Norway)","surface_form":"Gyldendal","offset":4025},{"uri":"Ingar_Sletten_Kolloen","surface_form":"Ingar Sletten Kolloen","offset":4036},{"uri":"Biography","surface_form":"biography","offset":4098},{"uri":"Sigmund_Karterud","surface_form":"Sigmund Karterud","offset":4297},{"uri":"Psychoanalysis","surface_form":"psychoanalyst","offset":4600},{"uri":"Vagant","surface_form":"Vagant","offset":4790},{"uri":"Morgenbladet","surface_form":"Morgenbladet","offset":4901},{"uri":"Nasjonalbiblioteket","surface_form":"Nasjonalbiblioteket","offset":5125},{"uri":"Oslo","surface_form":"Oslo","offset":5148},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":5154},{"uri":"Universitetsbiblioteket","surface_form":"Universitetsbiblioteket","offset":5284},{"uri":"Clause","surface_form":"clause","offset":5523}]}
