{"id":59062,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%27_power_law","text":"Stevens' power law is a proposed relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel.\nMost people think that it describes a wider range of sensations than Weber-Fechner law. But critics argue that the validity of the law is not sure.\nThe theory is named after psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens (1906\u20131973). Although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1956.\nThe general form of the law is\nwhere formula_1 is the magnitude of the physical stimulus, formula_1 is the psychophysical function capturing sensation (the subjective size of the stimulus), formula_1 is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and formula_1 is a proportionality constant that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used.\nThe table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Magnitude_(mathematics)","surface_form":"magnitude","offset":58},{"uri":"Stimulus","surface_form":"stimulus","offset":82},{"uri":"Weber-Fechner_law","surface_form":"Weber-Fechner law","offset":208},{"uri":"Stanley_Smith_Stevens","surface_form":"Stanley Smith Stevens","offset":329},{"uri":"1906","surface_form":"1906","offset":352},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":357},{"uri":"Power_law","surface_form":"power law","offset":387},{"uri":"Proportionality_(mathematics)","surface_form":"proportionality","offset":829}]}
