{"id":590620,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gosch","text":"e=\"preserve\">Johnny Gosch (born November 12, 1969) was a paperboy in West Des Moines, Iowa. He disappeared at age 12, while delivering newspapers. In the early hours of September 5, 1982, he disappeared on his route and was never seen since. Gosch is believed to be kidnapped. His mother got mail one morning in 1997 showing the photos of her kidnapped son and three other boys. Another paperboy disappeared where Johnny was kidnapped, named Eugene Martin, 13 years old.\nHis mother, Noreen Gosch, maintains that Johnny Gosch escaped from his captors and visited her in 1997, but now fears for his life and lives under an assumed identity. Gosch's father, John, divorced from Noreen since 1993, has publicly stated that he was not sure whether or not such a visit actually occurred. Authorities have not located Gosch or confirmed Noreen Gosch's account, and his fate continues to be the subject of speculation, conspiracy theories, and dispute.The case received publicity in 2006 when his mother claimed to have found photographs on her doorstep depicting Gosch in captivity. Some of the photos received were proven to be children from a case in Florida, but one boy in the photos was never identified. Noreen Gosch insists that boy is her son Johnny.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"West_Des_Moines%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"West Des Moines","offset":69},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":86},{"uri":"Kidnapping","surface_form":"kidnapped","offset":266},{"uri":"Conspiracy_theories","surface_form":"conspiracy theories","offset":911}]}
