{"id":590770,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_My_Love_(Eagles_song)","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Best of My Love\" is a soft rock song from the Eagles. The song was part of the studio album \"On the Border\". It was released in November 1974. It was the third single from the album. It was the Eagles' first #1 song on the United States \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It became so in March 1975.\nThe song also topped the easy listening chart for one week in February 1975. The \"Billboard\" Year End Charts ranked \"Best of My Love\" at #12 for 1975. It sold over a million copies.\nThe single edit was shortened by Asylum Records. The record company shortened the single, so that it would be more radio-friendly, without the Eagles' knowledge. This made them angry. Don Henley wanted the single pulled from stores. The full song is four minutes and thirty four seconds.\nWhen the song was judged to have sold over a million copies, Eagles' manager, Irving Azoff, sent a gold record with a piece cut-out to Asylum Records.\nThe song was later remade by the country music group Brooks & Dunn in 1993.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soft_rock","surface_form":"soft rock","offset":36},{"uri":"The_Eagles","surface_form":"the Eagles","offset":56},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":93},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":174},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":237},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":251},{"uri":"Adult_Contemporary","surface_form":"easy listening","offset":325},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":869},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":954},{"uri":"Brooks_%26amp%3B_Dunn","surface_form":"Brooks & Dunn","offset":974}]}
