She has been tattooing headhunters and women of the indigenous people of Butbut in Buscalan Kalinga for more than 80 years, but the Butbut warriors who used to earn tattoos through protecting villages or killing enemies no longer exist.\nInstead, Whang-od now applies the traditional art form to tourists visiting Buscalan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buscalan","surface_form":"Buscalan","offset":72},{"uri":"Tinglayan%2C_Kalinga","surface_form":"Tinglayan","offset":82},{"uri":"Kalinga_(province)","surface_form":"Kalinga","offset":93},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":102},{"uri":"Headhunting","surface_form":"headhunter","offset":302}]}
