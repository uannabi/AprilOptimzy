{"id":590796,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sushi","text":"The history of sushi began when rice farming came to Japan over 2,000 years ago. The original type of sushi was developed in the Nara Prefecture as a way of preserving fish in fermented rice. During the Muromachi period, people would eat the rice \"and\" the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar, not fermented rice, was used. In more recent times, it has become a fast food associated with Japanese culture.\nThe origin of sushi goes back to Southeast Asia around the 4th century B.C.. At that time, it was called \"narezushi\". The fish was originally eaten alone, without rice. Later on, a style of namaranarezushi reached Japan. Namaranerezushi combined the fish with rice.\nWhat is called sushi in modern times was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799\u20131858) at the End of the Edo period. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented. It was prepared quickly. It could be eaten with one's hands. This fish was originally known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in Edo-Bay or Tokyo Bay. The fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay.\nBy the early 1900s, sushi was being served in the United States, after many Japanese people immigrated there. The first United States sushi shop opened up in 1906 in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles.\nIn the United Kingdom, a report of sushi being eaten in Britain happened when then Crown Prince Akihito (born 1933) visited Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\nAustralia is a major source of rice used with sushi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":32},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":53},{"uri":"Sushi","surface_form":"sushi","offset":102},{"uri":"Nara_Prefecture","surface_form":"Nara Prefecture","offset":129},{"uri":"Food_preservation","surface_form":"preserving","offset":157},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":168},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermented","offset":176},{"uri":"Muromachi_period","surface_form":"Muromachi period","offset":203},{"uri":"Edo_period","surface_form":"Edo period","offset":274},{"uri":"Vinegar","surface_form":"vinegar","offset":286},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":363},{"uri":"Japanese_culture","surface_form":"Japanese culture","offset":389},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":450},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1149},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigrated","offset":1191},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1281},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1301},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":1350},{"uri":"Akihito","surface_form":"Akihito","offset":1390},{"uri":"Queen_Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth II","offset":1418},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1446}]}
