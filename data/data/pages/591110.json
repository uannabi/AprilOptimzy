The station is on the Medway Valley Line.\nHistory.\nThe line between Strood and Maidstone, on which New Hythe lies, was completed in 1856. However, no trains went there until 9 December 1929. At that time, New Hythe Halt, a timber-built halt, was opened to serve the huge paper mill which was next to the line. The present station was constructed in 1936. The line was electrified in 1939.\nServices.\nAll train services are provided by Southeastern. The typical off-peak service from New Hythe is two trains per hour to Maidstone West, with alternate trains extended to Paddock Wood and, and two trains an hour to Strood, for connections to London.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":31},{"uri":"New_Hythe","surface_form":"New Hythe","offset":50},{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":61},{"uri":"Medway_Valley_Line","surface_form":"Medway Valley Line","offset":89},{"uri":"Timber-built","surface_form":"timber-built","offset":290},{"uri":"Hal","surface_form":"hal","offset":303},{"uri":"Paper_mill","surface_form":"paper mill","offset":338},{"uri":"Railway_electrification_in_Great_Britain","surface_form":"electrified","offset":435},{"uri":"Southeastern_(train_operating_company)","surface_form":"Southeastern","offset":501},{"uri":"Maidstone_West_railway_station","surface_form":"Maidstone West","offset":585},{"uri":"Paddock_Wood_railway_station","surface_form":"Paddock Wood","offset":635},{"uri":"Strood_railway_station","surface_form":"Strood","offset":679},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":706}]}
