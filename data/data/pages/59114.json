{"id":59114,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_V%C3%ADa","text":"The Gran V\u00EDa (The Great Way) is one of the most important shopping areas in Madrid, Spain. It also has hotels and large movie theaters.\nMany of the buildings on the Gran V\u00EDa are decorated with fancy sculptures. One of the more impressive buildings on the Gran V\u00EDa is the Edificio Metropolis. It was built in 1907 by Jules and Raymond F\u00E9vrier. It has a statue of the winged Roman goddess, Victoria, on the top. Madrid's first skyscraper, Telefonica's Head Office, is also on the Gran V\u00EDa.\nThe Gran V\u00EDa was planned in the 1850s. They did not start building the road until 1904 and finished it in 1929. People laughed at the plan because it took so long to get started. As a joke, they called it the 'gran v\u00EDa' or 'great road'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":76},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":84},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":103},{"uri":"Movie_theater","surface_form":"movie theater","offset":120},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":148},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":199},{"uri":"Jules_F%C3%A9vrier","surface_form":"Jules","offset":316},{"uri":"Raymond_F%C3%A9vrier","surface_form":"Raymond F\u00E9vrier","offset":326},{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statue","offset":352},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":366},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman","offset":373},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"goddess","offset":379},{"uri":"Victoria_(goddess)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":388},{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":425},{"uri":"Telefonica","surface_form":"Telefonica","offset":437},{"uri":"1850s","surface_form":"1850s","offset":520}]}
