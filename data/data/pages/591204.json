{"id":591204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pal%C3%A9zieux","text":"Pal\u00E9zieux is a village and former municipality of the district Broye-Vully in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. Since 2012 it forms part of the municipality of Oron.\nHistory.\nPal\u00E9zieux was first mentioned in 1134 as \"de Palaisol\".\nUnder the rule of Savoy, the family \"de Pal\u00E9zieux\" - mentioned in texts from 1154 - had their castle near the village, of which remains can be seen today (mainly a wall). The castle controlled a bridge on the River Broye, which was a source of profit through the various tolls and taxes.\nThe bridge over the Broye was washed away in 1700, following a flood. It was rebuilt in 1750, following several petitions. Modernized, it is still in place.\nThe creation of the separate settlement at Pal\u00E9zieux-Gare came about with the commissioning of the railway line between Lausanne and Bern in 1862, which was built away from the original village (which became known as Pal\u00E9zieux-Village). In 1876 the line from Payerne was added, which runs adjacent to Pal\u00E9zieux-Village, and in 1903 the metre gauge line leading to the Gruy\u00E8re was constructed, with its terminus at Pal\u00E9zieux-Gare.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":15},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":34},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":54},{"uri":"Broye-Vully_(district)","surface_form":"Broye-Vully","offset":63},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":82},{"uri":"Vaud","surface_form":"Vaud","offset":92},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":100},{"uri":"Oron%2C_Switzerland","surface_form":"Oron","offset":161},{"uri":"Savoy","surface_form":"Savoy","offset":250},{"uri":"Lausanne","surface_form":"Lausanne","offset":797},{"uri":"Bern","surface_form":"Bern","offset":810},{"uri":"Payerne","surface_form":"Payerne","offset":936}]}
