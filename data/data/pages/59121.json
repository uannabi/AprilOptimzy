It is located in Madrid, Spain. It is one of the largest palaces in western Europe.\nKing Felipe V had the palace built to replace the Alcazar that was burned down. It is made of limestone and granite. It was supposed to look a little like the Palace of Versailles in France. Juan Bautista Sachetti was in charge of building the palace. They started to build it in 1738. Carlos III moved into the palace in 1764. It took a hundred years to decorate all the rooms.\nSpanish kings lived there until 1931 when King Alfonso XIII was forced to leave Spain. The Royal Palace is still used for special ceremonies. Letizia was supposed to walk on a red carpet from the Royal Palace to the cathedral for the wedding with Prince Felipe but it rained so she was taken in car.\nFifty of the rooms in the palace are open for public visits. Visitors enter the palace from the Plaza de la Armer\u00EDa. Some of the rooms that can be seen are: the 'porcelain' room, 'throne' room and 'clock' room. There is a royal army museum in the palace.\nLocation.\nThe Almudena Cathedral is nearby the palace.\nThe Royal Alcazar of Madrid was originally on the site.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_of_Spain","surface_form":"King of Spain","offset":80},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":112},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":120},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":171},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":179},{"uri":"Felipe_V_of_Spain","surface_form":"Felipe V","offset":184},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":201},{"uri":"Alcazar","surface_form":"Alcazar","offset":229},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":273},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":287},{"uri":"Palace_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Palace of Versailles","offset":338},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":362},{"uri":"Juan_Bautista_Sachetti","surface_form":"Juan Bautista Sachetti","offset":370},{"uri":"King_Carlos_III_of_Spain","surface_form":"Carlos III","offset":465},{"uri":"Alfonso_XIII_of_Spain","surface_form":"Alfonso XIII","offset":605},{"uri":"Letizia%2C_Princess_of_Asturias","surface_form":"Letizia","offset":700},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":734},{"uri":"Carpet","surface_form":"carpet","offset":738},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":774},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":792},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"Prince","offset":805},{"uri":"Felipe%2C_Prince_of_Asturias","surface_form":"Felipe","offset":812},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":826},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":853},{"uri":"Public","surface_form":"public","offset":904},{"uri":"Plaza_de_la_Armer%C3%ADa","surface_form":"Plaza de la Armer\u00EDa","offset":954},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":1020},{"uri":"Throne","surface_form":"throne","offset":1038},{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clock","offset":1056},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":1086},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":1091},{"uri":"Almudena_Cathedral","surface_form":"Almudena Cathedral","offset":1127},{"uri":"Royal_Alcazar_of_Madrid","surface_form":"Royal Alcazar of Madrid","offset":1172}]}
