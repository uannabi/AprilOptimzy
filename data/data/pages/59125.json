{"id":59125,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza","text":"Plaza is a Spanish word related to \"field\" which describes an open public space in a city, such as a city square. In Spanish America, the plaza mayor of each city had three things: the cathedral, the \"cabildo\" or administrative center, and the \"audiencia\" or law court. The plaza might be large enough to serve as a military parade ground. At times of crisis or fiesta, it was a space where many people could be together at once. Similar to Italian piazzas, plazas are still a center of community life, like the market-place.\nMost colonial cities in Spanish America were planned around a square \"plaza de armas\", where troops could gather.\nA \"plaza de toros\" is a bullring.\nShopping center.\nThe first shopping center in the United States, opened in Kansas City, Missouri in 1922, was called \"Country Club Plaza\" and had Spanish-style architectural details. More recently, \"plaza\" has been used to describe a shopping center, similar to a shopping mall. Calling a shopping center a \"plaza\" is to give the idea of a center of cultural life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":11},{"uri":"City_square","surface_form":"city square","offset":101},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":185},{"uri":"Cabildo","surface_form":"cabildo","offset":201},{"uri":"Fiesta","surface_form":"fiesta","offset":362},{"uri":"Piazza","surface_form":"piazza","offset":449},{"uri":"Plaza_de_Armas","surface_form":"plaza de armas","offset":596},{"uri":"Bullring","surface_form":"bullring","offset":664},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City, Missouri","offset":749},{"uri":"Country_Club_Plaza","surface_form":"Country Club Plaza","offset":792},{"uri":"Mall","surface_form":"shopping mall","offset":938}]}
