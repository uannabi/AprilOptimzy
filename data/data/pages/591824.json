In the first round of the presidential elections, PAIS Alliance candidate Len\u00EDn Moreno received 39% of the vote. Although he was more than 10% ahead of his nearest rival, Guillermo Lasso of the Creating Opportunities party, Moreno was just short of the 40% threshold required to avoid a run-off.\nAs a result, a second round was held on 2 April. In the second round Moreno was elected president with 51.16% of the vote.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":36},{"uri":"Ecuadorian_tax_haven_referendum%2C_2017","surface_form":"referendum on tax havens","offset":76},{"uri":"President_of_Ecuador","surface_form":"President","offset":135},{"uri":"National_Assembly_(Ecuador)","surface_form":"National Assembly","offset":149},{"uri":"Rafael_Correa","surface_form":"Rafael Correa","offset":188},{"uri":"PAIS_Alliance","surface_form":"PAIS Alliance","offset":209},{"uri":"Len%C3%ADn_Moreno","surface_form":"Len\u00EDn Moreno","offset":356},{"uri":"Guillermo_Lasso","surface_form":"Guillermo Lasso","offset":453},{"uri":"Creating_Opportunities","surface_form":"Creating Opportunities","offset":476}]}
