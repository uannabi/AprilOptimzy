'Retiro' means retreat or a place to rest.\nWhen it was first built, it was a little way from the city. Now, the city has become so big that it is in the city center. It was opened to the public in 1868.\nPlaces in the park include a famous rose garden, a museum, a boating lake and the Crystal Palace. Many shows and street theaters can be seen at the park on weekends.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":42},{"uri":"King_Felipe_IV","surface_form":"King Felipe IV","offset":94},{"uri":"1868","surface_form":"1868","offset":307},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":364},{"uri":"Crystal_Palace","surface_form":"Crystal Palace","offset":395}]}
