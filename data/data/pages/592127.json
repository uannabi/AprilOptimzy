{"id":592127,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfway_house","text":"=\"preserve\">A halfway house is a place that helps people with physical, mental, and emotional disabilities, giving them a place to live while they learn the social and other skills they need to live on their own or with assistance.\nThe house has staff workers from the health and helping professions, such as psychologists, social workers, and educators. They help the residents one-on-one or in groups, to adjust to more independent living. Some staff may live in the house. Some houses have large, same-sex dormitory rooms. Others have smaller rooms shared by several roommates, like living in an apartment or flat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physical_disability","surface_form":"physical","offset":62},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental","offset":72},{"uri":"Emotional_disability","surface_form":"emotional disabilities","offset":84},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychologists","offset":309},{"uri":"Social_work","surface_form":"social work","offset":324}]}
