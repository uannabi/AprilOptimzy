It was created by Mike Germakian and Stan Weston.\nCriticism.\n4Kids Entertainment gets most of its Anime series from Japan. Before showing the series in the United States and United Kingdom, the series are edited. This editing includes changing the words from Japanese to English. It may also include changing other things which could be thought to be bad. For example, cigarette smoking is often removed before being shown in the United States. Changing the names of items from Japanese items to American items is also often done. This is done so the person watching can understand the show more easily.\nMany times the story of an episode is changed completely to make it better for children. Some people believe all the changes to the Anime is a bad thing. They say that the series should be shown exactly the same as it was originally created. They feel 4Kids made \"Americanized kiddy version\" of the original series and that it is not right to do this.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":53},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":62},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":72},{"uri":"Production_company","surface_form":"production company","offset":83},{"uri":"Distribution","surface_form":"distribution","offset":140},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":156},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":167},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"world","offset":192},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":203},{"uri":"Anime","surface_form":"Anime","offset":254},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":264},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":273},{"uri":"Yu-Gi-Oh%21","surface_form":"Yu-Gi-Oh!","offset":354},{"uri":"Sonic_the_Hedgehog","surface_form":"Sonic the Hedgehog","offset":370},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":419},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox","offset":566},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"television network","offset":570},{"uri":"Bankruptcy","surface_form":"bankruptcy","offset":689},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":960},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1000},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1018},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1103},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1115},{"uri":"Cigarette","surface_form":"cigarette","offset":1213},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"episode","offset":1475}]}
