{"id":592228,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Grossenwieden","text":"The Sword of Grossenwieden is a sword that was found in Germany, in 2012. Scientists believe that it was made at the workshop that built Ulfberht swords that were not fake.\nThe sword was found in gravel from the river Weser, at Grossenwieden, which is part of the city Hessisch-Oldendorf in Niedersachsen. \"Die Gef\u00E4\u00DFteile\" [or the guard and pommel] contains sheet metal containing an alloy of tin and lead. The lead seems to originate from a source that mostly was emptied during the Age of the Romans.\nThe weight is close to one kilogram.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sword","surface_form":"sword","offset":32},{"uri":"Workshop","surface_form":"workshop","offset":117},{"uri":"Ulfberht","surface_form":"Ulfberht","offset":137},{"uri":"Fake","surface_form":"fake","offset":167},{"uri":"Gravel","surface_form":"gravel","offset":196},{"uri":"Weser","surface_form":"Weser","offset":218},{"uri":"Grossenwieden","surface_form":"Grossenwieden","offset":228},{"uri":"Hessisch-Oldendorf","surface_form":"Hessisch-Oldendorf","offset":269},{"uri":"Niedersachsen","surface_form":"Niedersachsen","offset":291},{"uri":"Guard","surface_form":"guard","offset":331},{"uri":"Pommel","surface_form":"pommel","offset":341},{"uri":"Sheet_metal","surface_form":"sheet metal","offset":358},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":384},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":393},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":401},{"uri":"Originate","surface_form":"originate","offset":425},{"uri":"Age_of_the_Romans","surface_form":"Age of the Romans","offset":484},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":507},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kilogram","offset":530}]}
