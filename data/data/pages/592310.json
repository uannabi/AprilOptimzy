Due to his hand rearing from birth, Snooty was never released to the wild and was the only manatee at the museum's aquarium that had regular human interaction.\nOn July 23, 2017, one day after his birthday, Snooty died at the South Florida Museum at the age of 69.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"West_Indian_manatee","surface_form":"Florida manatee","offset":60},{"uri":"South_Florida_Museum","surface_form":"South Florida Museum","offset":94},{"uri":"Bradenton%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Bradenton, Florida","offset":144}]}
