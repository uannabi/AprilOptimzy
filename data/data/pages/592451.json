Walker, making Boyer the only Utah-born Nobel laureate; the remainder of the Prize in that year was awarded to Danish chemist Jens Christian Skou for his discovery of the K+-ATPase.\nIn 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.\nBoyer died two months shy of his 100th birthday in Los Angeles, California on June 2, 2018 of respiratory failure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":55},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":64},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Los_Angeles","surface_form":"University of California, Los Angeles","offset":128},{"uri":"UCLA","surface_form":"UCLA","offset":167},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":196},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":225},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzymatic","offset":242},{"uri":"Biosynthesis","surface_form":"biosynthesis","offset":277},{"uri":"Adenosine_triphosphate","surface_form":"adenosine triphosphate","offset":293},{"uri":"ATP_synthase","surface_form":"ATP synthase","offset":324},{"uri":"John_E._Walker","surface_form":"John E.
