It is part of a line of past BMW roadsters such as the BMW Z1, BMW 507, BMW Z8, and the BMW Z3. The Z4 replaces the Z3. First generation production started in 2002 to replace the BMW Z3 introduced in 1995, at a plant in Greer, South Carolina, of BMW US. Both roadster and coupe versions of the car were made.\nThe Z4\u2019s body dimensions were larger and its wheelbase was longer and wider. The suspension was also upgraded to be stiffer and the car was equipped with a sport package which firmed up the steering.\nWhen it came out, it won \"Automobile\" magazine's \"Design of the Year Award\".
