Montreux lies on the northeast shore of Lake Geneva at the fork in the Roman road from Italy over the Simplon Pass, where the roads to the Roman capital of Aventicum and the road into Gaul through Besan\u00E7on separated. This made it an important settlement already in Roman times.\nIn the 12th century, viticulture was introduced to the region, and the sunny slopes of the lake from Lavaux to Montreux became an important wine-growing region.\nThe region was subject to various princes, most notably the princes of Savoy from the south side of the lake. They unified the territory which comprises the present canton of Vaud and were generally popular sovereigns.\nAfter the Burgundian Wars in the 15th century, the Swiss in Berne occupied the region without resistance, an indication of the weakness of the princes of Savoy. The Reformation made the region around Montreux and Vevey an attractive haven for Huguenots from Italy, who brought their artisanal skills and set up workshops and businesses.\nIn 1798, Napoleon liberated the region from the Bernese. In the 19th century, the tourist industry became a major commercial outlet, with the grand hotels of Montreux attracting the rich and cultured from Europe and America.\nStarting in the 19th century there were three independent municipalities that shared a central authority. This county council was made up of four deputies from Le Ch\u00E2telard, two from Les Planches and one from Veytaux. The church, the market hall of La Rouvenaz, the secondary school (the building was from 1872 and 1897) and the slaughter-house (1912) were all owned by the county council. Each municipality had its own taxes and a mayor. In 1962, the municipalities of Le Ch\u00E2telard and Les Planches merged, while Veytaux remained independent.\nVillages.\nBaugy, Brent, Caux, Chailly-sur-Montreux, Chamby, Chaulin, Ch\u00EAne, Chernex, Clarens, Collonge, Cornaux, Crin, Fontanivent, Glion, Jor, Le Ch\u00E2telard, Les Avants, Les Planches, Mont-Fleuri, Pallens, Pertit, Planchamp, Sonzier, Tavel, Territet, Vernex, Villard-sur-Chamby and Vuarennes.\nClimate.\nThe K\u00F6ppen climate classification subtype for Montreux's climate is \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).\nTwin towns.\nMontreux is twinned with the towns of Menton, France and Wiesbaden, Germany, and with the city of Chiba in Japan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Swiss town"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":17},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":37},{"uri":"Riviera-Pays-d%27Enhaut_(district)","surface_form":"Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut","offset":49},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":78},{"uri":"Vaud","surface_form":"Vaud","offset":88},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":96},{"uri":"Lake_Geneva","surface_form":"Lake Geneva","offset":118},{"uri":"Swiss_Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":159},{"uri":"Montreux_Jazz_Festival","surface_form":"Montreux Jazz Festival","offset":233},{"uri":"Wakker_Prize","surface_form":"Wakker Prize","offset":299},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":381},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":481},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":497},{"uri":"Simplon_Pass","surface_form":"Simplon Pass","offset":512},{"uri":"Aventicum","surface_form":"Aventicum","offset":566},{"uri":"Gaul","surface_form":"Gaul","offset":594},{"uri":"Besan%C3%A7on","surface_form":"Besan\u00E7on","offset":607},{"uri":"Viticulture","surface_form":"viticulture","offset":709},{"uri":"Lavaux","surface_form":"Lavaux","offset":789},{"uri":"Savoy","surface_form":"Savoy","offset":920},{"uri":"Burgundian_Wars","surface_form":"Burgundian Wars","offset":1078},{"uri":"Berne","surface_form":"Berne","offset":1128},{"uri":"Vevey","surface_form":"Vevey","offset":1281},{"uri":"Huguenots","surface_form":"Huguenots","offset":1311},{"uri":"Napoleon_I_of_France","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":1414},{"uri":"Caux%2C_Switzerland","surface_form":"Caux","offset":2198},{"uri":"Clarens%2C_Switzerland","surface_form":"Clarens","offset":2259},{"uri":"Glion","surface_form":"Glion","offset":2306},{"uri":"Le_Ch%C3%A2telard","surface_form":"Le Ch\u00E2telard","offset":2318},{"uri":"Les_Avants","surface_form":"Les Avants","offset":2332},{"uri":"Les_Planches","surface_form":"Les Planches","offset":2344},{"uri":"Territet","surface_form":"Territet","offset":2415},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":2480},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"Oceanic climate","offset":2577},{"uri":"Town_twinning","surface_form":"twinned","offset":2619},{"uri":"Menton","surface_form":"Menton","offset":2645},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":2653},{"uri":"Wiesbaden","surface_form":"Wiesbaden","offset":2664},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":2675},{"uri":"Chiba%2C_Chiba","surface_form":"Chiba","offset":2705},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":2714}]}
