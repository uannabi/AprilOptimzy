He became the first major Democrat to announce their campaign for President.\nHis campaign launched with the publication of an editorial on the \"Washington Post\"<nowiki/>'s website. On the same day, he launched a campaign Twitter account and YouTube account, on which he posted a five-minute video telling voters of his plans. He ended his campaign in January 2020.\nBackground.\nRumors of Delaney's campaign broke the day before the publication of his editorial.\nHarry J. Enten wrote in \"FiveThirtyEight\" the day after the campaign's announcement that it was highly unusual for a serious presidential candidate to announce so early. Before Delaney, Pierre S. du Pont IV had held the record of the earliest announcement before the presidential primary season when he announced his campaign for the 1988 election in 1986, 615 days before the start of the Iowa caucuses.\nDelaney ended his campaign on January 31, 2020 after falling in poll numbers and failing to qualify for the debates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Delaney","surface_form":"John Delaney","offset":34},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"U.S. Representative","offset":52},{"uri":"Maryland%27s_6th_congressional_district","surface_form":"Maryland's 6th congressional district","offset":85},{"uri":"The_Washington_Post","surface_form":"Washington Post","offset":300},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":377},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":397},{"uri":"Harry_J._Enten","surface_form":"Harry J.
