{"id":593047,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dastilbe","text":"\"Dastilbe\" is a prehistoric bony fish. It could reach a length of 25-60 mm, with a maximum length of about 150 mm.\nIt was probably an anadromous fish, meaning it lived most of its life in the sea but swam to fresh water to spawn (reproduce). Larger individuals of this predatory fish fed on smaller fishes and probably they were cannibalistic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anadromous_fish","surface_form":"anadromous fish","offset":134},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":279},{"uri":"Cannibalism","surface_form":"cannibalistic","offset":329}]}
