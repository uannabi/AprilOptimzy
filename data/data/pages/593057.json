{"id":593057,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Ciro_Cirillo","text":"e=\"preserve\">On April 27 1981, in Naples, Italy, the Red Brigades kidnapped 60-year-old Christian Democrat (DC) politician Ciro Cirillo. They killed his two-man escort in the garage of his apartment building.\nAt the time Cirillo directed reconstruction efforts in Campania devastated by the earthquake in the Irpinia region on November 23, 1980.\nCirillo was released after a controversial ransom paid by the Italian government.\nThe outcome of the Cirillo kidnapping stood in sharp contrast to the kidnapping of the Italian former Prime Minister Aldo Moro. When Moro was abducted by the Red Brigades in 1978, the Christian Democrats in government immediately took action rather waiting for a solid negotiation.\nCirillo died on 30 July 2017 at the age of 96.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Naples","surface_form":"Naples","offset":34},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":42},{"uri":"Red_Brigades","surface_form":"Red Brigades","offset":53},{"uri":"Kidnap","surface_form":"kidnap","offset":66},{"uri":"Christian_Democracy_(Italy)","surface_form":"Christian Democrat","offset":88},{"uri":"Ciro_Cirillo","surface_form":"Ciro Cirillo","offset":123},{"uri":"Campania","surface_form":"Campania","offset":264},{"uri":"1980_Irpinia_earthquake","surface_form":"earthquake in the Irpinia region","offset":291},{"uri":"Ransom","surface_form":"ransom","offset":389},{"uri":"Italian_government","surface_form":"Italian government","offset":408},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Italy","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":530},{"uri":"Aldo_Moro","surface_form":"Aldo Moro","offset":545}]}
