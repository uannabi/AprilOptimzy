{"id":59311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary","text":"e=\"preserve\">In the law, the judiciary or judicial system is the system of courts that administers justice in the name of the sovereign or state. A judicial system is used to resolve disputes.\nThe term is also used to refer collectively to the judges and magistrates who form the basis of the judiciary, as well as the other people who help keep the system running properly.\nSeparation of powers causes separate branches of government that each have a different purpose. The judiciary is the branch of government that interprets the law. Such systems may have three branches: Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. Often the judiciary branch has courts of first resort, appellate courts, and a supreme court or constitutional court. Decisions of the lower courts may be appealed to the higher courts.\nIn the United States the Judicial Branch is an integrated system of courts headed by the Supreme Court of the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":20},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":75},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":99},{"uri":"Sovereignty","surface_form":"sovereign","offset":126},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":139},{"uri":"Dispute","surface_form":"dispute","offset":183},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":244},{"uri":"Separation_of_powers","surface_form":"Separation of powers","offset":375},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":424},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"Legislature","offset":576},{"uri":"Appellate_court","surface_form":"appellate court","offset":669},{"uri":"Supreme_court","surface_form":"supreme court","offset":693},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":807},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Supreme Court of the United States","offset":889}]}
