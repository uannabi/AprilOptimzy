{"id":59320,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mata_Hari","text":"Mata Hari was the stage name of Margaretha Geertruida (Grietje) Zelle (7 August 1876, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands \u2013 15 October 1917, Vincennes, France).\nShe was a Dutch-Frisian exotic dancer and spy. She was executed by a firing squad of the French Army. French authorities thought she was a spy during World War I. Because she had relationships with both German and French officers, they thought she was a double agent (working for both sides). Her dossier (file) was released in 2017, a hundred years after her death.\nGuilty.\nGerman documents unsealed in the 1970s proved that Mata Hari was truly a German agent. In the autumn of 1915, she entered German service.\nOn the orders of section III B-Chief Walter Nicolai, she was instructed about her duties by Major Roepell during a stay in Cologne. Her direct handler was Captain Hoffmann, who gave her the code name H-21.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stage_name","surface_form":"stage name","offset":18},{"uri":"Leeuwarden","surface_form":"Leeuwarden","offset":86},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"The Netherlands","offset":98},{"uri":"Vincennes","surface_form":"Vincennes","offset":133},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":144},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":163},{"uri":"Frisians","surface_form":"Frisian","offset":169},{"uri":"Exotic_dancer","surface_form":"exotic dancer","offset":177},{"uri":"Spy","surface_form":"spy","offset":195},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"executed","offset":208},{"uri":"Firing_squad","surface_form":"firing squad","offset":222},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":303},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":374},{"uri":"Cologne","surface_form":"Cologne","offset":789}]}
