{"id":593253,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_letter_rule","text":"=\"preserve\">In English, the three letter rule (or short word rule) is the observation that content words are three letters long at least.\nOne- and two-letter words are mostly function words. Examples: \"I\", \"at\", \"he\", \"if\", \"of\", \"or\", etc. Therefore, content words almost all have at least three letters. Notice that content words with fewer than three phonemes get an extra letter or letters which are \"phonetically redundant\": the extra letters do not change the sound. Examples are such as \"ebb\", \"add\", \"egg\", \"inn\", \"bee\", \"awe\", \"buy\", \"owe\", etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":15},{"uri":"Content_word","surface_form":"content word","offset":91},{"uri":"Function_words","surface_form":"function words","offset":175},{"uri":"Letter_(alphabet)","surface_form":"letters","offset":297},{"uri":"Phoneme","surface_form":"phoneme","offset":354}]}
