{"id":593316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordplay_Showdown","text":"Swordplay Showdown is an activity in Wii Sports Resort. In this single-player activity, the player must attempt to defeat all enemies by hitting them with his or her sword. The stage (aka level or theme) is cleared when the player successfully kills all enemies. The game will end early and the player will loose if the player gets hit by enemies three times in one stage.\nMost times, enemies can be defeated with a single hit per enemy. However, on some upper levels, enemies may require either two or three hits to be defeated. Enemies that require two hits will be wearing either red or purple armor and will display two hearts next to their name. Enemies that require three hits to be defeated will be wearing black armor and will display three hearts next to their name. Enemies that require more than one hit to be defeated will be alerted to the player via the use of a \"jump-force\" alert audio sound.\nAfter clearing the volcano theme, the user unlocks 10 additional bonus \"reverse\" stages. These stages are the same themes in the same order, except the fight is played in the opposite direction. Additionally, reverse themes are more difficult than their standard equivalent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wii_Sports_Resort","surface_form":"Wii Sports Resort","offset":37}]}
