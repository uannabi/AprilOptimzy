Peter, Paul and Mary was one of the most successful folk-singing groups of the 1960s.\nUnlike most folk musicians of the early 1960s who were a part of the burgeoning music scene in the Village, Travers grew up there. She sang in the contralto range.\nTravers died on September 16, 2009 from complications of bone marrow transplant due to leukemia in Danbury, Connecticut at the age of 72.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Singer-songwriter","surface_form":"singer-songwriter","offset":75},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":111},{"uri":"Peter%2C_Paul_and_Mary","surface_form":"Peter, Paul and Mary","offset":128},{"uri":"Peter_Yarrow","surface_form":"Peter Yarrow","offset":161},{"uri":"Paul_Stookey","surface_form":"(Noel) Paul Stookey","offset":178},{"uri":"Greenwich_Village","surface_form":"Village","offset":384},{"uri":"Contralto","surface_form":"contralto","offset":432},{"uri":"Bone_marrow_transplant","surface_form":"bone marrow transplant","offset":506},{"uri":"Leukemia","surface_form":"leukemia","offset":536},{"uri":"Danbury%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Danbury, Connecticut","offset":548}]}
