{"id":593428,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulifla","text":"Caulifla is a character of the Japanese anime series Dragon Ball Super. She is a Saiyan of Universe 6 in the Universal Survival Arc.\nAppearance and Personality.\nCaulifla is a short girl of slender build and fair complexion. She wears a low cut magenta tube top, low-set purple harem trousers, long dark grey wristbands, and a pair of pointy dark grey shoes. Her hair is long, wild, and spiky. Caulifla's eyes are narrow yet big, with large black pupils, as well as thin eyebrows.\nAs noted by her brother, she has a very punkish attitude and is also recognized as a tomboy, to which she shows a strong contrast to the rest of her race, acting more akin to the Universe 7 Saiyans. Caulifla is shown to be very lazy if not self-absorbed as she initially refused to join the Tournament of Power even when learning her universe's or her own existence were on the line. It took Cabba telling her about the Super Saiyan form as well as about being able to achieve greater heights in her strength to make her agree, showing her desire to become stronger. Despite her tomboyish attitude, Caulifla cares about others, especially her prot\u00E9g\u00E9e, Kale, whom she treats like a younger sister.\nCharacter role.\nCaulifla is first seen sitting on a large throne-like chair eating a large bone of meat. After being informed by Renso, Cabba attempts to recruit her to the Universe 6 team, but Caulifla shows no interest, regardless of what may happen to Universe 6. After Cabba transforms, Caulifla accepts his invitation to the team, knowing she has the ability to not only transform into Super Saiyan, but also get stronger. Later Caulifla is seen in a rocky area with Cabba and her prot\u00E9g\u00E9e Kale, Cabba teaches Caulifla how to become a Super Saiyan. Cabba then explains to her to focus her energy on her back. Caulifla tries this and she easily transform into to a Super Saiyan. Caulifla also transform into to a Super Saiyan 2 like when she easily deflect an energy blast from a berserk Kale. In the Tournament of Power Caulifla and her Prot\u00E9g\u00E9e Kale both fought Goku in a fight. Caulifla was in her Super Saiyan 2 form while Kale was in her berserk form. Caulifla is also expected to be in future episodes of Dragon Ball Super.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dragon_Ball_Super","surface_form":"Dragon Ball Super","offset":53}]}
