{"id":593499,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary","text":"e=\"preserve\">A subsidiary is a company that is controlled by its parent company. Even though a subsidiary works on its own, and its purposes are \"different\" from that of its parent company, the parent company is in control of its subsidiary.\nA company's subsidiary is different from a company's division because a division works \"together\" with its parent company. A division's goal is usually similar to that of its parent company, and the division has to use its parent company's name. A subsidiary can use a name different from that of its parent company.\nFor example, YouTube is a \"subsidiary\" of Google, because Google is a search engine, while YouTube is a video sharing website. Google Videos is a \"division\" of Google, because Google Videos is a search engine that searches videos on the Internet. This is to match its parent company Google as a search engine. Also, YouTube has an entirely different name and logo from Google's, while Google Videos, as a division, must use Google's name and logo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":31},{"uri":"Division","surface_form":"division","offset":295},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":572},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":601},{"uri":"Search_engine","surface_form":"search engine","offset":629},{"uri":"Video_sharing","surface_form":"video sharing","offset":663},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":677},{"uri":"Google_Videos","surface_form":"Google Videos","offset":686},{"uri":"Logo","surface_form":"logo","offset":918}]}
