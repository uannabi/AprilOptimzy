It is very near to (and parallel to) Pasig River. It starts at Plaza Moraga to the west and ends at Plaza Santa Cruz and Quintin Paredes Street to the east. It contains some examples of early skyscraper design in the country.\nThe name of the street was derived from the Spanish word \"escoltar\", meaning \"to escort\" or \"to accompany\". It is known as \"calle de la Escolta\" in the Spanish language. It was built in 1594 and was the center of business and commerce in Metro Manila until the 1960s, when the center of business slowly moved to Makati.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Street","surface_form":"street","offset":40},{"uri":"Downtown","surface_form":"downtown","offset":54},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":63},{"uri":"Binondo","surface_form":"Binondo","offset":75},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":86},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":113},{"uri":"Parallel_(geometry)","surface_form":"parallel","offset":150},{"uri":"Pasig_River","surface_form":"Pasig River","offset":163},{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":318},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":396},{"uri":"Makati","surface_form":"Makati","offset":664}]}
