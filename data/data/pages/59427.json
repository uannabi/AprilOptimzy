{"id":59427,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade","text":"The Atlantic slave trade was the selling of African slaves by Europeans that happened in and around the Atlantic Ocean. It lasted from the 15th century to the 19th century. Most slaves were shipped from West Africa and brought over to the New World on a slave ship. The slaves were transported on a ship on which slaves lived in bad conditions. The journey by ship was known as the Middle Passage.\nSources of slaves.\nSome slaves were captured in battles or through raids and kidnapping. Some were sold into slavery as punishment or to pay a debt, usually by other Africans. Then they were shackled together and marched to the coast on journeys lasting weeks or months. When they arrived they were imprisoned in forts where they were purchased by Europeans. Most historians today think that between 12 million and 13 million Africans arrived in the New World.\nSlave trade.\nThe slave-trade is sometimes called the \"Maafa\" by African and African-American scholars. It means catastrophe in the Swahili language. Some slave ships worked a three-part economic cycle often called the triangular trade. It tied the economies of several regions and continents together. The main triangular trading countries were England, The Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal. Other ships just worked the slave trade.\nChristopher Columbus first came to the Americas in 1492 while seeking the West Indies. This led to an economic reason for the transatlantic slave trade. Slaves were first imported in large numbers for mining and later to grow sugarcane in plantations. Slavery is much more ancient than the transatlantic trade. Slaves were used in many ancient societies.\nAbolition and illegal trade.\nIn the 18th century, a small opposition developed against the slave trade in Britain, America, and some parts of Europe. In Britain and America, opposition to the trade was led by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and establishment Evangelicals such as William Wilberforce. People who protested against the trade were opposed by the owners of land in the Americas. After 1772, slaves became free upon entering the British isles. Abolitionism became stronger in the 19th century.\nDenmark was the first European country to ban the slave trade, in 1792, which took effect in 1803. On 22 February 1807, the work of William Wilberforce was rewarded with victory. By an overwhelming 283 votes for to 16 against, the motion for the Slave Trade Act to abolish the Atlantic slave trade was carried in the House of Commons. The United States abolished it later that year. The Royal Navy set up a Blockade of Africa to stop the trade, and treaties with other nations allowed the blockade ships to stop their slave trade. However, smuggling of slaves was very common and hundreds of thousands of black people were enslaved illegally. New York City was a center for this illegal slave trade, and judges in New York avoided punishing slave traders through the 19th century. Many slaves continued to be sent to Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico and Cuba as well as much of South America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_slave_trade","surface_form":"Atlantic slave trade","offset":4},{"uri":"Sell","surface_form":"sell","offset":33},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":44},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":52},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":62},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":104},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":203},{"uri":"New_World","surface_form":"New World","offset":239},{"uri":"Slave_ship","surface_form":"slave ship.","offset":254},{"uri":"Capture","surface_form":"capture","offset":434},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":446},{"uri":"Raid","surface_form":"raid","offset":465},{"uri":"Kidnapping","surface_form":"kidnapping","offset":475},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":518},{"uri":"Debt","surface_form":"debt","offset":541},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":626},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"forts","offset":711},{"uri":"Purchase","surface_form":"purchase","offset":733},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":762},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":935},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":952},{"uri":"Catastrophe","surface_form":"catastrophe","offset":971},{"uri":"Swahili_language","surface_form":"Swahili language","offset":990},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economic cycle","offset":1045},{"uri":"Triangular_trade","surface_form":"triangular trade","offset":1077},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":1128},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":1140},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":1189},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1204},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"The Netherlands","offset":1213},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1230},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1238},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":1248},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":1299},{"uri":"West_Indies","surface_form":"West Indies","offset":1373},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":1500},{"uri":"Sugarcane","surface_form":"sugarcane","offset":1525},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":1538},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":1572},{"uri":"Religious_Society_of_Friends","surface_form":"Religious Society of Friends","offset":1867},{"uri":"William_Wilberforce","surface_form":"William Wilberforce","offset":1945},{"uri":"Abolitionism","surface_form":"Abolitionism","offset":2121},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":2171},{"uri":"William_Wilberforce","surface_form":"William Wilberforce","offset":2303},{"uri":"House_of_Commons","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":2488},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2510},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":2558},{"uri":"Smuggling","surface_form":"smuggling","offset":2711},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":2776},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":2814},{"uri":"Judges","surface_form":"judges","offset":2875},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":3008},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":3024},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":3048}]}
