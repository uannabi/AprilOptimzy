{"id":59469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception","text":"e=\"preserve\">In psychology and the cognitive sciences, perception is the process of getting, interpreting, selecting, and organizing sensory information. It includes the collection of data from sense organs through to the interpretation made by the brain. Consider this: Light rays enter our eyes, and the brain works on this information to build up our mental picture of what is going on \"out there\". Perception is a lot more than just \"information coming in\". It is an \"active\" process.\nThere are many ways to study perception. There are biological or physiological approaches, psychological approaches through the philosophy of mind and experiments. There are studies by philosophers such as David Hume, John Locke, George Berkeley.\nHistory of the study of perception.\nPerception is one of the oldest fields of scientific psychology, and there are many theories about how it works. The Weber-Fechner law quantifies the relationship between the intensity of physical stimuli and their perceptual effects. It was the study of perception that gave rise to the Gestalt school of psychology, with its emphasis on holistic approach.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":16},{"uri":"Cognitive_science","surface_form":"cognitive science","offset":35},{"uri":"Sense","surface_form":"sensory","offset":133},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":141},{"uri":"Sense_organs","surface_form":"sense organs","offset":194},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":249},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":540},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiological","offset":554},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychological","offset":580},{"uri":"Philosophy_of_mind","surface_form":"philosophy of mind","offset":617},{"uri":"David_Hume","surface_form":"David Hume","offset":695},{"uri":"John_Locke","surface_form":"John Locke","offset":707},{"uri":"George_Berkeley","surface_form":"George Berkeley","offset":719},{"uri":"Weber-Fechner_law","surface_form":"Weber-Fechner law","offset":889},{"uri":"Gestalt_psychology","surface_form":"Gestalt","offset":1060},{"uri":"Holism","surface_form":"holistic","offset":1111}]}
