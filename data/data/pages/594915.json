{"id":594915,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River","text":"The Willamette River is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15\u00A0percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia.\nOriginally created by plate tectonics about 35\u00A0million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000\u00A0years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":32},{"uri":"Columbia_River","surface_form":"Columbia River","offset":49},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":188},{"uri":"Oregon_Coast_Range","surface_form":"Oregon Coast Range","offset":247},{"uri":"Cascade_Range","surface_form":"Cascade Range","offset":274},{"uri":"Willamette_Valley","surface_form":"Willamette Valley","offset":328},{"uri":"Salem%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Salem","offset":433},{"uri":"Portland%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Portland","offset":470},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"plate tectonics","offset":558},{"uri":"Volcanism","surface_form":"volcanism","offset":629},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":643},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":664}]}
