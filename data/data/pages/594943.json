The election was a race between incumbent Governor Pat Brown, the Democratic candidate, and actor Ronald Reagan, the Republican candidate.\nBackground.\nAfter his re-election victory over former Vice President Richard Nixon in 1962, Brown was strongly considered for Lyndon Johnson's 1964 ticket, a spot that eventually went to Hubert Humphrey. However, Brown's popularity began to sag amidst the civil disorders of the Watts riots and the early anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at U.C. Berkeley.\nThe Republicans seized upon Brown's sudden unpopularity by nominating a well known and charismatic political outsider \u2013 actor Ronald Reagan. With Richard Nixon working tirelessly behind the scenes and Reagan trumpeting his law and order campaign message, Reagan received almost 2/3 of the primary vote over George Christopher, the moderate Republican former mayor of San Francisco.\nResults.\nReagan won the election in a landslide victory with 3,742,913 (57.55%) of the vote to Brown's 2,479,174 (42.27%).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Governor_of_California","surface_form":"Governor","offset":116},{"uri":"Pat_Brown","surface_form":"Pat Brown","offset":125},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":140},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":172},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":191},{"uri":"Vice_President","surface_form":"Vice President","offset":267},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":282},{"uri":"Lyndon_Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon Johnson","offset":339},{"uri":"Hubert_Humphrey","surface_form":"Hubert Humphrey","offset":400},{"uri":"Watts_riots","surface_form":"Watts riots","offset":492},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":694},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":714},{"uri":"George_Christopher","surface_form":"George Christopher","offset":875},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":935},{"uri":"Landslide_victory","surface_form":"landslide victory","offset":988}]}
