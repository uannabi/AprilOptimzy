{"id":59495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale","text":"A logarithmic scale is a scale used when there is a large range of quantities. Common uses include earthquake strength, sound loudness, light intensity, spreading rates of epidemics, and pH of solutions.\nIt is based on orders of magnitude, rather than a standard linear scale. The value of each mark on the scale is the value at the previous mark multiplied by a constant.\nLogarithmic scales are also used in slide rules for multiplying or dividing numbers by adding or subtracting lengths on the scales.\nThe logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data cover a large range of values \u2013 the logarithm reduces this to a more manageable range.\nSome of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion (multiplying the actual input strength adds a constant to the perceived signal strength, see: Stevens' power law). That makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate. In particular, our sense of hearing perceives equal \"multiples\" of frequencies as equal \"differences\" in pitch.\nOn most logarithmic scales, \"small\" multiples (or ratios) of the underlying quantity correspond to \"small\" (possibly negative) values of the logarithmic measure.\nExamples.\nA logarithmic scale is also a graphical scale on one or both sides of a graph where a number \"x\" is printed at a distance \"c\"\u00B7log(\"x\") from the point marked with the number 1. A slide rule has logarithmic scales, and nomograms often employ logarithmic scales. On a logarithmic scale an equal difference in order of magnitude is represented by an equal distance. The geometric mean of two numbers is midway between the numbers.\nLogarithmic graph paper, before the advent of computer graphics, was a basic scientific tool. Plots on paper with one log scale can show up exponential laws, and on log-log paper power laws, as straight lines (see semilog graph, log-log graph).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scale_(measurement)","surface_form":"scale","offset":25},{"uri":"Richter_magnitude_scale","surface_form":"earthquake strength","offset":99},{"uri":"Acoustics","surface_form":"sound loudness","offset":120},{"uri":"Optics","surface_form":"light intensity","offset":136},{"uri":"Epidemics","surface_form":"epidemics","offset":172},{"uri":"PH","surface_form":"pH of solutions","offset":187},{"uri":"Orders_of_magnitude","surface_form":"orders of magnitude","offset":219},{"uri":"Linear_scale","surface_form":"linear scale","offset":263},{"uri":"Slide_rule","surface_form":"slide rule","offset":409},{"uri":"Sense","surface_form":"sense","offset":655},{"uri":"Stevens%27_power_law","surface_form":"Stevens' power law","offset":789},{"uri":"Hearing","surface_form":"hearing","offset":919},{"uri":"Perception","surface_form":"perceives","offset":927},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequencies","offset":958},{"uri":"Slide_rule","surface_form":"slide rule","offset":1353},{"uri":"Nomogram","surface_form":"nomogram","offset":1392},{"uri":"Order_of_magnitude","surface_form":"order of magnitude","offset":1481},{"uri":"Geometric_mean","surface_form":"geometric mean","offset":1541},{"uri":"Exponential_law","surface_form":"exponential law","offset":1742},{"uri":"Power_law","surface_form":"power law","offset":1781},{"uri":"Semilog_graph","surface_form":"semilog graph","offset":1816},{"uri":"Log-log_graph","surface_form":"log-log graph","offset":1831}]}
