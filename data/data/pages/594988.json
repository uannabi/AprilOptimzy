Seward.\nAs Secretary of State he believed in the use of military action to combat communism. On March 24, 1961, Rusk released a brief statement saying his delegation was to travel to Bangkok and the SEATO nations' responsibility should be considered if peace settlements are not realized.\nIn 1964, Rusk said the US would not be pushed out of the Gulf of Tonkin and that the prevention of it becoming a \"communist lake\" would be assured by the continued presence of American forces there.\nDuring his later years, Rusk showed his support of Richard Nixon and his handling of the Cold War.\nRusk died of heart failure in Athens, Georgia on December 20, 1994, at the age of 85.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"United States Secretary of State","offset":100},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
