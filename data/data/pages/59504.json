{"id":59504,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)","text":"A map scale is the size of an object compared to the size of the object's smaller representative on a map. This can be shown by a scale bar and a ratio 1:\"n\". The reader can measure a distance on the map to know what is the distance on the ground.\nPeople sometimes speak of a map as one with a \"large scale\" or \"small scale\". A \"large scale\" map makes things look large, and a \"small scale\" map makes things look small. For example, an island displayed on a 1:10,000 map will appear larger than if it were displayed on a 1:25,000 map. Thus, the former is \"large scale\". What can be confusing is that for a map of a given physical size, say 11 by 17 inches, a \"large scale\" map will have a smaller geographic extent than a \"small scale\" map centred on the same point.\nMaps with a ratio of 1:50 000 or larger (for example, 1:40 000 would be larger) are considered large scale. Maps with a ratio of 1:50 000 to 1:250 000 are considered intermediate scale. Any maps with a smaller scale (for example 1:300 000) are considered small scale.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scale_(ratio)","surface_form":"scale bar","offset":130},{"uri":"Ratio","surface_form":"ratio","offset":146},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":436}]}
