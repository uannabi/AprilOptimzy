However, it is most well known for the ghost that is said to be around the area since 1762. It is also known for being where Christian preacher and writer John Bunyan died of a fever in 1688.\nThe junction between this lane and Giltspur Street marks an area known as Pye Corner which serves as a marker for the furthest reach of the Great Fire of London. A monument, the Golden Boy of Pye Corner, marks this location.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Smithfield","surface_form":"Smithfield","offset":31},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":43},{"uri":"Giltspur_Street","surface_form":"Giltspur Street","offset":69},{"uri":"Snow_Hill%2C_London","surface_form":"Snow Hill","offset":97},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":149},{"uri":"Brothel","surface_form":"brothels","offset":202},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":251},{"uri":"John_Bunyan","surface_form":"John Bunyan","offset":367},{"uri":"Pye_Corner","surface_form":"Pye Corner","offset":478},{"uri":"Great_Fire_of_London","surface_form":"Great Fire of London","offset":544},{"uri":"Golden_Boy_of_Pye_Corner","surface_form":"Golden Boy of Pye Corner","offset":582}]}
