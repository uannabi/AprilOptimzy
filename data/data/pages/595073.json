{"id":595073,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-to-charge_ratio","text":"=\"preserve\">The mass-to-charge ratio is a physical quantity (it is an amount that can be measured). The SI unit is kg/C, which is kilograms divided by the coulomb. Sometimes the charge-to-mass ratio is used instead.\nIn a vacuum, all particles with the same mass-to-charge ratio move in the same path, when in the same strength of electric and magnetic fields.\nIt is important for things like mass spectrometry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physical_quantity","surface_form":"physical quantity","offset":42},{"uri":"Kg","surface_form":"kg","offset":115},{"uri":"Coulomb","surface_form":"C","offset":118},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kilogram","offset":130},{"uri":"Coulomb","surface_form":"coulomb","offset":155},{"uri":"Mass_spectrometry","surface_form":"mass spectrometry","offset":392}]}
