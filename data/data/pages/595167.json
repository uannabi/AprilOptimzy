Located west of the Norway\u2013Russia border, S\u00F8r-Varanger is the only Norwegian municipality that shares a land border with Russia, with the only legal border crossing at Storskog.\nHistory.\nFor some time until 1826, S\u00F8r-Varanger was a district that (at the same time) belonged to Russia and Norway; there was an Eastern Sami (\"\u00F8stsamisk\") population; the population was under Russia's jurisdiction.\nA part of Norway, it became in 1826.\nNorway's government had a fear that the county could be lost to Finland or Russia; Finland was under Russian domination (or rule) during 1809 - 1918. Part of the fear was that Finnish-speaking Kven people would help Finland/Russia, to take Northern areas, away from [the government of] Norway.\nDuring the 19th century, the area was colonized by Sami people from Norway; people from Finland; and Norwegians.\nThe mining industry in Kirkenes, and at Bj\u00F8rnevatn, was started in 1906; the majority of the county's population then, were Norwegian.\nThe people that were Finnish, mostly [lived] at three settlements: Bug\u00F8ynes in the West, Pasvik in the East, and at Neiden (between Bug\u00F8ynes and Pasvik); those who spoke Finnish, were in majority (in these 3 settlements).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Northern_Sami","surface_form":"Northern Sami","offset":14},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":120},{"uri":"Finnmark","surface_form":"Finnmark","offset":136},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":145},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":153},{"uri":"Administrative_centre","surface_form":"administrative centre","offset":165},{"uri":"Kirkenes","surface_form":"Kirkenes","offset":222},{"uri":"Settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":238},{"uri":"Bj%C3%B8rnevatn","surface_form":"Bj\u00F8rnevatn","offset":294},{"uri":"Bug%C3%B8ynes","surface_form":"Bug\u00F8ynes","offset":306},{"uri":"Elvenes%2C_Finnmark","surface_form":"Elvenes","offset":316},{"uri":"Grense_Jakobselv","surface_form":"Grense Jakobselv","offset":325},{"uri":"Hesseng","surface_form":"Hesseng","offset":343},{"uri":"Jakobsnes","surface_form":"Jakobsnes","offset":352},{"uri":"Neiden%2C_Norway","surface_form":"Neiden","offset":363},{"uri":"Sandnes%2C_Finnmark","surface_form":"Sandnes","offset":375},{"uri":"Norway%E2%80%93Russia_border","surface_form":"Norway\u2013Russia border","offset":404},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":493},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":505},{"uri":"Border_crossing","surface_form":"border crossing","offset":533},{"uri":"Storskog","surface_form":"Storskog","offset":552},{"uri":"Eastern_Sami","surface_form":"Eastern Sami","offset":693},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":720},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":766},{"uri":"Domination","surface_form":"domination","offset":926},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":941},{"uri":"Kven_people","surface_form":"Kven people","offset":1010},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1122},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonized","offset":1149},{"uri":"Sami_people","surface_form":"Sami people","offset":1162},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":1228},{"uri":"Kirkenes","surface_form":"Kirkenes","offset":1247},{"uri":"Bj%C3%B8rnevatn","surface_form":"Bj\u00F8rnevatn","offset":1264},{"uri":"Majority","surface_form":"majority","offset":1301},{"uri":"Bug%C3%B8ynes","surface_form":"Bug\u00F8ynes","offset":1426},{"uri":"Pasvik","surface_form":"Pasvik","offset":1448},{"uri":"Neiden","surface_form":"Neiden","offset":1475}]}
