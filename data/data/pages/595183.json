{"id":595183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem","text":"The Year 2038 problem could affect computers that store time as the number of seconds since 1st January 1970 at 00:00 UTC, using a 32-bit number.\nThe biggest number you can store this way is 2,147,483,647 seconds after 1 January 1970. This means 19th January 2038 at 03:14:07 UTC. The problem begins one second after this time. The computer will add 1 to this 32-bit number, and the computer will set the value to \"negative\" 2,147,483,648 seconds. This means 13th December 1901 at 20:45:52 UTC. Depending on how the computer has been programmed, the computer could behave incorrectly or even stop running.\nA solution to this problem is to store the time in a 64-bit value, which will work for billions of years. Many computers already store the time in a 64-bit number. Computers that store time in a 32-bit number will need to be reprogrammed before 2038.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computers","offset":35},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"seconds","offset":78},{"uri":"Coordinated_Universal_Time","surface_form":"UTC","offset":118},{"uri":"32-bit","surface_form":"32-bit","offset":131},{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"programmed","offset":534},{"uri":"64-bit_computing","surface_form":"64-bit","offset":659},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billions","offset":693}]}
