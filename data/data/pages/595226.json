She was a member of Georges Lamarque's \"Druids\" network. Rousseau was born in Saint-Brieuc, France.\nCodenamed AMNIARIX, she evaded Gestapo agents while gathering crucial information on the Germans' emerging rocket weapons programs from behind enemy lines. Her intelligence reports, forwarded to London, led directly to the British raid on Peenem\u00FCnde and to delays and disruptions in the V-1 and V-2 programs, saving many thousands of lives in the West.\nRousseau was captured twice and spent time in three concentration camps.\nRousseau died on 23 August 2017 in Montaigu, France, aged 98.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":121},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":135},{"uri":"Georges_Lamarque","surface_form":"Georges Lamarque","offset":169},{"uri":"Saint-Brieuc","surface_form":"Saint-Brieuc","offset":227},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":241},{"uri":"Peenem%C3%BCnde_Army_Research_Center","surface_form":"Peenem\u00FCnde","offset":488},{"uri":"Montaigu%2C_Vend%C3%A9e","surface_form":"Montaigu","offset":710}]}
