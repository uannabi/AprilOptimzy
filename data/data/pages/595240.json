They are also known for the indigenous language many still speak, Sardinian. Sardinian is quite separate from Italian and said to be one of the languages, if not the language, keeping most archaic features of ancient Latin. Sardinians have long been active to fight for the official recognition of autonomy in Italy and the protection of their cultural and environmental heritage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sardinian_language","surface_form":"Sardinian","offset":12},{"uri":"Sardinia","surface_form":"Sardinia","offset":85},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":119},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":313},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":420}]}
