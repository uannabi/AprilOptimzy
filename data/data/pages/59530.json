{"id":59530,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter","text":"The Most Noble Order of the Garter is an English order of chivalry. It was started in 1348, by King Edward III of England. The Order is the highest level of knighthood that can be given by the English monarch. It is the world's oldest national order of knighthood. Membership in the Order is limited to those people who have done many great things for the United Kingdom.\nThe Order of the Garter is made up of a very small number of people. This group includes the Sovereign (the King or Queen of Britain) and no more than 25 full members. These members are called \"Companions\". Male companions are called \"Knight Companions\". Female members are called \"Lady Companions\". There are also a number of extra members known as \"Supernumerary\" Knights and Ladies. These members are usually members of the British royal family, and monarchs of other countries.\nThe monarch alone can grant membership to the order. He or she is known as the \"Sovereign of the Garter\", and the Prince of Wales is known as a \"Knight Companion of the Garter\".\nKnights of the Order use the post-nominal letters (KG) and Ladies of the Order (LG). Knights Companion can use the title \"Sir\" before their first name, and their wives can use the title \"Lady\" before their surnames. Ladies Companion can use the title \"Lady\" before their first name, but their husbands cannot use any title.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":41},{"uri":"Order_of_chivalry","surface_form":"order of chivalry","offset":49},{"uri":"British_monarchs","surface_form":"King","offset":95},{"uri":"Edward_III_of_England","surface_form":"Edward III of England","offset":100},{"uri":"Knight","surface_form":"knight","offset":157},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":201},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"nation","offset":235},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":356},{"uri":"British_monarchs","surface_form":"Sovereign","offset":465},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":480},{"uri":"Queen","surface_form":"Queen","offset":488},{"uri":"British_royal_family","surface_form":"British royal family","offset":799},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":843}]}
