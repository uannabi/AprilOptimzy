{"id":595319,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_stand","text":"A taxicab stand (also called taxi rank, cab stand, taxi stand, cab rank, or hack stand) is a queue area on a street or on private property where taxicabs line up to wait for passengers.\nHow stands work.\nStands are normally located at airports, hotel driveways, railway stations, subway stations, bus depots, ferry terminals, shopping centres, and major street intersections. Usually stands are marked by simple painted signs.\nStands generally work as a first-come, first-served queue, so that the first taxicab to arrive on the stand (the one at the front of the line) serves the first passenger to arrive, and as the first taxicab leaves, each taxicab behind it moves ahead one spot, with the last taxicab to arrive taking the last spot.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Queue_area","surface_form":"queue area","offset":93},{"uri":"Taxicab","surface_form":"taxicab","offset":145},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":234},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":244},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":261},{"uri":"Rapid_transit","surface_form":"subway","offset":279},{"uri":"Bus","surface_form":"bus","offset":296},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":308},{"uri":"Shopping_centre","surface_form":"shopping centre","offset":325},{"uri":"First-come%2C_first-served","surface_form":"first-come, first-served","offset":453}]}
