{"id":595465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven_language","text":"=\"preserve\">The Kven language is a Finnic language spoken in northern Norway by the Kven people.\nIn 2005 the language was officially given minority status in Norway. This was for political and historical reasons. The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages has rules for the signs of a minority language. Linguistically, however, it is seen as a mutually intelligible dialect of the Finnish language. Because of this it is grouped together with the Per\u00E4pohjola dialects, such as Me\u00E4nkieli, spoken in Torne Valley in Sweden.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Finnic_languages","surface_form":"Finnic language","offset":35},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":70},{"uri":"Kven_people","surface_form":"Kven people","offset":84},{"uri":"Minority_group","surface_form":"minority","offset":139},{"uri":"European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages","surface_form":"European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages","offset":217},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"Linguistically","offset":317},{"uri":"Mutual_intelligibility","surface_form":"mutually intelligible","offset":358},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":380},{"uri":"Finnish_language","surface_form":"Finnish language","offset":395},{"uri":"Per%C3%A4pohjola_dialects","surface_form":"Per\u00E4pohjola dialects","offset":461},{"uri":"Me%C3%A4nkieli","surface_form":"Me\u00E4nkieli","offset":491},{"uri":"Torne_Valley","surface_form":"Torne Valley","offset":512},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":528}]}
