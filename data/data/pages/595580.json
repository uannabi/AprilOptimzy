{"id":595580,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage_of_France","text":"The Peerage of France () the exclusive prestigious title and position of Peer of France was held by the greatest, highest-ranking members of the French nobility, was a hereditary distinction within the French nobility which appeared in 1180 in the Middle Ages, and only a small number of noble individuals were peers. The title of 'Peer of France' was an extraordinary honour granted only to a small number of princes, dukes, counts of the Roman Catholic Church.\nFrench peerage thus differed from British peerage (to whom the term \"baronage\", also employed as the title of the lowest noble rank, was applied in its generic sense), for the vast majority of French nobles, from baron to duke, were not peers. It was analogous to the rank of Grandee of Spain in this respect.\nIt was abolished in 1789 during the French Revolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_nobility","surface_form":"French nobility","offset":202},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":248},{"uri":"British_peerage","surface_form":"British peerage","offset":497},{"uri":"Grandee_of_Spain","surface_form":"Grandee of Spain","offset":739},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":809}]}
