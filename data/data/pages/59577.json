{"id":59577,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwheat","text":"Buckwheat (or common buckwheat) is a plant whose seeds may be used as a cereal. Buckwheat is not a true grass. It is not related to wheat, because wheat \"is\" a true grass, and buckwheat is not.\nBuckwheat seeds look like small beech tree seeds. Both seeds have three sides. \"Beech\" is also called \"buck\", which is how buckwheat got its name.\nInstead, buckwheat is related to sorrel, knotweed, and rhubarb. Buckwheat is referred to as a \"pseudocereal\" because its seeds are used in cooking the same as cereals, because they have complex carbohydrates.\nThe cultivation of buckwheat grain declined sharply in the 20th century with the adoption of nitrogen fertilizer which increased the productivity of other staples.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":37},{"uri":"Cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":72},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":104},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":132},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":147},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":165},{"uri":"Beech","surface_form":"beech tree","offset":226},{"uri":"Sorrel","surface_form":"sorrel","offset":374},{"uri":"Knotweed","surface_form":"knotweed","offset":382},{"uri":"Rhubarb","surface_form":"rhubarb","offset":396},{"uri":"Carbohydrates","surface_form":"carbohydrates","offset":535},{"uri":"Fertilizer","surface_form":"fertilizer","offset":652}]}
