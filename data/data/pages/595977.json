Bus garages can also be called a bus depot but in some countries a bus depot can also mean a bus station. In many areas, bus garages are on the site of former tram sheds, where trams were stored, before they were replaced with buses. In other areas, garages were built to replace horse-bus yards.\nThe largest bus depot in the world is Millennium Park Bus Depot In Delhi India.\nGarages may also contain recovery vehicles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bus","surface_form":"bus","offset":43},{"uri":"Bus_station","surface_form":"bus station","offset":167},{"uri":"Tram","surface_form":"tram","offset":251},{"uri":"Horse-bus","surface_form":"horse-bus","offset":354},{"uri":"Millennium_Park_Bus_Depot","surface_form":"Millennium Park Bus Depot","offset":409},{"uri":"Recovery_vehicles","surface_form":"recovery vehicles","offset":476}]}
