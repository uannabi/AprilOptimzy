{"id":59622,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint","text":"The original Septuagint (often referred to \"LXX\") was a translation of the Torah, the five books of Moses from the Hebrew Bible into the Greek language. It was done between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC in Alexandria. It was the first translations of the Hebrew Bible. After 350 years, the Church translated all the books of the Old Testament, and it also has books that Catholics and Orthodox Christians call the Deuterocanon. These books are called Apocrypha by Protestants because they do not think these books are sacred.\nAn ancient tradition says that 70 Jewish scholars were in a different room when they translated the Torah from Hebrew into Greek, yet they all wrote down exactly the same text. People thought this was a miracle. The Latin language word for \"70\" is \"septuaginta\", and the word \"Septuagint\" comes from that. Another way to write \"70\" is \"LXX\" which is why writers sometimes use that as a short name for Septuagint.\nThe Septuagint was used as the starting point for some later translations of the Bible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Torah","surface_form":"Torah","offset":75},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":115},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek language","offset":137},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":205},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old Testament","offset":328},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholics","offset":370},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Orthodox Christians","offset":384},{"uri":"Deuterocanonical_books","surface_form":"Deuterocanon","offset":413},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"Apocrypha","offset":450},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":463},{"uri":"Sacred","surface_form":"sacred","offset":517},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":559},{"uri":"Torah","surface_form":"Torah","offset":625},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":636},{"uri":"Miracle","surface_form":"miracle","offset":728},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin language","offset":741}]}
