Irma is also the 4th consecutive hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season\u2014after Franklin, Gert, and Harvey. The storm threatened the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Irma was also forecast to threaten the East Coast of the United States, but later forecast to hit Southwest Florida.\nIrma was the first major hurricane to develop in the eastern Atlantic since Hurricane Julia in 2010. The storm developed on August 30, 2017 near the Cape Verde islands. On September 5, 2017, the storm became a Category 5 hurricane. It had maximum sustained winds of 180 miles per hour since Hurricane Wilma in twelve years earlier. As it hit landfall, Irma went down to a Category 2 hurricane. Irma was the easternmost Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic Ocean.\nHurricane or tropical storm watches and warnings were issued from Haiti to Dominica.\nHurricane Irma inflicted $77 billion worth of damage especially in Florida after making landfall in Florida.\nDue to significant amount of damage and loss of life from the storm especially in Florida, the name \"Irma\" was retired in April 2018 by the World Meteorological Organization, and it was replaced with \"Idalia\" for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Category 5","offset":21},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":32},{"uri":"Hurricane_Harvey","surface_form":"Harvey","offset":297},{"uri":"Leeward_Islands","surface_form":"Leeward Islands","offset":330},{"uri":"Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"Virgin Islands","offset":347},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":366},{"uri":"East_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"East Coast of the United States","offset":418},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":487},{"uri":"Hurricane_Julia_(2010)","surface_form":"Hurricane Julia","offset":572},{"uri":"Cape_Verde","surface_form":"Cape Verde","offset":645},{"uri":"Hurricane_Wilma","surface_form":"Hurricane Wilma","offset":787},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":953},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":1035},{"uri":"Dominica","surface_form":"Dominica","offset":1044},{"uri":"World_Meteorological_Organization","surface_form":"World Meteorological Organization","offset":1303}]}
