{"id":59632,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)","text":"The World Heavyweight Championship was one of the top wrestling championships in the WWE along with the WWE Championship. It was created on \"RAW\" to match \"SmackDown's\" WWE Championship in August 2002. Some of the past champions include Edge, Triple H, The Undertaker, Booker T, Batista, and Kurt Angle.\nThe World Heavyweight Championship was brought to Raw by then-General Manager Eric Bischoff after WWE Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown. Bischoff awarded the championship to Triple H, but he had to defend it against his then-best friend, Ric Flair. Triple H was successful and has held the championship on five different occasions. Other holders of this prestigious championship include Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, Rey Mysterio and more.\nThe final champion was Randy Orton. He beat then-champion John Cena on December 15, 2013 at. He was already WWE Champion when he won the championship and unified the World Heavyweight Championship with the WWE Championship to make the \"WWE World Heavyweight Championship\". The World Heavyweight Championship was retired the next day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"wrestling","offset":54},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":85},{"uri":"WWE_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Championship","offset":104},{"uri":"WWE_Raw","surface_form":"RAW","offset":141},{"uri":"WWE_SmackDown","surface_form":"SmackDown's","offset":156},{"uri":"WWE_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Championship","offset":169},{"uri":"August","surface_form":"August","offset":189},{"uri":"2002","surface_form":"2002","offset":196},{"uri":"Edge_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Edge","offset":237},{"uri":"Triple_H","surface_form":"Triple H","offset":243},{"uri":"The_Undertaker","surface_form":"The Undertaker","offset":253},{"uri":"Booker_Huffman","surface_form":"Booker T","offset":269},{"uri":"Dave_Batista","surface_form":"Batista","offset":279},{"uri":"Kurt_Angle","surface_form":"Kurt Angle","offset":292},{"uri":"Randy_Orton","surface_form":"Randy Orton","offset":783},{"uri":"John_Cena","surface_form":"John Cena","offset":818},{"uri":"WWE_Championship","surface_form":"WWE Champion","offset":868}]}
