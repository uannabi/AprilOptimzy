{"id":59641,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Islamic calendar () is a calendar. It is used to determine islamic holidays in most of Islam. It is a lunar calendar. It has 12 months, and 354 or 355 days. This means that each year, the calendar is about 11 days shorter than a solar calendar, like the Gregorian. Islamic years are often called \"hijra\" years, because the first year of the calendar when the \"hijra\" occurred, that is when Prophet Muhammad went from Mecca to Medina.\nThe current Islamic Calendar year is 1442 H\" (AH = Anno Hegir\u00E6 = Hijri year)\".\nTwo Islamic countries (Iran and Afghanistan) use a different calendar, the Solar Hijri Calendar.\nThe hijiri calendar uses the moon.\nMonths.\nA lunar month (one new moon to the next) lasts a little over 29.5 days. For convenience, a month is the Islamic calendar is either 29 days or 30 days, one after the other. So a 29-day month is followed by a 30-day month (29+30 is the same as 29.5+29.5). In most years, that means that a year of 12 calendar months last 354 days. But that \"a little over\" is 44 minutes every month so, to keep the calendar in step with reality, an extra day is needed nearly every third year, so these years are 355 days long.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":42},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"islam","offset":76},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":104},{"uri":"Lunar_calendar","surface_form":"lunar calendar","offset":119},{"uri":"Solar_calendar","surface_form":"solar calendar","offset":246},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian","offset":271},{"uri":"Hijra_(Islam)","surface_form":"hijra","offset":377},{"uri":"Prophet_Muhammad","surface_form":"Prophet Muhammad","offset":407},{"uri":"Mecca","surface_form":"Mecca","offset":434},{"uri":"Medina","surface_form":"Medina","offset":443},{"uri":"Solar_Higri_Calendar","surface_form":"Solar Hijri Calendar","offset":605}]}
