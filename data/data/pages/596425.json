{"id":596425,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoloid_(race)","text":"Mongoloid was a word for a person from East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Arctic, the Americas, or the Pacific Islands. The group of these persons was called \"Mongoloid race\". In former times, many people divided human beings into three races. These races were called \"Mongoloid\", \"Caucasoid\", and \"Negroid\". Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong.\nGerman anthropologists invented the name \"Mongolian race\" in the 18th century. Later, the name changed to \"Mongoloid\". This means \"looking like a Mongol\".\nThe word \"mongoloid\" was once also used to mean a person with Down syndrome. This was an offensive term used because people said it was like \"Mongolian idiocy\" or \"Mongolian imbecility\". Down syndrome has nothing to do with Mongol people: it is a genetic condition found in all types of humans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":16},{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":27},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":39},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":50},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":70},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":82},{"uri":"Pacific_Islands","surface_form":"Pacific Islands","offset":99},{"uri":"Human_being","surface_form":"human being","offset":209},{"uri":"Historical_definitions_of_race","surface_form":"races","offset":233},{"uri":"Caucasian_race","surface_form":"Caucasoid","offset":278},{"uri":"Negroid","surface_form":"Negroid","offset":295},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":371},{"uri":"Anthropology","surface_form":"anthropologists","offset":445},{"uri":"Mongol","surface_form":"Mongol","offset":584},{"uri":"Down_syndrome","surface_form":"Down syndrome","offset":655},{"uri":"Offence","surface_form":"offensive","offset":682},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":840}]}
