The reef was reported by the master of the Italian barque \"Filippo\" who saw it on 28 June 1886. From an unidentified report of breakers dated 1926, it was estimated to have a water depth of only, and appeared to be about long northwest to southeast, and less in width.\nThe only sighting referenced shows a date of 1926. The topographic data supplied by the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO), however, shows a sea depth of. It is therefore likely that this 1926 report is an error, and that Filippo Reef is a phantom island. Maps showing the reef rely on the report of 1926, and are likely in error.\nNevertheless, it is marked in the 2005 edition of the \"National Geographic Atlas of the World\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":18},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":36},{"uri":"Starbuck_Island","surface_form":"Starbuck Island","offset":77},{"uri":"Line_Islands","surface_form":"Line Islands","offset":100},{"uri":"Filippo","surface_form":"Filippo","offset":173},{"uri":"Breaker_(reef)","surface_form":"breakers","offset":241},{"uri":"General_Bathymetric_Chart_of_the_Oceans","surface_form":"General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans","offset":471},{"uri":"Phantom_island","surface_form":"phantom island","offset":636}]}
