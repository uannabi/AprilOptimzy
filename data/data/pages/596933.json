In addition to its use as a weapon, the sword has been the object of special considerations forming part of funerary rituals, mythology and other ancient traditions.\nChronology details.\nThe present chronology includes diverse and relatively uneven documents. The need to group them into a single list responds to the desire of simplicity.\nBronze Swords.\nThe first bronze swords with a length equal to or greater than 60\u00A0cm date from the 17th century BC in regions of the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. They emerged as an evolution of shorter weapons of the type of the daggers. To make a sword useful in combat, one must have a correct alloy, give it the right shape and apply the necessary thermal (and finishing) treatments. The longer is a sword, the stresses (bending and buckling) are more important. What is needed is a weapon that is hard enough (to cut), fairly flexible (without being fragile) and tenacious enough to withstand the blows in the fights.\nThe manufacturing process is summarized as follows: The bronze swords were cast into moulds, heated to a certain temperature and allowed to cool slowly. Finally they cold hammered (hitting them with a hammer on a type anvil) to increase its hardness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sword","surface_form":"sword","offset":23},{"uri":"Black_Sea","surface_form":"Black Sea","offset":551},{"uri":"Aegean_Sea","surface_form":"Aegean Sea","offset":569}]}
