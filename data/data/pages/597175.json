{"id":597175,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_in_liquids","text":"Fluid pressure is a measurement of the force per unit area. Fluid pressure can be caused by gravity, acceleration, or forces in a closed container. Since a fluid has no definite shape, its pressure applies in all directions. Fluid pressure can also be amplified through hydraulic mechanisms and changes with the velocity of the fluid.\nIn a fluid column, as the depth increases, the\u00A0pressure increases as well. Pressure (P) increases because as you go deeper, fluid at a lower depth has to support fluid above it as well.\u00A0Therefore to define fluid pressure, we can say that it is the pressure at a point within a fluid arising due to the weight of the fluid.\nPressure in liquids is equally divided in all directions, therefore if a force is applied to one point of the liquid, it will be transmitted to all other points within the liquid.\nP = \"h\u03C1g (Pressure = Height/Depth of the liquid X Density of the liquid X Gravitational pull (9.81m/s))\".\nThe SI Unit (International System of Unit) of pressure is the Pascal, or Newton per meter squared (N/m^2).\nPoints along the same depth will have the same pressure, while points at different depths will have different pressure.\nAn object that is partly, or completely submerged in a fluid experiences a greater pressure on its bottom surface than on its top surface. This causes a resultant force upwards. This force is called upthrust, and is also known as buoyancy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"Fluid","offset":60},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":92},{"uri":"Acceleration","surface_form":"acceleration","offset":101},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"forces","offset":118},{"uri":"Hydraulics","surface_form":"hydraulic","offset":270},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"SI Unit","offset":948}]}
