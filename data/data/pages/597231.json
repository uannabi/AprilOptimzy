Paul first came into prominence for playing the role of Dirk on the Disney Channel series \"Bizaardvark\". In 2018, Jake had a boxing match against YouTube star Deji. His boxing schema proved to be too much for Deji to handle, and Jake stopped Deji in the sixth round. Many boxing experts and pundits such as Tony Bellew, Matthew Macklin, Tim Storer, Carl Froch, and more credited Jake, as he performed excellent for a novice boxer. His boxing record currently stands at 1-0-0.\nEarly life.\nPaul was born in Cleveland, and grew up in Westlake, Ohio. He is the son of Pamela Ann Stepnick (\"n\u00E9e\" Meredith) and realtor Gregory Allan Paul. His older brother, YouTuber Logan Paul, claims that Jake is of Austrian-Jewish, English, German-Jewish, Hungarian-Jewish, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry.\nCareer.\nPaul began his career in September 2013 posting videos on Vine. By the time Vine shut down, Jake Paul had 5.3 million followers and 2 billion plays on the app.\nIn 2015, it was announced that Paul would be starring as Dirk in Disney Channel's new comedy series \"Bizaardvark\".\nOn January 5, 2017, Paul was among the invited guests at an event at the White House centering on social media. As a stunt for his YouTube vlog channel, he hid in a bathroom there before sneaking out of the White House at 3:30am without being confronted by security.\nOn January 17, 2017, it was reported Paul had launched Team 10 with $1 million in financing to create influencer marketing management and creative agency around teen entertainment. Investors include Danhua Capital, Horizons Alpha, Vayner Capital, Sound Ventures & A-Grade Investments, and Adam Zeplain.\nOn May 30, 2017, Paul released a song and music video alongside Team 10, titled \"It's Everyday Bro\", which achieved over 70 million views on YouTube in its first month and has become the second most disliked video on YouTube, behind \"Baby\" by Justin Bieber. The song peaked at number 94 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the chart dated June 24, 2017.\nDisturbances in Beverly Grove.\nOn July 18, 2017, it was reported that Paul's neighbors in the Beverly Grove neighborhood of Los Angeles were meeting with city council members and police officials regarding whether to file a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Paul. This came after Paul made his home address public, leading crowds of fans to gather outside Paul's residence, and noise complaints by neighbors. On April 24, 2018, it was reported that Paul was sued by Cobra Acquisitions; the company that owns the house, for $2.5 million.\nSeparation from Disney.\nOn July 22, 2017, during the middle of filming the second season of \"Bizaardvark\", the Disney Channel announced that Paul would be leaving the series, saying in a statement \"We've mutually agreed that Jake Paul will leave his role on the Disney Channel series 'Bizaardvark'. On behalf of the production company, the cast and crew, we thank Jake for his good work on the TV series for the past 18 months and extend our best wishes to him.\" The announcement followed a KTLA 5 news report about public complaints from Paul's neighbors regarding the noise generated by Paul's pranks, parties, fire hazards and the large crowds of Paul's fans congregating in their neighborhood. Paul later confirmed the news on his Twitter page, saying he would now focus more on his personal brand, his YouTube channel, his business ventures, and more adult acting roles. Paul later revealed in an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that he was actually fired from \"Bizaardvark\" by Disney who wanted to expedite the process of weaning him off the show due to the KTLA segment.\nExplicit YouTube video.\nOn January 3, 2018, Paul uploaded a video to his YouTube channel titled \"I lost my virginity\" which caused controversy for being too sexually explicit and inappropriate for his younger audience. The video was criticized for its thumbnail which featured Paul and his then girlfriend Erika Costell semi-nude on a bed with Costell on top of Paul in a sexual position. The thumbnail was later changed with both Paul and Costell fully clothed and not touching each other.
