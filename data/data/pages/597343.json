It studies how people and environment have an effect on each other.\nThe study of people includes their communities, cultures, economies. The environment studied is mostly about locations. Locations include where people live, when people move, where they move to, what customs they have, what recreations they have.\nHuman societies develop in relation to the environment they are in. The relationship between people and the environment can change over time and across different locations. Human geography studies these changes.\nThe field of geography can be divided into physical geography and human geography. Human geography is also closely associated with social sciences and philosophy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":31},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":68},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"communities","offset":145},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":158},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economies","offset":168},{"uri":"Custom","surface_form":"custom","offset":310},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":334},{"uri":"Physical_geography","surface_form":"physical geography","offset":612},{"uri":"Social_sciences","surface_form":"social sciences","offset":700},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":720}]}
