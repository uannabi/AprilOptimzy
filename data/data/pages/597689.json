{"id":597689,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_reserve","text":"A marine reserve is a type of marine protected area. The protection is for seas, oceans, estuaries or large lakes. Laws protect the plants and animals in a reserve. The area is kept safe for conservation and to provide special opportunities for study or research.\nIn a marine reserve people are not allowed to take plants or animals, except for research. This includes fishing. People are still allowed to swim or scuba dive.\nThe Ningaloo Reef in Australia is an example of a marine reserve. This reef includes six of the seven types of sea turtles in the world. Another example is Hol Chan Marine Reserve in Belize. Hol Chan includes coral reefs and a mangrove forest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marine_protected_area","surface_form":"marine protected area","offset":30},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":75},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":81},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuaries","offset":89},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":108},{"uri":"Laws","surface_form":"Laws","offset":115},{"uri":"Conservation_biology","surface_form":"conservation","offset":191},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":254},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":369},{"uri":"Scuba_diving","surface_form":"scuba dive","offset":414},{"uri":"Ningaloo_Reef","surface_form":"Ningaloo Reef","offset":430},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":447},{"uri":"Sea_turtle","surface_form":"sea turtle","offset":537},{"uri":"Hol_Chan_Marine_Reserve","surface_form":"Hol Chan Marine Reserve","offset":582},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":609},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":635},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":653}]}
