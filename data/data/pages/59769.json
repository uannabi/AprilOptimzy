It is owned by Fox Broadcasting Company.\nShows.\nThe channel plays up to 15 hours of live shows every day. 6 hours of these are opinion shows. The hosts of its opinion shows are Sean Hannity, Neil Cavuto, Greta Van Susteren, and Geraldo Rivera. Fox News Network leans right-wing, but has some liberals (such as Greta van Susteren).\nCriticisms.\nThere was a documentary called \"Outfoxed\" that criticized the channel because they say it is biased towards conservatives and the US Republican Party in its reporting. Fox says its opinion shows are conservative but its regular news programs are not. President Barack Obama, through a spokesperson, accused Fox News of working for the Republican Party. Fox has also been accused of having a right-wing bias, racism, discrimination, race baiting and gender inequality. Roger Ailes has called Fox News \"the balance\" against the liberal networks news groups such as ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, Cable News Network, and MSNBC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":23},{"uri":"Cable","surface_form":"cable","offset":32},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":52},{"uri":"Rupert_Murdoch","surface_form":"Rupert Murdoch","offset":92},{"uri":"Roger_Ailes","surface_form":"Roger Ailes","offset":111},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox Broadcasting Company","offset":139},{"uri":"Opinion","surface_form":"opinion","offset":283},{"uri":"Sean_Hannity","surface_form":"Sean Hannity","offset":301},{"uri":"Geraldo_Rivera","surface_form":"Geraldo Rivera","offset":352},{"uri":"Documentary","surface_form":"documentary","offset":479},{"uri":"Bias","surface_form":"bias","offset":560},{"uri":"Conservatives_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"conservatives","offset":575},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":600},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":858},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":883},{"uri":"ABC_News","surface_form":"ABC News","offset":1030},{"uri":"NBC_News","surface_form":"NBC News","offset":1040},{"uri":"CBS_News","surface_form":"CBS News","offset":1050},{"uri":"Cable_News_Network","surface_form":"Cable News Network","offset":1060},{"uri":"MSNBC","surface_form":"MSNBC","offset":1084}]}
