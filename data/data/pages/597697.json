Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm, and his decision is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its NATO allies that could have resulted in large-scale nuclear war.\nInvestigation later confirmed that the Soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lieutenant_colonel","surface_form":"lieutenant colonel","offset":71},{"uri":"Soviet_Air_Defence_Forces","surface_form":"Soviet Air Defence Forces","offset":97},{"uri":"Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007","surface_form":"Korean Air Lines Flight 007","offset":204},{"uri":"Oko","surface_form":"Oko","offset":291},{"uri":"False_alarm","surface_form":"false alarm","offset":469},{"uri":"Nuclear_attack","surface_form":"nuclear attack","offset":558},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":580},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":602},{"uri":"Nuclear_warfare","surface_form":"nuclear war","offset":654}]}
