{"id":5978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates","text":"Hippocrates (c. 460 \u2013 c. 370 BC) was a Greek doctor who is called the \"father of medicine\". He was the first person to teach that people got sick for scientific reasons. Previously, people believed that disease was caused by angry gods.\nMany of Hippocrates' writings are still important to doctors. For example, patient confidentiality, meaning that doctors can only discuss a patient with the patient themselves. Another of his ideas is to never knowingly lead a patient to suffering or death. These kinds of ideas are part of medical ethics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":29},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":39},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":45},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":81},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific","offset":150},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":203},{"uri":"Medical_ethics","surface_form":"medical ethics","offset":528}]}
