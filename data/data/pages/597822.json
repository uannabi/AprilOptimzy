{"id":597822,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphallaxis","text":"Morphallaxis is the when some living things regenerate or regrow tissue after the original tissue dies. The word comes from the Greek \"allazein\", which means \"to exchange\".\nFor example, if a Cnidarian hydra, a microscopic animal, is cut in half, two new hydra grow.\nAround the year 1930, scientists Wilson and Child showed that if the hydra was smashed to pulp and put through an instrument with tiny holes in it to separate each cell individually but without breaking any one cell, the hydra completely reformed itself.\nMost tissue in Morphallaxis grows from material already present material. Not much new tissue is created.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cnidaria","surface_form":"Cnidarian","offset":191}]}
