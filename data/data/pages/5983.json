This is also called picking crops. Crop failure (also known as harvest failure) is a loss or reduced crop yield due to plants being damaged, killed, or destroyed. Sometimes it brings famine.\n\"Harvest\" can also mean to collect other things than plants such as cultivated bivalves including oysters, scallops, and other animals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Collect","surface_form":"collect","offset":17},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":39},{"uri":"Grow","surface_form":"grown","offset":51},{"uri":"Ground","surface_form":"ground","offset":64},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":94},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"fall","offset":114},{"uri":"Crops","surface_form":"crops","offset":155},{"uri":"Crop_yield","surface_form":"crop yield","offset":228},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":310},{"uri":"Aquaculture","surface_form":"cultivated","offset":386},{"uri":"Bivalve","surface_form":"bivalve","offset":397},{"uri":"Oyster","surface_form":"oyster","offset":416},{"uri":"Scallop","surface_form":"scallop","offset":425},{"uri":"Animals","surface_form":"animals","offset":445}]}
