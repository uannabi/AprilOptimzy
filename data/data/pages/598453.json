One review said he \"echoes the evocative delivery of Otis Redding\".\nCalling himself \"the screaming eagle of soul\", Bradley was the subject of the documentary \"Soul of America\" which premiered at South by Southwest in 2012.\nBradley was diagnosed with stomach cancer in October 2016. He died on September 23, 2017 in Brooklyn, New York at the age of 68.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Daptone_Records","surface_form":"Daptone Records","offset":115},{"uri":"Otis_Redding","surface_form":"Otis Redding","offset":384},{"uri":"South_by_Southwest","surface_form":"South by Southwest","offset":526},{"uri":"Stomach_cancer","surface_form":"stomach cancer","offset":581},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":646},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":656}]}
