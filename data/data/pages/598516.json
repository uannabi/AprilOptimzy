The administrative centre is Murmansk, where most of the population lives. The oblast has a population of 741,511.\nHistory.\nRecords show people first began to populate the area sometime between 8000 BC and 7000 BC. The first permanent towns began to appear in the 15th century. These towns were mainly on the Tersky Coast. In the late 15th century, the area became part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. At the time, most of the economy was based on fishing.\nOblast divisions.\nThe oblast is divided into six districts, six closed cities and six cities and towns under the oblast's control.\nDistricts.\nThe six districts are: Kandalakshsky District, Kolsky District, Kovdorsky District, Lovozersky District, Pechengsky District, Tersky District.\nClosed cities.\nThe six closed cities are: Gadzhiyevo, Ostrovnoy, Polyarny, Severomorsk, Snezhnogorsk and Zaozyorsk.\nThese cities are controlled by the federal government. A \"closed city\" is a term for a city where residents need special permission to live there.\nCities and towns under the oblast's control.\nThe six cities and towns under the oblast's control are: Murmansk, Apatity, Kirovsk, Monchegorsk, Olenegorsk and Polyarnye Zori.\nThese cities have their own oblast territory.\nClimate.\nMost of the oblast is in the arctic circle, meaning in summer the sun is in the sky all day, while at night the sun never rises. The entire oblast also has a subarctic climate, with very cold winters, and short, warm summers. The area isn't as cold as other locations of the same longitude because of the effects of the North Atlantic Current. The current's influence also means that the northern coast is generally \"warmer\" than the southern central region.\nDemographics.\nThe native people of the area are the Sami, but they only make up 0.2% of the population today.\nApproximately 42% of the population adhere to the Russian Orthodox Church. Another 4.5% follow another form of Christianity. 1% of the population is Muslim, 12% are atheists and 28% are \"spiritual but not religious.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Federal_subjects_of_Russia","surface_form":"federal subject","offset":77},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":109},{"uri":"Administrative_centre","surface_form":"administrative centre","offset":121},{"uri":"Murmansk","surface_form":"Murmansk","offset":146},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th century","offset":381},{"uri":"Tersky_Coast","surface_form":"Tersky Coast","offset":426},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Moscow","offset":494},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":563},{"uri":"Closed_city","surface_form":"closed cities","offset":636},{"uri":"Kandalakshsky_District","surface_form":"Kandalakshsky District","offset":737},{"uri":"Kolsky_District","surface_form":"Kolsky District","offset":761},{"uri":"Kovdorsky_District","surface_form":"Kovdorsky District","offset":778},{"uri":"Lovozersky_District","surface_form":"Lovozersky District","offset":798},{"uri":"Pechengsky_District","surface_form":"Pechengsky District","offset":819},{"uri":"Tersky_District%2C_Murmansk_Oblast","surface_form":"Tersky District","offset":840},{"uri":"Gadzhiyevo","surface_form":"Gadzhiyevo","offset":899},{"uri":"Ostrovnoy%2C_Murmansk_Oblast","surface_form":"Ostrovnoy","offset":911},{"uri":"Polyarny%2C_Murmansk_Oblast","surface_form":"Polyarny","offset":922},{"uri":"Severomorsk","surface_form":"Severomorsk","offset":932},{"uri":"Snezhnogorsk%2C_Murmansk_Oblast","surface_form":"Snezhnogorsk","offset":945},{"uri":"Zaozyorsk","surface_form":"Zaozyorsk","offset":962},{"uri":"Murmansk","surface_form":"Murmansk","offset":1222},{"uri":"Apatity","surface_form":"Apatity","offset":1232},{"uri":"Kirovsk%2C_Murmansk_Oblast","surface_form":"Kirovsk","offset":1241},{"uri":"Monchegorsk","surface_form":"Monchegorsk","offset":1250},{"uri":"Olenegorsk%2C_Murmansk_Oblast","surface_form":"Olenegorsk","offset":1263},{"uri":"Polyarnye_Zori","surface_form":"Polyarnye Zori","offset":1278},{"uri":"Arctic_Circle","surface_form":"arctic circle","offset":1378},{"uri":"Subarctic_climate","surface_form":"subarctic climate","offset":1507},{"uri":"Longitude","surface_form":"longitude","offset":1629},{"uri":"North_Atlantic_Current","surface_form":"North Atlantic Current","offset":1669},{"uri":"Sami_people","surface_form":"Sami","offset":1860},{"uri":"Russian_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Russian Orthodox Church","offset":1968},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":2029},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":2067},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheists","offset":2083}]}
