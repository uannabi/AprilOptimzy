{"id":598809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore","text":"Roy Stewart Moore (born February 11, 1947) is an American lawyer, politician, and former judge.\nMoore has earned significant national attention and controversy over his strongly anti-homosexual, anti-Muslim, and far-right views, his belief that Christianity should order public policy, as well as his past ties to neo-Confederates and white nationalist groups.\nEarly life.\nMoore was born in Gadsden, Alabama. He studied at the United States Military Academy and at the University of Alabama. He married Kayla Kisor. They have four children. Many women called him a hebephile and ephebophile after he courted them while they were young teens.\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\nMoore was elected to the position of Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2001, but removed from his position in November 2003 by the Alabama Court of the Judiciary for refusing to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments commissioned by him from the Alabama Judicial Building, despite orders to do so by a federal court.\nMoore was again elected Chief Justice in 2013, but was suspended in May 2016, for encouraging judges to continue to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage despite the fact that it had been deemed unconstitutional. Following an unsuccessful appeal, Moore resigned in April 2017.\nFailed governor campaigns.\nMoore sought the Republican nomination for the governorship of Alabama in 2006, but lost to incumbent Bob Riley in the June primary by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. He sought the Republican nomination for the office again in 2010, but placed fourth in the Republican primary.\nUnited States special senate race, 2017.\nMoore defeated incumbent Luther Strange in the Republican primary to fill the United States Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions upon Sessions's confirmation as Attorney General of the United States. He faced Democratic nominee Doug Jones in the special election on December 12, 2017.\nAccording to Vox, if Moore is elected, he is likely to be the most far-right Senator, \"far afield from even the most conservative Republican currently in the Senate.\"\nMoore lost the election to Jones with his 48.8% to Jones's 49.6%.\nSexual harassment allegations.\nIn November 2017, he was accused of sexual abuse of underage girls in the past. Republicans such as John McCain and Mitt Romney called for Moore to drop out of the race after the allegations were reported. Other senators withdrew their endorsements of Moore's Senate candidacy. Days later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he believes the women who made the accusations and that Moore should \"step aside\". Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also called for Moore to abandon his campaign. President Donald Trump, however, expressed support for Moore.\n2020 Senate race.\nMoore announced on June 20, 2019 that he would challenge for Doug Jones once again for his Senate seat in the 2020 election.
