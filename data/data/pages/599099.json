Political parties that do not want independence will boycott the referendum.\nThe referendum is illegal according to the Spanish constitution. The Constitutional Court of Spain suspended the referendum on 7 September 2017. The Catalonia government said the court order was not valid, and got support from 750 of 948 municipalities. This led to the 2017 Spanish constitutional crisis.\nThe Government of Spain opposes Catalan independence. However, the Catalan government says it has the right to independence. Catalonia has not gotten any international support.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":46},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":59},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalonia","offset":87},{"uri":"Constitutional_Court_of_Spain","surface_form":"Constitutional Court of Spain","offset":262},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":431},{"uri":"2017_Spanish_constitutional_crisis","surface_form":"2017 Spanish constitutional crisis","offset":463},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Government of Spain","offset":503},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalan government","offset":566}]}
