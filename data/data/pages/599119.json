{"id":599119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uromys_vika","text":"\"Uromys vika\", also known as the Vangunu giant rat and locally known as the vika, is a giant arboreal species of rodent in the family Muridae. The rat was discovered in the island of Vangunu in the Solomon Islands in 2015, after years of searching based on local stories, and described in 2017. It was identified as a new species on the basis of its skull, skeleton and a detailed DNA analysis.\nDiscovery and publication.\nIn November 2015 a wildlife ranger (Hikuna Judge) from the Zaira Conservation Area, saw something (outside the conservation area): \"a large rat, [falling] from a 10m tree felled by loggers. The fall killed the rat - but the ranger shipped it to the Queensland Museum, in Australia, where... Lavery was a fellow\". Tyrone Lavery and Hikuna Judge published a species description, in 2017.\nHabitat.\nThe rat fell of a tree, outside Zaira, a village on Vangunu Island.\nThe species is likely to be called \"critically endangered\", because of the small amount of forest habitat (about 80 km2) remaining on the island and ongoing logging.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":93},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":102},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":113},{"uri":"Muridae","surface_form":"Muridae","offset":134},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":173},{"uri":"Vangunu","surface_form":"Vangunu","offset":183},{"uri":"Solomon_Islands","surface_form":"Solomon Islands","offset":198},{"uri":"Search","surface_form":"search","offset":238},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":381},{"uri":"Wildlife","surface_form":"wildlife","offset":441},{"uri":"Ranger","surface_form":"ranger","offset":450},{"uri":"Hikuna_Judge","surface_form":"Hikuna Judge","offset":458},{"uri":"Zaira_Conservation_Area","surface_form":"Zaira Conservation Area","offset":481},{"uri":"Logger","surface_form":"logger","offset":603},{"uri":"Tyrone_Lavery","surface_form":"Lavery","offset":713},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"fellow","offset":726},{"uri":"Tyrone_Lavery","surface_form":"Tyrone Lavery","offset":735},{"uri":"Hikuna_Judge","surface_form":"Hikuna Judge","offset":753},{"uri":"Species_description","surface_form":"species description","offset":778},{"uri":"Zaira","surface_form":"Zaira","offset":849},{"uri":"Vangunu","surface_form":"Vangunu","offset":869},{"uri":"Critically_endangered","surface_form":"critically endangered","offset":921},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":976},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":983},{"uri":"Deforestation","surface_form":"logging","offset":1042}]}
