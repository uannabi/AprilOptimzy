{"id":59919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In music, the dynamics in the piece is the variation in loudness between notes or phrases.\nIn written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels. They are listed in the table below. Notice that \u201Cpiano\u201D is pronounced the Italian way (\u201Cpi-AH-no\u201D), to tell it apart from the\nUse more than two \"p\"s or \"f\"s to show that the music is very, very soft, or very, very loud. Tchaikovsky sometimes used five \"p\"s or \"f\"s, though only up to three are normally found in sheet music.\nDynamic levels are not something that can be measured exactly. Exactly how loud \"mp\" should be depends on several things: what is happening in the music, the instrument, the size of the room in which the music is being played etc. The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another.\nSome composers are very precise about writing the dynamics they want. Others leave a lot to the performer to decide. Historically, composers several centuries ago, such as Bach, only wrote occasional dynamic marks. Even Mozart only wrote a few, mostly \"p\" and \"f\". By the 19th century composers were writing dynamics in much more detail in their music.\nSometimes accents are shown by marks similar to dynamic marks. \"Sforzando\" means a strong, sudden accent and is abbreviated as \"sf\", \"sfz\" or \"fz\". The notation \"sfzp\" (or \"sfp\") means a \"sforzando\" followed immediately by \"piano\"\nThe terms \"crescendo\", and \"diminuendo\" (or sometimes \"decrescendo\"), mean a gradual getting louder or softer. They can also be shown by signs known as \"hairpins\". A hairpin opening out is a \"crescendo\", one which closes is a \"diminuendo\".\nFor a quick change in dynamics, \"molto cresc.\" and \"molto dim.\" are often used (\"molto\" means \"a lot\"). For slow changes \"poco a poco cresc.\" and \"poco a poco dim.\" are used (\"poco a poco\" means \"little by little\", i.e. very gradually.)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":16},{"uri":"Musical_note","surface_form":"notes","offset":86},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":171},{"uri":"Tchaikovsky","surface_form":"Tchaikovsky","offset":429},{"uri":"Sheet_music","surface_form":"sheet music","offset":521},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Bach","offset":1026},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart","offset":1074},{"uri":"Accent_(music)","surface_form":"accents","offset":1217}]}
