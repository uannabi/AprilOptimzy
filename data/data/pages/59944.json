{"id":59944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Objectivity in science means that scientific measurement can be tested independent from the individual scientist (the subject) who proposes them.\nTo be properly considered objective, the results of measurement must be communicated from person-to-person, and then \"demonstrated\" for third parties, as an advance in understanding of the objective world. Such demonstrable knowledge would ordinarily confer demonstrable powers of prediction or technological construction.\nObjectivity in measurement.\nTo avoid the variety in subjective (equivocal) interpretation of quantifying terms such as \"green\", \"hot\", \"large\", \"considerable\", and \"negligible\", scientists strive, where possible, to eliminate human senses by use of standartized measuring tools (meter stick, stopwatch, thermometer, etc.) and mechanical/electronic measuring instruments (spectrometer, voltmeter, timer, oscilloscope, gravimeter, etc.) for performing the actual measuring process, eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers. The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units - so that everybody else understands them the same way. Where data must need be used, the ideal is to use \"hard\", \"objective\" criteria for assigning the classifications (see definition), such that different classifiers would produce the same assignments.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":28},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measurement","offset":58},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":761},{"uri":"Stopwatch","surface_form":"stopwatch","offset":774},{"uri":"Thermometer","surface_form":"thermometer","offset":785},{"uri":"Spectrometer","surface_form":"spectrometer","offset":853},{"uri":"Voltmeter","surface_form":"voltmeter","offset":867},{"uri":"Timer","surface_form":"timer","offset":878},{"uri":"Oscilloscope","surface_form":"oscilloscope","offset":885},{"uri":"Gravimeter","surface_form":"gravimeter","offset":899},{"uri":"Perception","surface_form":"perceptive","offset":986},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measurement","offset":1049},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":1100},{"uri":"Unit","surface_form":"unit","offset":1109},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigning","offset":1254},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"definition","offset":1289}]}
