It took place in Austin, Texas at University of Texas at Austin.\nSixteen people were killed in the incident. A 17th victim succumbed to his injuries in 2001.\nCharles Whitman was the mass murderer at the scene of the crime. It has been suggested that Whitman's violent impulses, with which he struggled for years, were caused by a tumor on his brain. Whitman had also killed his wife and mother.\nAfter the shootings, the observation deck was closed. The many bullet holes were repaired. The tower was closed again in 1975 after four suicides. It reopened in 1999 after security features were put up.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"School_shooting","surface_form":"school shooting","offset":51},{"uri":"Austin%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Austin, Texas","offset":116},{"uri":"University_of_Texas_at_Austin","surface_form":"University of Texas at Austin","offset":133},{"uri":"Charles_Whitman","surface_form":"Charles Whitman","offset":257},{"uri":"Mass_murder","surface_form":"mass murder","offset":281},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violent","offset":359},{"uri":"Tumor","surface_form":"tumor","offset":429},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":442}]}
