{"id":599560,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisleben","text":"Eisleben is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is famous as the hometown of Martin Luther; because of this, its official name is Lutherstadt Eisleben. In 2015, Eisleben had a population of 24,198.\nEisleben has two parts old town and new town (Altstadt and Neustadt). The new town was created for Eisleben's miners in the 14th century.\nEisleben was the capital of the district of Mansfelder Land and is the seat of the \"Verwaltungsgemeinschaft\" (\"collective municipality\") Lutherstadt Eisleben.\nHistory.\nEisleben was first written about in 997 as a market called Islebia, and in 1180 as a town. The counts of Mansfeld governed the area until the 18th century. In 1780, Eisleben came directly under the Electorate of Saxony. After the Napoleonic Wars, Eisleben became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. The Prussian Province of Saxony became part of the Free State of Prussia in the German Reich after World War I. After World War II, Eisleben became part of the new state of Saxony-Anhalt in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) until Germany's reuinification in 1990.\nHelfta.\nIn 1229, the Counts of Mansfield started a convent for women. At first, it was on the grounds of their castle. Then they built a separate convent at Helfta near Eisleben, which opened in 1258. It was governed under either the Benedictine or Cistercian model. It became known for its powerful and mystical abbesses, including Gertrude of Hackeborn, Gertrude the Great and Mechtild. However, Duke Albrecht of Brunswick destroyed the convent in 1342. It was rebuilt the next year. It closed in 1524, but later reopened on a smaller scale until 1542\nIn 1542, it came under the control of local farmers. In 1712 it became a farm run by the Prussian state. In 1994, the Catholic Diocese of Magdeburg bought the property and began restoring the building. Cistercian nuns from Seligenthal in Bavaria moved in starting in approximately 1999.\nMartin Luther.\nThe Protestant reformer Martin Luther was born in Eisleben on November 10, 1483. His father, Hans Luther, was a miner. Luther's family moved to Mansfeld when he was only a year old; he lived in Wittenberg most of his life. Luther preached his last sermon and died in Eisleben in 1546.\nEisleben started preserving its Luther memorials in 1689.\nIn 1997, Eisleben's \"Birth House\" and \"Death House\" were added to the World Heritage List. Also, Luther was baptised in Eisleben's St. Peter and Paul Church. He preached his last sermons at St. Andreas Church.\nHistorical population.\nThe population has been declining since the mid-1960s due to declining birth rates and people moving away. The municipal area has been enlarged several times by merging with neighboring districts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UNESCO World Heritage Site"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saxony-Anhalt","surface_form":"Saxony-Anhalt","offset":22},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":37},{"uri":"Martin_Luther","surface_form":"Martin Luther","offset":78},{"uri":"Mansfelder_Land_(district)","surface_form":"Mansfelder Land","offset":381},{"uri":"Verwaltungsgemeinschaft","surface_form":"Verwaltungsgemeinschaft","offset":421},{"uri":"Lutherstadt_Eisleben_(Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)","surface_form":"Lutherstadt Eisleben","offset":474},{"uri":"House_of_Mansfeld","surface_form":"counts of Mansfeld","offset":600},{"uri":"Electorate_of_Saxony","surface_form":"Electorate of Saxony","offset":703},{"uri":"Napoleonic_Wars","surface_form":"Napoleonic Wars","offset":735},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Prussia","offset":780},{"uri":"Province_of_Saxony","surface_form":"Province of Saxony","offset":813},{"uri":"Free_State_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Free State of Prussia","offset":851},{"uri":"German_Reich","surface_form":"German Reich","offset":880},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":918},{"uri":"Saxony-Anhalt","surface_form":"Saxony-Anhalt","offset":973},{"uri":"German_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"German Democratic Republic","offset":994},{"uri":"Convent","surface_form":"convent","offset":1118},{"uri":"Benedictine_order","surface_form":"Benedictine","offset":1301},{"uri":"Cistercian_order","surface_form":"Cistercian","offset":1316},{"uri":"Mysticism","surface_form":"mystical","offset":1371},{"uri":"Gertrude_of_Hackeborn","surface_form":"Gertrude of Hackeborn","offset":1400},{"uri":"Gertrude_the_Great","surface_form":"Gertrude the Great","offset":1423},{"uri":"Mechtild","surface_form":"Mechtild","offset":1446},{"uri":"Principality_of_Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel","surface_form":"Brunswick","offset":1482},{"uri":"Diocese_of_Magdeburg","surface_form":"Diocese of Magdeburg","offset":1748},{"uri":"Seligenthal","surface_form":"Seligenthal","offset":1844},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":1859},{"uri":"Protestant_Reformation","surface_form":"Protestant reformer","offset":1927},{"uri":"Martin_Luther","surface_form":"Martin Luther","offset":1947},{"uri":"Hans_Luther_(15th_century)","surface_form":"Hans Luther","offset":2016},{"uri":"Miner","surface_form":"miner","offset":2035},{"uri":"Mansfeld","surface_form":"Mansfeld","offset":2067},{"uri":"Wittenberg","surface_form":"Wittenberg","offset":2117},{"uri":"Martin_Luther%27s_Birth_House","surface_form":"Birth House","offset":2287},{"uri":"Martin_Luther%27s_Death_House","surface_form":"Death House","offset":2305},{"uri":"World_Heritage_List","surface_form":"World Heritage List","offset":2336},{"uri":"Baptism","surface_form":"baptised","offset":2374}]}
