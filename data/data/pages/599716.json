{"id":599716,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Bishop","text":"William Bradford Bishop Jr. (born August 1, 1936) is a former United States Foreign Service officer. He has been a fugitive from justice since allegedly killing five members of his family in 1976. On April 10, 2014, the FBI placed him on the list of its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.\nHis last posting, which began in 1974, was at State Department Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as an Assistant Chief in the Division of Special Activities and Commercial Treaties.\nBishop was born in Pasadena, California. He studied at UCLA and at Yale University.\nIn 1976, after getting upset for not getting a work promotion, Bishop bought a sledgehammer and a shovel and murdered his wife and three children as they slept at their home in Bethesda, Maryland. With the bodies loaded into the station wagon, Bishop allegedly drove, about a six-hour drive, to a densely wooded swamp off North Carolina Highway 94, about south of Columbia, North Carolina. He would later burn the bodies and bury them in near the swamp.\nBishop has been spotted several placed in Europe by former State Department employees in Italy, Stockholm and in Switzerland.\nIn 2011, it was believed that Bishop died in Hong Kong and later in France, these proved to be false. In 2014, the FBI exhumed the body of an Alabama man who was killed in a road accident in 1981, believing he was Bishop. After DNA of the man was tested it was revealed the dead man was not Bishop and that he remains alive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Foreign_Service","surface_form":"United States Foreign Service","offset":62},{"uri":"Fugitive","surface_form":"fugitive from justice","offset":115},{"uri":"FBI","surface_form":"FBI","offset":220},{"uri":"FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives","surface_form":"Ten Most Wanted Fugitives","offset":254},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":360},{"uri":"Pasadena%2C_California","surface_form":"Pasadena, California","offset":481},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Los_Angeles","surface_form":"UCLA","offset":517},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":529},{"uri":"Sledgehammer","surface_form":"sledgehammer","offset":625},{"uri":"Shovel","surface_form":"shovel","offset":644},{"uri":"Bethesda%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Bethesda, Maryland","offset":723},{"uri":"Station_wagon","surface_form":"station wagon","offset":775},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":858},{"uri":"North_Carolina_Highway_94","surface_form":"North Carolina Highway 94","offset":868},{"uri":"Columbia%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Columbia","offset":910},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":920},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1042},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1089},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":1096},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1113},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":1171},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1194},{"uri":"FBI","surface_form":"FBI","offset":1241},{"uri":"Exhumation","surface_form":"exhumed","offset":1245},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":1268},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":1354}]}
