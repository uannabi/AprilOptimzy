{"id":59986,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud","text":"e=\"preserve\">Fraud (or defrauding or scamming) is a crime in which someone tricks somebody else to get unfair or unlawful gain. Frauds are almost always about money, either directly or indirectly.\nA \"fraudster\" or a \"fraud\" is the person who commits the fraud. 'Fraudulence \" is the adjective, as in \"He tried to pass a fraudulent cheque\". To \"defraud\" someone is to commit a fraud against them.\nFraud is a criminal wrong: a fraudster may be prosecuted and imprisoned. It is also a civil wrong: a fraud victim may sue the fraudster to get compensation.\nAll societies have laws against fraud, but the details differ in each jusisdiction. In England an Act of Parliament defines three kinds of fraud.\nLesser cases are heard in a Magistrates' Court; more serious offences are tried in the High Court (jury proceedings).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":52},{"uri":"Criminal_law","surface_form":"criminal","offset":407},{"uri":"Civil_law","surface_form":"civil","offset":482},{"uri":"Jusisdiction","surface_form":"jusisdiction","offset":623},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":640},{"uri":"Act_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Act of Parliament","offset":651},{"uri":"Magistrates%27_Court","surface_form":"Magistrates' Court","offset":727},{"uri":"High_Court","surface_form":"High Court","offset":786},{"uri":"Jury","surface_form":"jury","offset":798}]}
