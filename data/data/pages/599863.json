{"id":599863,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_ending","text":"e=\"preserve\">Alternate ending is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the canonical narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.\nExamples in film.\nAlternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's DVD release. These alternative endings are a special type of deleted scene. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.\nSome films also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.\nExamples in television.\nIn TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canon_(fiction)","surface_form":"canonical","offset":252},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":485},{"uri":"Deleted_scene","surface_form":"deleted scene","offset":546}]}
