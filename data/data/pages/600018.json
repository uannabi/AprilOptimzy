He was also known for the proof of the Milnor conjecture and motivic Bloch-Kato conjectures and for the univalent foundations of mathematics and homotopy type theory.\nVoevodsky died on September 30, 2017 at his home in Princeton, New Jersey of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 51.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":76},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":84},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":93},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":123},{"uri":"Homotopy_theory","surface_form":"homotopy theory","offset":156},{"uri":"Algebraic_varieties","surface_form":"algebraic varieties","offset":176},{"uri":"Motivic_cohomology","surface_form":"motivic cohomology","offset":212},{"uri":"Fields_Medal","surface_form":"Fields Medal","offset":253},{"uri":"Milnor_conjecture","surface_form":"Milnor conjecture","offset":314},{"uri":"Bloch-Kato_conjectures","surface_form":"Bloch-Kato conjectures","offset":344},{"uri":"Univalent_foundations","surface_form":"univalent foundations","offset":379},{"uri":"Homotopy_type_theory","surface_form":"homotopy type theory","offset":420},{"uri":"Princeton%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Princeton, New Jersey","offset":494},{"uri":"Aortic_aneurysm","surface_form":"aortic aneurysm","offset":522}]}
