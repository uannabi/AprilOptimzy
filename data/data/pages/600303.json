{"id":600303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dragon Boat Festival is a yearly holiday in the People's Republic of China. It celebrates Qu Yuan, a writer and a government leader who lived a long time ago and died because he loved his country very much. The Dragon Boat Festival is always on the 5th day of the 5th month of China's old calendar, but\u2014because that calendar is based on changes in the moon and not the sun\u2014it is not always on the same day of the new calendar. The old calendar adds a 13th month when it is very different from the seasons, though, so the Dragon Boat Festival is always in late spring.\nName.\nIn Chinese, the Dragon Boat Festival is usually called \"Du\u0101nw\u01D4 Ji\u00E9\", which means the \"Holiday of Welcoming the Seventh\". This name is based on the old calendar, which used a group of 12 names as a kind of week. Chinese people write it \u7AEF\u5348\u7BC0 in traditional characters and \u7AEF\u5348\u8282 in simplified characters.\nHistory.\nA long time ago in China, this holiday may have celebrated the harvest of \"winter wheat\" or dragon gods with power over rivers and seas. By the time of Sima Qian, an important writer of history who lived around 100Before Christ, different people used the festival to remember Qu Yuan, Wu Zixu, or Cao E. Today, most Chinese people are taught that the holiday remembers Qu Yuan.\nQu Yuan was an important writer of poems who lived around 300. He lived at a time when the government of China was very weak and all its different parts began to say they were different countries. Qu Yuan's part was called Chu, and its king Xiong Huai was so powerful that he controlled Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and most of the places around them. King Huai listened to other leaders who said bad things about Qu Yuan and made him move to the countryside twice. King Huai also made other mistakes that also hurt Chu. The second time that Qu Yuan was sent away, he wrote a long poem about his sadness and then killed himself by walking into the Miluo River with a heavy stone. People don't agree about exactly why he did this but most think it was because of sadness for his country or a last try to make his king pay attention to his many mistakes.\nThe Republic of China celebrated the Dragon Boat Festival as to celebrate Qu Yuan and other Chinese writers.\nFor a long time, the People's Republic of China did not pay attention to the Dragon Boat Festival but, in 2005, it was one of three traditional Chinese holidays approved for celebration. Since 2008, it has been a national holiday.\nEvents.\nAll over China, people make and eat little pyramids of sticky rice called zongzis to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival. In southern China, some people also race dragon boats in rivers or in the sea. Both traditions are said to have started when local people ran to the Miluo River to throw zongzis around Qu Yuan's body to protect it from fish and dragons.\nThere are also some older traditions to get ready for the Chinese summer, like drinking rice wine with pesticides to avoid snakes and mosquitos. These are less common today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":43},{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"holiday","offset":50},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":65},{"uri":"Qu_Yuan","surface_form":"Qu Yuan","offset":107},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":131},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"died","offset":179},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":195},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":205},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":270},{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":285},{"uri":"Chinese_lunar_calendar","surface_form":"China's old calendar","offset":294},{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":333},{"uri":"Lunar_phase","surface_form":"changes","offset":354},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":369},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":386},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"new calendar","offset":430},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":514},{"uri":"Spring_(season)","surface_form":"spring","offset":577},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":594},{"uri":"Chinese_lunar_calendar","surface_form":"old calendar","offset":738},{"uri":"Earthly_branches","surface_form":"group of 12 names","offset":765},{"uri":"Week","surface_form":"week","offset":796},{"uri":"%E7%AB%AF%E5%8D%88%E7%AF%80","surface_form":"\u7AEF\u5348\u7BC0","offset":826},{"uri":"Traditional_characters","surface_form":"traditional characters","offset":833},{"uri":"%E7%AB%AF%E5%8D%88%E8%8A%82","surface_form":"\u7AEF\u5348\u8282","offset":860},{"uri":"Simplified_characters","surface_form":"simplified characters","offset":867},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":918},{"uri":"Harvest","surface_form":"harvest","offset":962},{"uri":"Winter_wheat","surface_form":"winter wheat","offset":974},{"uri":"Chinese_dragon","surface_form":"dragon","offset":991},{"uri":"Chinese_religion","surface_form":"gods","offset":998},{"uri":"Chinese_rivers","surface_form":"rivers","offset":1019},{"uri":"East_China_Sea","surface_form":"seas","offset":1030},{"uri":"Sima_Qian","surface_form":"Sima Qian","offset":1051},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":1085},{"uri":"Before_Christ","surface_form":"Before Christ","offset":1113},{"uri":"Qu_Yuan","surface_form":"Qu Yuan","offset":1175},{"uri":"Wu_Zixu","surface_form":"Wu Zixu","offset":1184},{"uri":"Cao_E","surface_form":"Cao E","offset":1196},{"uri":"Chinese_people","surface_form":"Chinese people","offset":1215},{"uri":"Qu_Yuan","surface_form":"Qu Yuan","offset":1277},{"uri":"Chinese_poetry","surface_form":"poem","offset":1312},{"uri":"Zhou_dynasty","surface_form":"government","offset":1368},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1382},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":1463},{"uri":"Chu","surface_form":"Chu","offset":1500},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":1513},{"uri":"King_Huai_of_Chu","surface_form":"Xiong Huai","offset":1518},{"uri":"Hubei","surface_form":"Hubei","offset":1564},{"uri":"Hunan","surface_form":"Hunan","offset":1571},{"uri":"Jiangxi","surface_form":"Jiangxi","offset":1578},{"uri":"Li_Sao","surface_form":"a long poem","offset":1845},{"uri":"Miluo_River","surface_form":"Miluo River","offset":1919},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":2128},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":2254},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":2426},{"uri":"National_holiday","surface_form":"national holiday","offset":2446},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":2515},{"uri":"Sticky_rice","surface_form":"sticky rice","offset":2527},{"uri":"Zongzi","surface_form":"zongzi","offset":2546},{"uri":"Dragon_boat","surface_form":"dragon boat","offset":2634},{"uri":"South_China_Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":2667},{"uri":"Miluo_River","surface_form":"Miluo River","offset":2742},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":2812},{"uri":"Dragon","surface_form":"dragon","offset":2821},{"uri":"Realgar_wine","surface_form":"rice wine with pesticide","offset":2918},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":2953},{"uri":"Mosquito","surface_form":"mosquito","offset":2964}]}
