Today farmers use it to irrigate their crops. Part of the canal is now underground. There are two large parks along the banks of the canal where it comes above the ground. One park is called the \"Parco della Vettabbia\". Near the park is a famous abbey called the \"Abbazia di Chiaravalle\". The abbey was built in the 12th century. The other park is called the \"Parco Ripamonti\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"canal","offset":70},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":100},{"uri":"Northern_Italy","surface_form":"northern Italy","offset":117},{"uri":"Ancient_Romans","surface_form":"ancient Romans","offset":137},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigate","offset":220},{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":300},{"uri":"Abbey","surface_form":"abbey","offset":442},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":512}]}
