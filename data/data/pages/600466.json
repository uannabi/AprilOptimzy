{"id":600466,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_kotoba","text":"e=\"preserve\">Yamato kotoba (kanji: \u5927\u548C\u8A00\u8449, hiragana: \u3084\u307E\u3068\u3053\u3068\u3070) are words that are native to the Japanese language. The word itself is also a native Japanese word, interestingly enough. Yamato kotoba can also be called by its Chinese based name, \"wago\" (kanji: \u548C\u8A9E, hiragana: \u308F\u3054). It is one of the three main sources of Japanese words, along with \"kango\" (kanji: \u6F22\u8A9E, hiragana: \u304B\u3093\u3054), or Chinese loanwords, and \"gairaigo\" (kanji: \u5916\u6765\u8A9E, hiragana: \u304C\u3044\u3089\u3044\u3054), or loanwords borrowed from languages other than Chinese (especially English since the post-WWII era).\nYamato kotoba in Japanese has much in common with native English words in that most of the everyday vocabulary comes from yamato kotoba, while Chinese loanwords words (much like Latin and French loanwords in English) are used for more formal situations (usually writing) and for specialized terms.\nHow to write \"yamato kotoba\".\nUsually, words with only one kanji are yamato kotoba, such as \"katana\" (kanji: \u5200, hiragana: \u304B\u305F\u306A, meaning: sword), \"sakana\" (kanji: \u9B5A, hiragana: \u3055\u304B\u306A, meaning: fish), \"kami\" (kanji: \u7D19, hiragana: \u304B\u307F, meaning: paper), \"yama\" (kanji: \u5C71, hiragana: \u3084\u307E, meaning: mountain) \"te\" (kanji: \u624B, hiragana: \u3066, meaning: hand), and \"oyogu\" (kanji and hiragana: \u6CF3\u3050, hiragana only: \u304A\u3088\u3050, meaning: to swim). Most kanji (the Japanese version of Chinese characters) have two different kinds of pronunciation, on'yomi (the pronunciation of the kanji borrowed from Chinese) and kun'yomi (the native pronunciation of Japanese words that use the kanji). Yamato kotoba words use the kanji's kun'yomi.\nSince on'yomi came from Chinese monosyllables (words with only one syllable), they themselves are also only one syllable, and like Chinese, they can have a CV or CVC structure. For example, the on'yomi for the following kanji \u5200, \u9B5A, \u7D19, \u5C71, \u624B, and \u6CF3 are \"t\u014D, shi, san, shu, and ei.\" However, kun'yomi can have one or multiple syllables, and those syllables are usually a CV structure, like the examples given above.\nSince Japanese uses three different writing systems interchangeably, even yamato kotoba can be written in several different ways. For example, the word \"sushi\" can be written entirely in hiragana as \u3059\u3057, entirely in katakana as \u30B9\u30B7, in kanji as \u9BA8 or \u9B93, or in ateji (kanji used only to show a word's pronunciation and not its meaning) as \u5BFF\u53F8 or \u58FD\u53F8.\nKanji usually show the root meaning of the word. While nouns are usually written only with kanji, they can also be written in kana if they are very common words, like \"sushi\", or if their kanji is not well known, not part of the \"j\u014Dy\u014D kanji\" (a standard list of 1,945 kanji all Japanese adults are expected to know) or too difficult to remember how to write, like \"bara,\" whose kanji is \u8594\u8587, but is usually only written as \u3070\u3089 in hiragana or as \u30D0\u30E9 in katakana.\nJapanese also invented many of its own kanji to name things that could be found in Japan, but not China (usually plants and animals). These are called \"kokuji\" (kanji: \u56FD\u5B57, hiragana: \u3053\u304F\u3058) meaning \"national characters\", or \"wasei-kanji\" (kanji: \u548C\u88FD\u6F22\u5B57, hiragana: \u308F\u305B\u3044\u304B\u3093\u3058) meaning \"Japanese-made Chinese characters\". \"Kokuji\" include the names of fish like \"iwashi\" (kanji: \u9C2F, hiragana: \u3044\u308F\u3057, meaning: sardine), \"tara\" (kanji: \u9C48, hiragana: \u305F\u3089, meaning: codfish), and \"kisu\" (kanji: \u9C5A, hiragana: \u304D\u3059, meaning: sillago), and trees like \"kashi\" (kanji: \u6A2B, hiragana: \u304B\u3057, meaning: evergreen oak), \"sugi\" (kanji: \u6919, hiragana: \u3059\u304E, meaning: Japanese cedar), and \"kaba\" or \"momiji\" (kanji: \u691B, hiragana: \u304B\u3070/\u3082\u307F\u3058, meaning: birch/maple). Most \"kokuji\" only have kun'yomi because they are \"yamato kotoba\", but some kanji also have on'yomi, like \u50CD (on'yomi: d\u014D \u3069\u3046, kun'yomi: hatara(ku) \u306F\u305F\u3089(\u304F), meaning: work), and some have only on'yomi, like \u817A (on'yomi: sen \u305B\u3093, meaning: gland).\n\"Yamato kotoba\" parts of speech.\nOther content words like verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are usually written in a combination of kanji and hiragana, where the root of the word is written in kanji and the inflectional morphemes (the parts of the word that don't change the central meaning of the word's root) are written in hiragana. For example, the native Japanes verb meaning \"to swim\" is \"oyogu\" in its plain form, where it is written as \u6CF3\u3050 in kanji and hiragana. The kanji \u6CF3 shows the verb's meaning, while \u3050 (gu) as in \"oyo-gu\" shows that the word is in its plain form. The polite form of \"to swim\" is \"oyogimasu\", which is written as \u6CF3\u304E\u307E\u3059 in kanji and hiragana. Once again, it has the same kanji, but it ends with different syllables \u304E\u307E\u3059 (gi-ma-su) as in \"oyo-gimasu\" to show that the word is in the polite form. Native Japanese adjectives usually end in with the syllable \u3044 (\"-i),\" like the word \"hayai\" (kanji and hiragana: \u901F\u3044, hiragana only: \u306F\u3084\u3044, meaning: fast), \"takai\" (kanji and hiragana: \u9AD8\u3044, hiragana only: \u305F\u304B\u3044, meaning: tall, high), and \"ookii\" (kanji and hiragana: \u5927\u304D\u3044, hiragana only: \u304A\u304A\u304D\u3044, meaning: big or large), while native Japanese adverbs are simply adjectives that end in \u304F (\"-ku\") rather than \u3044, like \"hayaku\u3000\"(kanji and hiragana: \u901F\u304F, hiragana only: \u306F\u3084\u304F, meaning: quickly).\nNouns based on adjectives end with the syllable \u3055 (\"-sa\"), as in \"hayasa\" (kanji and hiragana: \u901F\u3055, hiragana only: \u306F\u3084\u3055, meaning: speed), \"takasa\" (kanji and hiragana: \u9AD8\u3055, hiragana only: \u305F\u304B\u3055, meaning: height), and \"ookisa\" (kanji and hiragana: \u5927\u304D\u3055, hiragana only: \u304A\u304A\u304D\u3055, meaning: size/largeness).\nSometimes, native Japanese nouns can be written with multiple kanji. These are usually proper nouns like family names or place names. Japanese family names are usually \"yamato kotoba\", like Tanaka (kanji: \u7530\u4E2D, hiragana: \u305F\u306A\u304B), Yamamoto (kanji: \u5C71\u672C, hiragana: \u3084\u307E\u3082\u3068), and Kobayashi (kanji: \u5C0F\u6797, hiragana: \u3053\u3070\u3084\u3057). Most Japanese place names are also \"yamoto kotoba\", like \u014Csaka (kanji: \u5927\u962A, hiragana: \u304A\u304A\u3055\u304B), Ehime (kanji: \u611B\u5A9B, hiragana: \u3048\u3072\u3081), and Hiroshima (kanji: \u5E83\u5CF6, hiragana: \u3072\u308D\u3057\u307E), although there are also plenty of Japanese places with Chinese-based names, like T\u014Dky\u014D (kanji: \u6771\u4EAC, hiragana: \u3068\u3046\u304D\u3087\u3046), Mt. Fuji or \"Fuji-san\" (kanji: \u5BCC\u58EB\u5C71, hiragana:\u3075\u3058\u3055\u3093), and Honsh\u016B (kanji: \u672C\u5DDE, hiragana: \u307B\u3093\u3057\u3085\u3046).\nWhile usually cardinal numbers (numbers for measuring things) in Japanese are based off of Chinese words, most ordinal numbers (numbers for ordering things) and even certain measure words use native Japanese words.
