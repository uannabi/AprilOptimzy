{"id":600717,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberland","text":"Liberland, officially called the Free Republic of Liberland, is a sovereign state that started on an unclaimed piece of land on the western part of the Danube River between Croatia and Serbia. Liberland was founded on 13 April 2015 by Czech libertarian activist V\u00EDt Jedli\u010Dka.\nThe official Liberland website says the nation was created on no-man's land (terra) that emerged because Croatia and Serbia have not been able to agree on their borders for over 25 years. This border dispute includes some areas to the east of the Danube which are claimed by both Serbia and Croatia. Croatia considers some areas on the west side of the river, including Liberland, to be part of Serbia, although Serbia no longer claims that land.\nThe land is under de facto administration by Croatia since the Croatian War of Independence but Croatia has blocked people's access to Liberland since shortly after its founding. Croatia has also prevented Croatian citizens and other EU citizens from visiting the area. Before that, just about anyone could visit the area.\nNo country that is a member of the United Nations has recognized Liberland, although Liberland has opened official relations with Somaliland as well as other partially recognized and unrecognized states and micronations.\nLocation.\nThe border disagreement along the Danube River valley started in 1947 but was left unresolved during the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The disagreement got bigger after Yugoslavia broke up. Serbia thinks the thalweg of the Danube valley and the center line of the river is the international border between the two countries. The Croatia government disagrees and claims that the international border lies along the old lines of the cadastral municipalities located along the river \u2014 as the Danube was in the 19th century before meandering and hydraulic engineering works altered its course. As a result, Croatia claims a large part of the area controlled by Serbia, while Serbia does not claim the smaller parts on the other side.\nPresident Jedli\u010Dka says that the land they have claimed, known as \"Gornja\u00A0Siga\" (meaning \"upper tufa\"), was not claimed by either side.\nThe area is about, and most of it is covered with forests. A journalist from the Czech newspaper \"Parlamentn\u00ED listy\" who visited the area in April 2015 found a house that had been abandoned for about thirty years, according to people living in the vicinity. The access road was reported to be in a bad condition.\nThe Danube River, an international waterway with free access to the Black Sea for several landlocked nations, runs along the self-proclaimed territory. Liberland visitors and citizens come to the area by boat from Apatin, Serbia and other ports and docks along the Danube River. Liberland keeps its ships the Bitcoin Freedom and the SS Liberty at the local marina and has bought land and buildings located in the Apatin Free Trade Zone.\nProclamation.\nThe flag ceremony in Gornja Siga was performed by V\u00EDt Jedli\u010Dka and his associates on the same day Liberland was proclaimed.\nThe flag consists of a yellow background (symbolizing libertarianism) with a black horizontal stripe through the centre (symbolizing anarchy or rebellion) and the coat of arms in the centre. Jedli\u010Dka is a member of the Czech Party of Free Citizens, which bases its values on the classical liberal ideology.\nJedli\u010Dka stated that neither Serbia, Croatia nor any other nation claims the land (no-man's land or \"terra nullius\"). The border, he argued, was defined according to both Croatian and Serbian border claims and did not interfere with any other state's sovereignty. Jedli\u010Dka said in April 2015 that an official diplomatic note would be sent to both Croatia and Serbia, and later to all other states, with a formal request for international recognition.\nOn 18 December 2015, President Jedli\u010Dka presented the first provisional government of Liberland and its Ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Interior and Justice as well as two vice presidents.\nAccess to Liberland.\nCroatian authorities have blocked access to the area since the beginning of May 2015.\nIn May 2015, V\u00EDt Jedli\u010Dka and his translator Sven Sambunjak were shortly detained by Croatian police after making an attempt to cross the border. Jedli\u010Dka spent one night in jail and then was convicted and ordered to pay a penalty for illegal crossing of the Croatian border but appealed the verdict. He claimed that there were at least three Liberland citizens inside the area, who came from Switzerland.\nLater that month, V\u00EDt Jedli\u010Dka was detained again. Initially, reporters were able to enter the area with Jedli\u010Dka but subsequently they were also denied entry, including journalists from the Serbian public broadcast service Radio Television of Vojvodina, and from the Bosnian newspaper \"Dnevni Avaz\".\nThe people arrested were from many countries, including Ireland, Germany, Denmark, and the US. Croatian police have continued arresting people, including those who entered the area by boat via the international waterway. One of them, a Danish activist Ulrik Gr\u00F8ssel Haagensen, was placed in house arrest for 5 days before being sentenced to 15 days of prison, triggering some protests in Denmark.\nIn May 2016, several appeals court decisions from Croatia were published. The court upheld the rulings that crossing into Liberland from Croatia is illegal, but found the convictions for entering Liberland from Serbia were not correct. The court said that the lower court committed \"a fundamental breach of misdemeanor proceedings\" and \"essential procedural violations\". It further ruled that \"the facts were incorrectly and incompletely established [by the prosecutor] which could lead to misapplication of substantive law\". A retrial was ordered in 6 of the 7 appeals. The lower court is required to determine the location of the border and the border crossing, but has not done this yet. Since that time, visitors have come the area in boats, but have not permanently settled the area.\nLegality.\nCroatia and Serbia dismissed Jedli\u010Dka's claims as not important, although the two countries reacted in different ways. On 24 April 2015, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while they consider the affair a trivial matter, the \"new state\" does not infringe upon the Serbian border, which they say is the Danube River. Croatia, which blocks people from accessing Liberland, has stated that after international arbitration, it should be awarded to Croatia or Serbia, not to a third party.\nAn article in the Chicago Journal of International Law, the law review of the University of Chicago Law School, examined Liberland's claim to statehood in light of the criteria laid out by the Montevideo Convention. According to the author, \"Croatia\u2019s insistence that Liberland is part of Serbia could constitute a renunciation of Croatia\u2019s legal rights to Liberland. Conversely, if the territory that Liberland claims as its own is Serbian, the Serbian government\u2019s renunciation of its title to that land could also be a quitclaim that would transform the legal status of the land to \"terra nullius\". In both instances, the territory would belong to the first entity \u2014in this case Liberland\u2014 to claim it.\u201D\nReactions.\nLegal experts in Serbia and Croatia have asked if, under international law, Jedli\u010Dka has the right to claim the area, which is currently the subject of a dispute between the two nations but claimed by neither one. Journalists have been uncertain as to how serious Jedli\u010Dka is about his claims, with some calling it a publicity stunt.\nOn 20 May 2015 Petr Mach, the leader of the Party of Free Citizens, expressed support for the creation of a state based on ideas of freedom, adding that the Party of Free Citizens wants the Czech Republic to become a similarly free country.\nGoran Vojkovi\u0107, professor of law and columnist from the Croatian news portal \"Index.hr\", described Liberland as a \"circus which threatens Croatian territory\", and argued that there was a risk that Croatia's claim to control land on the other side of the Danube may be weakened by the attention that the Liberland project has drawn to the border dispute.\nIn 2016, an article in Stratfor summarized the initiative as follows: \"Liberland is a curious case because, in principle, none of the actors that could claim control over it seems interested in doing so. But this will probably remain a curiosity with negligible consequences at the international level. For the rest of the world's disputed territories, violence and diplomacy will remain the main tools to claim ownership.\nCitizenship.\nAccording to its web page, Liberland is currently looking for those who have respect for other people and respect the opinions of others, regardless of their race, ethnicity, orientation, or religion, have respect for private ownership which is untouchable, and have not been punished for serious criminal offences. Liberland received 200,000 applications in a week. In the beginning of May 2015, Liberland accepted around thirty citizens. An event was supposed to take place in the claimed territory, but Croatian border police stopped the group from entering it from the Croatian side. As of October 2017, Liberland has awarded citizenship to between 300 and 400 people, to persons who have \"helped move the country forward\" or earned at least 5000 Merits. On February 16, 2018, former Congressman Ron Paul was presented with a Liberland passport and citizenship certificate by Jedli\u010Dka and his cabinet.\nLiberland also presents an Order of Merit award called the \"First Class Order of Merit\" to persons who have contributed to the development of Liberland or to the ideas of freedom. Recipients have included publisher Steve Forbes, economist Mark Skousen, Croatian Member of Parliament Ivan Pernar, and others.\nThe Liberland constitution has been drafted and revised several times. The draft consists of four chapters. It includes a Bill of Rights and regulates the public administration, the political institutions, the legislative power, and the judicial power.\nRecognition.\nThere has been no diplomatic recognition of Liberland by any member of the United Nations. However, Liberland has established relations with Somaliland, a self-declared state that proclaimed its independence from Somalia in 1991. Liberland and Somaliland signed a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2017 promising to establish closer relations and cooperate in the areas of technology, energy and banking.\nLiberland President Jedli\u010Dka and members of Liberland's provisional government make regular goodwill visits around the world to make the case for Liberland and to promote diplomatic and commercial ties to the project. In 2017, Jedli\u010Dka met with U.S. Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Sasse and the Democratic Shadow Senator from Washington, D.C. Paul Strauss as well as several other elected representatives in the United States. In February 2018, Jedli\u010Dka and his U.S. team went to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as well as Senator Lamar Alexander.\nLiberland has also established relations with the region of Savoie (Savoy), an independent and self-governed territory from the 11th century until 1860, when it was annexed to France. Today, Savosian people are a minority in their own territory and their claims are not taken into account by the government of France. Liberland has also begun dialogue with the region of Brittany (Bretagne), among others.\nOn 5th December 2018, UK Libertarian MEP Bill Etheridge and Paul Brothwood hosted an event for Liberland in the European Parliament to discuss its future.\nSupport from political parties.\nSince 2015, several minor freedom parties expressed support for the creation of Liberland. They are the Capitalist Party in Norway, the Libertarian Party (Spain), The Swiss Independence Party up! (Unabh\u00E4ngigkeitspartei), the Liberal Democratic Party (Turkey) (LDP) the Libertarian Party of Canada, the Libertarian Party (United States) and the UK Libertarian Party.\nStatements from other micronation projects.\nA few micronations have expressed support for the idea of Liberland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sovereign_state","surface_form":"sovereign
