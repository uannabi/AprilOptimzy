{"id":60077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Sharia, Sharia law or Islamic law is a set of religious principles which form part of the Islamic culture. The Arabic word \"shar\u012B\u02BFah\" () refers to the revealed law of God and originally meant \"way\" or \"path\".\nClassical sharia deals with many aspects of public and private life, including religious rituals, family life, business, crimes, and warfare. In former times, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists, who based their legal opinions on Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent. Some parts of sharia can be described as \"law\" in the usual sense of that word, while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will.\nModern countries in the Muslim world all have their own laws. In most of them only a small part of the legal system is based on classical sharia. Muslims disagree on how sharia should be applied in the modern world.\nMeaning and origins of the word.\nPeople of different religions who speak Arabic use the word \"shar\u012B\u02BFah\" to describe a religious tradition that comes from teachings of prophets. Christians and Jews in the Middle East have used it to describe their own religion. For many Muslims the word \"sharia\" means simply \"justice\". They will say that any law agrees with sharia as long as it helps to build a more fair and prosperous society.\nMost Muslims think that sharia should be interpreted by experts in Islamic law. In Arabic, the word \"shar\u012B\u02BFah\" refers to God's revelation, which does not change. In contrast, the rules of behavior created by scholars as they try to understand God's revelation are called \"fiqh\". These rules can change and Islamic scholars have often disagreed about them.\nScholars disagree about the origins of the word \"sharia\". Some say that \"sharia\" comes from the old Arabic word meaning \"pathway to be followed\". This would make it similar to \"halakha\" (the way to go), the Hebrew word for Jewish law. Other scholars think that the word \"sharia\" originally meant \"path to the water hole\". They say that knowing the way to a water hole could save a man's life in the dry deserts where many Arabs lived in ancient times, and that is why this word came to refer to God's guidance to man.\nClassical legal theory.\nSharia in Islam is viewed as the revealed law of God, which cannot be altered. On the other hand, its interpretation, called \"fiqh\", is the work of legal scholars, who have frequently differed in their legal opinions. Some parts of sharia are similar to what people in the West call \"law\", while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will.\nThere are several schools of legal thought in Islam, of which the most important are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islam and the Ja'fari school of Shia Islam.\nActs of worship.\nThere are two festivals that are considered Sunnah.\nDietary laws.\nIslamic law lists only some specific foods and drinks that are not allowed.\nWhile Islamic law prohibits already-dead meat, this does not apply to fish and locusts. Also, hadith literature prohibits beasts having sharp canine teeth, birds having claws and talons in their feet, tamed donkeys, and any piece cut from a living animal.\nSacrifice.\nThere are some specific rules regarding the killing of animals in Islam.\nCrime and punishment.\nAlthough there is some disagreement about which crimes are \"hudud\" crimes, they usually include theft, highway robbery, zina (sex with forbidden partners), falsely accusing someone of \"zina\", and drinking alcohol. The prescribed punishments for these crimes range from 80 lashes to death. However, classical jurists developed very strict rules which restrict when these punishments could be applied, so that in many cases it became almost impossible to convict anyone under these rules. For example, there must be four adult male Muslim witnesses to a hudud crime or a confession repeated four times, before someone can be punished. If a criminal could not be convicted of a \"hudud\" crime, they could still receive a \"tazir\" punishment.\nMurder, bodily injury and property damage - intentional or unintentional - is considered a civil dispute under sharia law. The victim, victim's heir(s) or guardian is given the option to either forgive the offender, demand Qisas (equal retaliation) or accept a compensation (Diyya). Under sharia law, the Diyya compensation received by the victim or victim's family is in cash.\nApostasy is punished by death unless the apostate agreed to return to Islam.\nMuftis.\nDuring the Islamic Golden Age, sharia was interpreted by experts in Islamic law (\"muftis\"), most of whom were independent religious scholars. Anyone could ask them a question about law, and they were expected to give an answer for free. Their legal opinions were called \"fatwas\".\nQadi's courts.\nWhen there was a legal dispute about family or financial matters, it would be handled in a court headed by a \"qadi\" (judge). These judges also had a legal education, and they were appointed to their post by the ruler. In simple cases, qadis would pronounce a verdict based on their own knowledge of sharia. In more difficult cases, they would express the details of the case in general terms and ask a mufti for his legal opinion.\nMazalim courts.\nCriminal cases were usually handled in \"ma\u1E93\u0101lim\" courts. These courts were controlled by the ruler's council. \"Mazalim\" courts were supposed to follow \"the spirit of sharia\". Qadis and muftis were present in those courts to make sure the verdicts did not go against it. However, these courts did not necessarily follow the letter of the law, and they had fewer legal restrictions than qadi's courts. \"Mazalim\" courts also handled complaints against government officials. Their purpose of \"mazalim\" courts was to \"right wrongs\" which could not be addressed through procedures of qadi's courts. Less serious crimes were often handled by local police and market inspectors according to local customs, which were only loosely related to sharia.\nNon-Muslims.\nNon-Muslim communities living under Islamic rule were allowed to follow their own laws. The government kept out of their internal legal affairs, except when there was a dispute between people of different religions. Such cases were handled by a qadi. When that happened, sharia rules gave Muslims some legal advantages over non-Muslims. However, non-Muslims often won cases against Muslims and even against high government officials, because people thought that sharia was a reflection of divine justice which should defend the weak against the powerful.\nSharia in the modern world.\nIn the modern era, most parts of the Muslim world came under influence or control of European powers. This led to major changes in the legal systems of these lands. In some cases, this was because Muslim governments wanted to make their states more powerful and they took European states as models of what a modern state should look like. In other cases, it was because Europeans who colonized these lands forced them to abandon parts of Islamic law and follow European laws instead.\nEarly legal reforms.\nIn modern times, criminal laws in the Muslim world were widely replaced by codes which were inspired by European laws. Court procedures and legal education were also made similar to European practice. The constitutions of most Muslim-majority states mention sharia in one way or another. However, the classical rules of sharia were preserved mostly in family laws. In earlier times, sharia was interpreted by independent scholars who often disagreed with each other, and all their opinions were never written down in one place. In the modern era, it was the government who controlled the laws. Different states created their own legal codes, where the laws were clearly stated. The governments wanted to make family laws fit better in the modern world, but they still wanted people to view them as laws based on sharia. In order to do this, the scholars who wrote down these laws decided to pick and choose rules from the different legal opinions available in the classical books of law. When some of the laws they picked disagreed with the current norms of society, the government tried to solve this problem by creating additional court procedures. For example, when family laws in some states seemed to treat women unfairly to the population, the government created procedures that made it more difficult for men to take advantage of these laws in an unfair manner.\nRecent legal reforms.\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, many Muslims around the world became disappointed in their governments. These governments had adopted Western ways in their legal systems and other matters, but many people regarded their actions as oppressive, corrupt, and ineffective. More and more Muslims started to think that things would improve if their government returned to Islamic traditions. They began calling for return of sharia, and conservative members of the public wanted the government to deal with crime using all the traditional methods, including \"hudud\" punishments. In a few countries, the government put some elements of classical criminal law into the legal code. However, in some of these countries (for example, Iran and Sudan) the supreme court has rarely approved the harsher \"hudud\" punishments, while in the other countries which adopted \"hudud\" laws (for example, Pakistan and Nigeria), the supreme court never approves them.\nIn some countries, progressive Muslim reformers have been able to change how the state interprets sharia family laws to make them more fair to women.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is an exceptional case in the legal history of the Muslim world. It has always continued to use sharia in different areas of law, and it never codified its laws. Its judges have always tried to follow traditional sharia rules for dealing with crimes, and they often impose harsh punishments that inspire international protests. However, these punishments are not necessarily prescribed by sharia. Judges in Saudi Arabia follow the classical principle which says that \"hudud\" punishments should be avoided if at all possible, and the punishments which they apply are usually \"tazir\" punishments which are left to their own choice. Saudi Arabia is often criticized for its public executions, and their frequency has increased in recent decades. Executions became more frequent because the government and courts decided to crack down on violent crime which became more frequent during the 1970s, as also happened in the U.S. and China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":104},{"uri":"Qur%27an","surface_form":"Qur'an","offset":463},{"uri":"Hadith","surface_form":"Hadith","offset":471},{"uri":"Precedent","surface_form":"precedent","offset":522},{"uri":"Sunnah","surface_form":"Sunnah","offset":2887},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":3055},{"uri":"Locust","surface_form":"locust","offset":3064},{"uri":"Hadith","surface_form":"hadith","offset":3079},{"uri":"Zina","surface_form":"zina","offset":3467},{"uri":"Fatwa","surface_form":"fatwa","offset":4818}]}
