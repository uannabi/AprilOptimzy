{"id":600786,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupper_Lake_(town)%2C_New_York","text":"Tupper Lake is a town in Franklin County, New York. In 2010, 5,971 people lived in the town.\nThe settlement began around 1844. The village was settled during the town's lumber production period and grew after it gained railroad service. The early village was composed of two parts, Tupper Lake proper and Faust. The town for a time held the distinction as the top lumber producer in the state.\nThe great fire of 1899 burned more than 169 structures in the village, two-thirds of them being homes. The modern village grew out of this destruction and added all the amenities of a modern community earlier than many other villages in the state. Tupper had its own department store and synagogue, and its sprawling railway yards, driven by the lumber trade, made it a hub for the surrounding Adirondack communities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":17},{"uri":"Franklin_County%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Franklin County","offset":25},{"uri":"New_York_State","surface_form":"New York","offset":42}]}
