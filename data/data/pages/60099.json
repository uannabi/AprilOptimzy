{"id":60099,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism","text":"Alcoholism is addiction to alcohol. People who have alcoholism are called alcoholics.\nAlcoholism is a disease. It often gets worse over time, and can kill a person. However, alcoholism can be treated.\nAlcohol is the most commonly used drug in the world. Around the world, there are at least 208 million people with alcoholism.\nAlcoholism is a condition with a social stigma. Because of this, alcoholics often feel ashamed of their drinking. They may try to hide their drinking, avoid getting help, or refuse to believe that they are alcoholics, because they are too ashamed.\nDiagnosis.\nBeing an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol. It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink. No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking.\nThere is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic. There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person \"may\" be an alcoholic. These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers).\nProblems in the body.\nIf a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning. This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death.\nIn 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world. This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use.\nAlcohol withdrawal.\nIf an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal.\nThe most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called \"DTs\"). Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Many people who get the DTs die from them.\nThis does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking. It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking. Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking.\nEpidemiology.\nIn 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world. (This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.) In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world. This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics.\nAround the world.\nPeople in developed countries drink the most alcohol.p.4\nAlcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Here is a list of all the areas in the world. It is in order from the areas where alcoholism is most common to the areas where it is least common:p.21\nThere are many reasons why alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Some of these reasons include religion, culture, laws, and people's attitudes about drinking. For example, on average, people in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and islands in the Indian Ocean drink less than people anywhere else in the world.p.4 These are areas where many people are Muslims. Many Muslims in these areas do not drink any alcohol, because the Koran says not to.p.4 In some of these countries, drinking alcohol is illegal.\nHowever, in other areas, like Western Europe, alcohol is a part of daily life. It is legal and easy to get. People very commonly drink alcohol with meals. Very few people drink no alcohol. People's attitudes about alcohol are very different than attitudes in mostly Muslim countries. This is an example of how differences in religion, culture, laws, and attitudes about drinking can affect the amount of alcohol use and alcoholism in different areas.\nMen and women.\nAlcoholism is more common in men than in women. However, in the past few decades, the number of female alcoholics has increased.\nFemale alcoholics are most common in the Americas and Europe. In the United States and Western Europe, five to ten percent of women will become alcoholics at some point in their lives.\nIn the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific areas, less than 1% of women are alcoholics. In Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean area, almost no women are alcoholics.p.21\nYoung people.\nIn many countries, young people are using more and more alcohol. In a 2008 WHO survey, underage drinking had increased in 71% of countries. Drinking by young adults (ages 18-25) had increased in 80% of countries.p.10\nTreatment options.\nAlcoholism can be treated. There are many forms of treatment for alcoholism.\nDetoxification.\nDetoxification (detox) is often the first step in treating alcoholism. \"Detoxification\" means \"getting toxins out of the body.\" Alcohol detoxification means that the alcoholic stops drinking, so that alcohol (a toxin) can get out of their body. The alcoholic also needs to give their body time to recover from not having alcohol any more.\nIt is not safe for an alcoholic to suddenly stop drinking on their own. The safest way to stop drinking is to go to a hospital that specializes in alcohol detoxification. These hospitals are often called \"detoxes\" or \"rehabs.\" These places can make sure that an alcoholic has a safe detox. They can also give medications to make the alcoholic more comfortable, and to prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The most common medications that doctors give during alcohol detox are benzodiazepines.p.35\nOnce a person stops drinking alcohol, they are called \"sober\". Most people need other treatments to help them stay sober.\nDetox can be an intense process, and some people experience very strong emotions during it. This is complicated by the fact that, in the past, they may have used drugs or alcohol to help them handle strong emotions. In detox, the therapist helps them manage their emotions.\nMedications.\nSome medications can help alcoholics stay sober. These medications include:pp.130-144\nVitamins.\nMany alcoholics do not have enough vitamins in their body. This can cause serious problems. For example, if an alcoholic does not have enough thiamine, they can get brain damage. Often, alcoholics are treated with thiamine to prevent brain damage. They may also be given other vitamins if needed.p.144\nGroups for alcoholics.\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the biggest support and mutual aid group for alcoholics in the world. This means that in AA groups, alcoholics come together to support each other and help each other recover. AA uses a twelve-step program. This program is meant to help alcoholics fix the problems their alcoholism has caused.\nHelp for alcoholism.\nGroups for alcoholics and their families","categories":[],"infobox_types":["disease"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Addiction","surface_form":"addiction","offset":14},{"uri":"Alcoholic_drink","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":27},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":102},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":235},{"uri":"Social_stigma","surface_form":"social stigma","offset":360},{"uri":"Shame","surface_form":"ashamed","offset":414},{"uri":"Denial","surface_form":"refuse to believe that they are alcoholics","offset":501},{"uri":"Blood_test","surface_form":"blood test","offset":846},{"uri":"CAGE_questionnaire","surface_form":"CAGE questionnaire","offset":1048},{"uri":"Adults","surface_form":"adults","offset":1072},{"uri":"CRAFFT_Screening_Test","surface_form":"CRAFFT Screening Test","offset":1088},{"uri":"Teenagers","surface_form":"teenagers","offset":1115},{"uri":"Alcohol_poisoning","surface_form":"alcohol poisoning","offset":1203},{"uri":"Coma","surface_form":"coma","offset":1257},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":1311},{"uri":"Alcohol_withdrawal","surface_form":"alcohol withdrawal","offset":1515},{"uri":"Delirium_tremens","surface_form":"delirium tremens","offset":1582},{"uri":"Medical_emergency","surface_form":"medical emergency","offset":1643},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":1808},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":1826},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"medication","offset":1879},{"uri":"World_Health_Organization","surface_form":"World Health Organization","offset":1979},{"uri":"Estimate","surface_form":"estimate","offset":2011},{"uri":"Developed_country","surface_form":"developed countries","offset":2362},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":2723},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":2733},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":2742},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":2803},{"uri":"Northern_Africa","surface_form":"Northern Africa","offset":2822},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":2860},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":2875},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":2980},{"uri":"Koran","surface_form":"Koran","offset":3055},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":3125},{"uri":"Western_Europe","surface_form":"Western Europe","offset":3164},{"uri":"Decade","surface_form":"decade","offset":3673},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":3798},{"uri":"Percent","surface_form":"percent","offset":3844},{"uri":"Survey","surface_form":"survey","offset":4177},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":4530},{"uri":"Benzodiazepine","surface_form":"benzodiazepine","offset":5245},{"uri":"Sober","surface_form":"sober","offset":5321},{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":5806},{"uri":"Thiamine","surface_form":"thiamine","offset":5913},{"uri":"Alcoholics_Anonymous","surface_form":"Alcoholics Anonymous","offset":6096},{"uri":"Twelve-step_program","surface_form":"twelve-step program","offset":6311}]}
