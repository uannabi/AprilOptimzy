Gardiner marked the beginning of 102 years of single-party rule by the True Whigs.\nUnder the 1986 Constitution, the president is directly elected by eligible voters to a six-year term, which may be renewed once. Overall, 22 individuals have served as president. On January 22, 2018, George Weah was sworn in as the twenty-fifth and current president.\nTerms.\nUnder the original 1847 Constitution, the president was elected to a two-year term, which was increased to four years on May 7, 1907.
