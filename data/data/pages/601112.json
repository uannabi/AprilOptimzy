The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power.\nBetween dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.\nThe source of the Tagus is the Fuente de Garc\u00EDa, in the Fr\u00EDas de Albarrac\u00EDn municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ib\u00E9rico, Sierra de Albarrac\u00EDn Comarca.
