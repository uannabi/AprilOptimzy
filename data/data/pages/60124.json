{"id":60124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powiat","text":"A county (Polish: \"powiat\", pronounced \"povyat\"; plural, \"powiaty\") is the Polish second-level unit of administration, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture in other countries. A county is part of a larger unit called a \"voivodship\" (in Polish, \"wojew\u00F3dztwo\". One would call it in English \"province\").\nNames.\nMost Polish counties are named after their capital city, or county seat.\nIf a county seat has a double-barreled name, as with \"Mak\u00F3w Mazowiecki,\" the county may become either \"Mak\u00F3w County\" or \"Mak\u00F3w-Mazowiecki County.\" Due, in all but the first case, to the existence, respectively, of two \"double-barreled\" county seats with the identical noun name, the corresponding adjectives \"bielski\",\" \"grodziski\",\" \"ostrowski\" and \"tomaszowski\" each denote \"two\" distinct counties.\nHistory and functioning.\nSome Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the \"urban county\" (\"powiat grodzki\"), similar in local administration and self-governance to \"land counties.\" An average county (the largest being the powiat of Bia\u0142ystok) comprises 5 \u2013 8 communes. The largest urban county, in terms of population and area, is the city of Warsaw.\nThe history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795.\nIn the 19th century, the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (\"Congress Poland\"), and as the Polish equivalent of the German \"Kreis\" in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Pozna\u0144.\nAfter Poland regained independence in 1918, the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland. \"Powiat\"s (counties) were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships, but were reintroduced in 1999. There are now 314 \"land counties\" (\"powiat ziemski\") and 65 \"urban counties\" (\"powiat grodzki\"), more formally \"municipalities with county status\" (\"miasto na prawach powiatu\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":10},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish","offset":75},{"uri":"Local_government","surface_form":"administration","offset":103},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":135},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":143},{"uri":"Prefecture","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":155},{"uri":"Voivodship","surface_form":"voivodship","offset":230},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":246},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":299},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":378},{"uri":"Mak%C3%B3w_Mazowiecki","surface_form":"Mak\u00F3w Mazowiecki","offset":445},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":659},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":688},{"uri":"Grodzisk_County","surface_form":"grodziski","offset":712},{"uri":"Ostr%C3%B3w_County","surface_form":"ostrowski","offset":726},{"uri":"Tomasz%C3%B3w_County","surface_form":"tomaszowski","offset":742},{"uri":"Powiat_of_Bia%C5%82ystok","surface_form":"powiat of Bia\u0142ystok","offset":1038},{"uri":"Warsaw","surface_form":"Warsaw","offset":1159},{"uri":"14th_century","surface_form":"14th century","offset":1234},{"uri":"Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth","surface_form":"Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth","offset":1329},{"uri":"1795","surface_form":"1795","offset":1420},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1433},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":1538},{"uri":"Congress_Poland","surface_form":"Congress Poland","offset":1555},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":1610},{"uri":"Kreis","surface_form":"Kreis","offset":1618},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Pozna%C5%84","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Pozna\u0144","offset":1648},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":1709},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":1777},{"uri":"1975","surface_form":"1975","offset":1824},{"uri":"Voivodship","surface_form":"voivodship","offset":1860},{"uri":"1999","surface_form":"1999","offset":1898}]}
