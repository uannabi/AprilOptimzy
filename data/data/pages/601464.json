The documents, some traced back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source to German journalist Bastian Obermayer.\nThe documents contain personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had been kept private. While offshore business tax activities are legal, reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Offshore","surface_form":"offshore","offset":134},{"uri":"Corporate_services","surface_form":"corporate service","offset":260},{"uri":"Mossack_Fonseca","surface_form":"Mossack Fonseca","offset":287},{"uri":"Bastian_Obermayer","surface_form":"Bastian Obermayer","offset":372},{"uri":"Financial","surface_form":"financial","offset":422},{"uri":"Shell_corporations","surface_form":"shell corporations","offset":618},{"uri":"Fraud","surface_form":"fraud","offset":679},{"uri":"Tax_evasion","surface_form":"tax evasion","offset":686},{"uri":"International_sanctions","surface_form":"international sanctions","offset":711}]}
