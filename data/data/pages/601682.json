Sphere Fluidics has been named one of the UK's top 50 disruptive SMEs by Real Business in 2015.\nHistory.\nSphere Fluidics Limited was originally established in 2010, by two chemistry professors of Cambridge University, namely, Professor Chris Abell and Professor Wilhelm Huck along with Dr. Frank F. Craig, an entrepreneur, and Dr. Maher Khaled, a Cambridge University Enterprise.\nIn 2013, Sphere Fluidics spun out of Cambridge University to a new research facility in Babraham Research Campus. In 2013, Sphere Fluidics won an award for academic spin-outs at the ACES awards.\nOverview.\nSphere Fluidics operates in various markets including biopharmaceutical discovery and development, anti-microbial screening, synthetic biology and genome editing of single cells.\nIn January 2017, Sphere Fluidics launched an e-commerce platform which had, microfluidic products, research instrument accessories, and microfluidic biochips, in its product line.\nIn July 2017, Sphere Fluidics won \u201CBest Investment in Life Sciences\u201D Award, in the event held by the UK Business Angels Association.\nFunding.\nSphere Fluidics has raised \u00A311 million as of 2017, from investors namely, 24 Haymarket, Amadeus Capital Partners, Greenwood Way Capital, University of Cambridge Enterprise, University of Cambridge, Parkwalk Advisors, Providence Investment Company, London Business Angels, Envestors, Angels5K, Cambridge Angels, Q-Ventures and a Japanese corporate investor.\nCyto-Mine Technology.\nCyto-Mine Technology is one of the patented products of Sphere Fluidics.\nCyto-Mine technology is the integrated device that is able to automatically perform single cell analysis, sorting, imaging and dispensing into individual wells of microtitre plates in a single compact system. Based on the research made by Professors Chris Abell and Wilhelm Huck, this biochip system can automatically process millions to billions of miniaturised tests in tiny picodroplets.\nAccording to the scientists at Sphere Fluidics, Cyto-Mine can perform millions of single-cell assays daily, offering up to a 100-fold improvement over conventional techniques, at lower capital and operational cost.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cambridge_University","surface_form":"Cambridge University","offset":417},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patented","offset":1721}]}
