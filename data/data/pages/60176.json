{"id":60176,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron","text":"A polyhedron (one polyhedron, many \"polyhedra\", or \"polyhedrons\") is a geometrical shape. It is a 3D shape with flat faces, and straight edges. Each face is a polygon surrounded by edges. Usually it is defined by the number of faces, or edges.\nTwo types of polyhedron are convex and concave. The line connecting any two points of a convex polyhedron is inside the polyhedron. The line connecting two points of a concave polyhedron may go outside the polyhedron.\nMathematicians do not agree on what makes a polyhedron. They do agree that there are five Platonic solids, which are regular polyhedra. On a regular polyhedron, all faces are the same and all vertices are the same.\nNaming.\nUsually, polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have. The first polyhedra are the tetrahedron, which is made of four triangles, pentahedron (five faces, can look like a four-sided pyramid), hexahedron (six faces, a cube if it is regular), heptahedron (seven faces) and octahedron (eight faces). Prisms, pyramids and other shapes can also be named according to how many faces they have.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometrical","offset":71},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":98},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":159},{"uri":"Convex_set","surface_form":"convex","offset":272},{"uri":"Platonic_solid","surface_form":"Platonic solid","offset":552},{"uri":"Tetrahedron","surface_form":"tetrahedron","offset":776},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":811},{"uri":"Pentahedron","surface_form":"pentahedron","offset":822},{"uri":"Hexahedron","surface_form":"hexahedron","offset":884},{"uri":"Cube","surface_form":"cube","offset":909},{"uri":"Heptahedron","surface_form":"heptahedron","offset":933},{"uri":"Octahedron","surface_form":"octahedron","offset":963},{"uri":"Prism_(geometry)","surface_form":"Prisms","offset":989},{"uri":"Pyramid_(geometry)","surface_form":"pyramids","offset":997}]}
