{"id":60184,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_calendar","text":"=\"preserve\">The Iranian calendar also known as Persian calendar or the Jal\u0101li Calendar is a solar calendar. It is currently used in Iran and Afghanistan. It is observation-based, rather than rule-based. Each year starts on the vernal equinox as precisely determined by astronomical observations from Tehran (or the 52.5\u00B0E meridian, which also defines IRST) and Kabul. This makes it more accurate than the Gregorian Calendar.\nThe current Iranian Calendar year is 1399 AP\" (AP = Anno Persico/Anno Persarum = Persian year)\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solar_calendar","surface_form":"solar calendar","offset":92},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":132},{"uri":"Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":141},{"uri":"Vernal_equinox","surface_form":"vernal equinox","offset":227},{"uri":"Tehran","surface_form":"Tehran","offset":300},{"uri":"Meridian_(geography)","surface_form":"meridian","offset":322},{"uri":"Iran_Standard_Time","surface_form":"IRST","offset":351},{"uri":"Kabul","surface_form":"Kabul","offset":361},{"uri":"Gregorian_Calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian Calendar","offset":405}]}
