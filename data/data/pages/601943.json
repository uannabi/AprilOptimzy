{"id":601943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_(United_States%2C_1971)","text":"The People's Party was a political party in the United States. The party was created by individuals from the Peace and Freedom Party, Human Rights Party, Liberty Union Party and a few more. Their goal was to present an anti-war platform for the upcoming election. The party ran in the 1972 and 1976 presidential elections. The party did not get more than 0.10% of the popular vote in both elections.\nIn the 1972 election, the party nominated pediatrician Benjamin Spock. Julius Hobson was his vice-presidential running mate. He supported universal health care, removing American troops from other countries (see non-interventionism) and the legalization of abortion and Marijuana. He received 0.10% of the popular vote, or 78,759 votes. In the 1976 election, the party nominated Margaret Wright, and Benjamin Spock ran as her vice-presidential running mate. In the end, she received 0.06% of the vote, or 49,013 votes.\nAfter the elections, the party wanted to become a coalition, but many of the founding parties dissolved, so the People's Party disbanded as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":48},{"uri":"Peace_and_Freedom_Party","surface_form":"Peace and Freedom Party","offset":109},{"uri":"Human_Rights_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Human Rights Party","offset":134},{"uri":"Liberty_Union_Party","surface_form":"Liberty Union Party","offset":154},{"uri":"Anti-war_movement","surface_form":"anti-war","offset":219},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":285},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_1976","surface_form":"1976","offset":294},{"uri":"Pediatrics","surface_form":"pediatrician","offset":442},{"uri":"Benjamin_Spock","surface_form":"Benjamin Spock","offset":455},{"uri":"Julius_Hobson","surface_form":"Julius Hobson","offset":471},{"uri":"Universal_health_care","surface_form":"universal health care","offset":538},{"uri":"Non-interventionism","surface_form":"non-interventionism","offset":612},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":657},{"uri":"Marijuana","surface_form":"Marijuana","offset":670},{"uri":"Margaret_Wright_(American_politician)","surface_form":"Margaret Wright","offset":779},{"uri":"Benjamin_Spock","surface_form":"Benjamin Spock","offset":800},{"uri":"Coalition","surface_form":"coalition","offset":969}]}
