{"id":602173,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1917_Browning_machine_gun","text":"The M1917 Browning machine gun is a .30-06 Springfield machine gun created by John Browning. It was used in World War I and in World War II. It is a heavy machine gun that weighed around 100 pounds with the tripod and 42 pounds without it.\nIt is a water-cooled machine gun, which allowed it to fire for a long period of time without it overheating. The water-cooling tank made it much heavier. During World War II, M1917 was mostly replaced by the M1919 because it was lighter and let soldiers move more quickly, but the M1917 was still used often.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":".30-06_Springfield","surface_form":".30-06 Springfield","offset":36},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":55},{"uri":"John_Browning","surface_form":"John Browning","offset":78},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":108},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":127},{"uri":"Heavy_machine_gun","surface_form":"heavy machine gun","offset":149},{"uri":"Tripod_(firearms)","surface_form":"tripod","offset":207},{"uri":"M1919_Browning_machine_gun","surface_form":"M1919","offset":448}]}
