{"id":602371,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Adrisi","text":"General Mustafa Adrisi (\u2013 28 July 2013) was Vice President of Uganda. He served from 1977 to 1978 and was one of President Idi Amin's closest allies. In 1978, after Adrisi was injured in a suspicious auto accident, troops loyal to him decided to rebel. Amin sent soldiers against the rebelling people, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. This led to the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War.\nIn the late 1990s, Mustafa Adrisi was living quietly in Arua, West Nile, in a house provided by the Ugandan government, and had recently gone back to complete his primary school certificate. He died in 2013.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"General","surface_form":"General","offset":0},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_Uganda","surface_form":"Vice President of Uganda","offset":44},{"uri":"Idi_Amin","surface_form":"Idi Amin","offset":123},{"uri":"Uganda%E2%80%93Tanzania_War","surface_form":"Uganda\u2013Tanzania War","offset":369}]}
