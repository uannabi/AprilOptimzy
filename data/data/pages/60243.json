{"id":60243,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom","text":"Christendom or the Christian world, in the widest sense, means Christianity as a territorial phenomenon. That means: those countries where most people are Christians and because of that are part of Christendom.\nPeople have used the term Christendom for the medieval and Renaissance understanding of the Christian world as one single \"Body of Christ\" with Christ as the head.
