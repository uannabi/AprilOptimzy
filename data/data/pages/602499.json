It was devastated by Hannibal, in the year 214 BC.\nToday, it is mostly known for its beaches. The best-known sight is the Piscina Mirabilis, a water reservoir, of about 70m by 30m which the Romans constructed to support the fleet.\nThe current landscape around Misenum is characterized by hills and crater lakes. It is the result of the volcanic activity of the Phlegraean Fields.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"commune","offset":39},{"uri":"Naples","surface_form":"Naples","offset":52},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":60},{"uri":"Bacoli","surface_form":"Bacoli","offset":92},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Naples","surface_form":"Gulf of Naples","offset":128},{"uri":"Cumae","surface_form":"Cumae","offset":205},{"uri":"Hannibal","surface_form":"Hannibal","offset":233},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":548},{"uri":"Phlegraean_Fields","surface_form":"Phlegraean Fields","offset":573}]}
