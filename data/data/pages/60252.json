{"id":60252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake","text":"William Blake (28 November 1757 \u2013 12 August 1827) was an English poet, visionary, painter, and printmaker. He was born in London and died there.\nDuring his lifetime he was not very well known. Today Blake's work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts. Blake's first collection of poems, \"Poetical Sketches\", was printed around 1783. His most famous poem \"And did those feet in ancient time\" was, over 100 years later, put to music by Hubert Parry. The hymn is called \"Jerusalem\".\nBlake was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest Britons organised by the BBC in 2002.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["writer"],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_poetry","surface_form":"poet","offset":65},{"uri":"Visionary","surface_form":"visionary","offset":71},{"uri":"Printmaker","surface_form":"printmaker","offset":95},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":262},{"uri":"Visual_arts","surface_form":"visual arts","offset":277},{"uri":"And_did_those_feet_in_ancient_time","surface_form":"And did those feet in ancient time","offset":393},{"uri":"Hubert_Parry","surface_form":"Hubert Parry","offset":472},{"uri":"100_Greatest_Britons","surface_form":"100 Greatest Britons","offset":556},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":594}]}
