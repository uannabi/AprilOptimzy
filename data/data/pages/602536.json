He moved to Norway when his father began working for a mine there and in later life became the founder of the Norwegian Pentecostal movement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hamlet_(place)","surface_form":"hamlet","offset":30},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":40},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":59},{"uri":"Civil_parish","surface_form":"civil parish","offset":88},{"uri":"Calstock","surface_form":"Calstock","offset":104},{"uri":"Gunnislake","surface_form":"Gunnislake","offset":184},{"uri":"Gunnislake_railway_station","surface_form":"Gunnislake railway station","offset":233},{"uri":"Tamar_Valley_Line","surface_form":"Tamar Valley Line","offset":281},{"uri":"Plymouth","surface_form":"Plymouth","offset":304},{"uri":"Drakewalls","surface_form":"Drakewalls","offset":391},{"uri":"Pentecostal","surface_form":"Pentecostal","offset":942},{"uri":"Thomas_Ball_Barratt","surface_form":"Thomas Ball Barratt","offset":961}]}
