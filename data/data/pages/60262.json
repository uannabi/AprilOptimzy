{"id":60262,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_lime","text":"Persian Lime (\"Citrus x latifolia\"), also known as Tahiti lime or Bearss lime is a kind of citrus fruit. It is the primary citrus fruit grown commercially in the U.S. It is sold simply as a \"lime\". The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter. Very often, it has slightly nippled ends. It is usually sold quite green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is larger, thicker-skinned, and less aromatic than the key lime. The key lime is grown more often worldwide. The Persian lime is bigger than the key lime, and has fewer seeds. The plant is also hardier, and has no thorns on the bushes. The fruit also has a longer shelf life.\nPersian limes are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavour. Persian limes are sold primarily in six sizes, known as 110's, 150's, 175's, 200's, 230's and 250's. They are grown primarily in Florida in the U.S. The Persian lime became more important when key lime orchards were wiped out by a hurricane in 1926. Persian lime orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed and exported every year primarily from Mart\u00EDnez de la Torre, Veracruz, Mexico, to the American, European and Asian markets. U.S. Persian lime imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen, Texas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Citrus_fruit","surface_form":"citrus fruit","offset":91},{"uri":"Citrus","surface_form":"citrus","offset":123},{"uri":"Lime","surface_form":"lime","offset":191},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":225},{"uri":"Key_lime","surface_form":"key lime","offset":416},{"uri":"Shelf_life","surface_form":"shelf life","offset":625},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":887},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":1002},{"uri":"Hurricane_Andrew","surface_form":"Hurricane Andrew","offset":1060},{"uri":"1992","surface_form":"1992","offset":1080},{"uri":"Veracruz","surface_form":"Veracruz","offset":1199},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1209},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1224},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1234},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":1247},{"uri":"McAllen","surface_form":"McAllen","offset":1327},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":1336}]}
