{"id":602643,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy","text":"Privacy is the ability of a person or group of people to hide information about themselves. It is also how people choose what information about themselves they want to share.\nMany countries have laws about privacy. Some laws and constitutions protect privacy, such as the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Other laws limit privacy. For example, taxation laws force people to share information about income with the government. Companies can also encourage people to share information about themselves in exchange for money or other benefits.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":62},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":229},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":272},{"uri":"Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","surface_form":"Universal Declaration of Human Rights","offset":307},{"uri":"Taxation","surface_form":"taxation","offset":385},{"uri":"Income","surface_form":"income","offset":439},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":455},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"Companies","offset":467}]}
