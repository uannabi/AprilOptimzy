{"id":602647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting","text":"=\"preserve\">Parenting is the process of helping a child develop into an adult.\nWhen a child is an infant, parenting involves providing food, comfort and cleaning, and allowing the infant to sleep. As infants cannot talk, this requires the parents to watch the child closely and to help the child learn language.\nAs the infant grows, parenting involves guiding and teaching the child. Parents establish habits such as brushing teeth and teach etiquette to behave in society.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":50},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":72},{"uri":"Infant","surface_form":"infant","offset":98},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":135},{"uri":"Comfort","surface_form":"comfort","offset":141},{"uri":"Cleaning","surface_form":"cleaning","offset":153},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":190},{"uri":"Talk","surface_form":"talk","offset":215},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":302},{"uri":"Infant","surface_form":"infant","offset":319},{"uri":"Habit","surface_form":"habit","offset":402},{"uri":"Etiquette","surface_form":"etiquette","offset":442}]}
