He made his cinematic debut in the 1984 drama \"Vetri\", directed by his father, S. A. Chandrasekhar. After appearing in Chandrasekhar's films as an child artist in nearly 9 films, Vijay made his debut as a lead actor with \"Naalaiya Theerpu\" (1992). He followed it with a supporting role opposite Vijayakanth in \"Sendhoorapandi\" (1993). Vijay went on to play lead roles in his father's directorial ventures such as \"Rasigan\" (1994) and \"Deva\" (1995).

His subsequent films \"Vasegara\" and \"Puthiya geethai\" did not do well at the box office. The success of his masala film \"Thirumalai\" (2003), where he was paired opposite Jyothika, changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero.
