{"id":602855,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value","text":"In statistics, a \"p\"-value is the probability that the null hypothesis (the idea that a theory being tested is false) gives for a specific experimental result to happen. \"p\"-value is also called probability value. If the \"p\"-value is low, the null hypothesis is unlikely, and the experiment has statistical significance as evidence for a different theory.\nIn many fields, an experiment must have a \"p\"-value of less than 0.05 for the experiment to be considered evidence of the alternative hypothesis. In short, a low p-value means a higher chance of the hypothesis being true.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":3},{"uri":"Probability","surface_form":"probability","offset":34},{"uri":"Null_hypothesis","surface_form":"null hypothesis","offset":55},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":88},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":139},{"uri":"Statistical_significance","surface_form":"statistical significance","offset":295},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":323}]}
