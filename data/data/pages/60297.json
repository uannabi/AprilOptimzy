{"id":60297,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid","text":"Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It can be found in citrus fruits (like oranges). It is used by organisms for Krebs cycle. It acts like a preservative when added to food. It is also used to add a sour (acidic) taste to foods and soft drinks. In the European Union it is known as E 330, as a food additive.\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons, in 1782. The substance was probably known to alchemists, perhaps with a different name. The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century. Citric Acid contains 6 Carbon atoms, 8 Hydrogen atoms and 7 Oxygen atoms. Its chemical formula is C6H8O7.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic","offset":22},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":30},{"uri":"Citrus_fruit","surface_form":"citrus fruit","offset":55},{"uri":"Krebs_cycle","surface_form":"Krebs cycle","offset":113},{"uri":"Preservative","surface_form":"preservative","offset":141},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":222},{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soft drink","offset":232},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":252},{"uri":"Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele","surface_form":"Carl Wilhelm Scheele","offset":309},{"uri":"Lemon","surface_form":"lemon","offset":379},{"uri":"Alchemist","surface_form":"alchemist","offset":432},{"uri":"Arabian","surface_form":"Arabian","offset":479},{"uri":"Geber","surface_form":"Geber","offset":497},{"uri":"9th_century","surface_form":"9th century","offset":549}]}
