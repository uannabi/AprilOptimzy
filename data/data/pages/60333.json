Although he said he was not interested in prose his short story \"Der arme Spielmann\" (\"The poor minstrel\") is probably the best known of his works and one of the best short stories of the 19th century. Grillparzer wrote the funeral speech for Beethoven's funeral in 1827.\nAn Austrian pastry is named after him: the Grillparzertorte.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":24},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":87},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":110},{"uri":"Trilogy","surface_form":"trilogy","offset":151},{"uri":"Golden_Fleece","surface_form":"Golden Fleece","offset":195},{"uri":"Prose","surface_form":"prose","offset":409},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short story","offset":419},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":555},{"uri":"Funeral","surface_form":"funeral","offset":591},{"uri":"Eulogy","surface_form":"speech","offset":599},{"uri":"Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven's","offset":610},{"uri":"Pastry","surface_form":"pastry","offset":651}]}
