{"id":60350,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BCr_Elise","text":"\"F\u00FCr Elise\" (German for \"For Elise\") is the common name of the \"Bagatelle in A minor\", written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810. The song is thought to be written for Therese, a woman that Beethoven wanted to marry in 1810, however his handwriting was misspelt undergoing transcription, allowing the piece to be known as Fur Elise rather the Fur Therese. Therese did not want to marry him.\nThe piece of music, which was written for the piano, was not published until 1865, a long time after Beethoven\u2019s death. It is one of the most well-known pieces of piano music in the world.\nForm.\nThe piece is in rondo form. There is a main section (A) which appears three times. Between these three sections there are two other sections (B and C), so the form of the piece can be described as: A B A C A.\nThe main section has a time signature of 3/8. It is based on arpeggios which flow from one hand to the other. This is the section that many beginner pianists want to play. The two middle sections are harder to play at the correct speed. They have fast scales, arpeggios and left hand demisemiquavers (32nd notes).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":13},{"uri":"Ludwig_van_Beethoven","surface_form":"Ludwig van Beethoven","offset":98},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":402},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":435},{"uri":"Rondo_form","surface_form":"rondo form","offset":600},{"uri":"Time_signature","surface_form":"time signature","offset":816},{"uri":"Arpeggio","surface_form":"arpeggio","offset":854},{"uri":"Scale_(music)","surface_form":"scales","offset":1045},{"uri":"Arpeggio","surface_form":"arpeggio","offset":1053}]}
