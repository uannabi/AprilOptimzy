Teplice (pronounced in Czech: \u201CTep-li-tse\u201D) is a famous spa town where, in earlier times, lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their health. Goethe, Beethoven, Chopin, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner all stayed there.\nTeplice lies between Prague and Dresden in a mountain area called Kru\u0161n\u00E9 hory (Iron Mountains). In the year 762 hot springs were found there. The waters from these springs helped people who were ill to get better so it became a spa town.\nSince 1990 many buildings have been restored. The Kru\u0161nohorsk\u00E9 divadlo (Kru\u0161nohorsk\u00E9 theatre) is now being refurbished. The North Bohemia Philharmonic Orchestra give concerts there in the open air.
