{"id":60385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol","text":"e=\"preserve\">The cytosol (also known as intracellular fluid (ICF) or cytoplasmic matrix, or groundplasm) is the internal fluid of the cell, and a part of cell metabolism occurs here.\nProteins within the cytosol play an important role in signal transduction pathways and glycolysis.\nCytosol mostly consists of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as protein). It contains about 20% to 30% protein.\nNormal human cytosolic pH is (roughly) 7.0 (i.e. neutral), whereas the pH of the extracellular fluid is 7.4.\nThe texture of cytosol being described as granular can be attributed to the fact that in order to study the texture, an electron microsope must be used, which requires a process of dehydration prior to study.\nReferences.\n\"Life: the science of biology\".
