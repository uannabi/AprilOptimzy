{"id":60389,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Fan fiction or fanfiction (also known as fanfic) is a name for fiction created by fans instead of the original author.\nFanfiction writers take fictional characters and settings from fictional (or sometimes historical) stories that were created by other people, and write original stories about them. People write fan fiction for many different book, television series, and movie fandoms.\nWhen fanfiction first began, it was often only published in fan magazines. Today fanfiction, like many fandom activities, can be usually found on the internet. This has created many fanfiction communities. People in these communities post their fanfiction and receive feedback (reviews) from other community members.\nThere is also fan art (also called fanart), which is often drawings or other visual art based on a fandom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":76},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":124},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":156},{"uri":"Fictional_universe","surface_form":"settings","offset":181},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":195},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":219},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"stories","offset":293},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":357},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":363},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":386},{"uri":"Fandom","surface_form":"fandom","offset":392},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":551}]}
