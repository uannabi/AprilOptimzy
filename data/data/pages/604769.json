{"id":604769,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(Saw_character)","text":"John Kramer\u2014known as The Jigsaw Killer or simply Jigsaw'\"\u2014is a fictional character who appears in the \"Saw\" franchise as the main antagonist.\nJigsaw made his appearance in the first movie of the series, \"Saw\", and he later appeared in \"Saw II\", \"Saw III\", \"Saw IV\", \"Saw V\", \"Saw VI\", \"Saw 3D\" and, eventually, \"Jigsaw\". He is played by American actor Tobin Bell.\nJigsaw ranks No. 30 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\" list.\nBackground.\nIn the series' narrative, Kramer is a former civil engineer dying from an inoperable frontal lobe tumor that had developed from colon cancer. After a failed suicide attempt, Kramer found a new appreciation for his life, and went to dedicate the rest of his life to inspiring the same appreciation in others by testing their will to live.\nTests.\nHis methods include forcing his subjects through deadly scenarios, which he referred to as \"games\" or \"tests\", in which they were forced to inflict pain upon themselves or others in order to escape. These tests were typically symbolic of what Jigsaw perceived as a flaw in each person's moral character or life. The Jigsaw name was given to him by the media for his practice of cutting a puzzle piece shape of flesh from those who fail.\nHis videos are recorded with a cheap homemade camera with Billy the Puppet instructing the subjects what to do to live.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saw_(franchise)","surface_form":"\"Saw\" franchise","offset":102},{"uri":"Antagonist","surface_form":"antagonist","offset":130},{"uri":"Saw_(2004_movie)","surface_form":"Saw","offset":204},{"uri":"Saw_II","surface_form":"Saw II","offset":236},{"uri":"Saw_III","surface_form":"Saw III","offset":246},{"uri":"Saw_IV","surface_form":"Saw IV","offset":257},{"uri":"Saw_V","surface_form":"Saw V","offset":267},{"uri":"Saw_VI","surface_form":"Saw VI","offset":276},{"uri":"Saw_3D","surface_form":"Saw 3D","offset":286},{"uri":"Jigsaw_(2017_movie)","surface_form":"Jigsaw","offset":312},{"uri":"Tobin_Bell","surface_form":"Tobin Bell","offset":352},{"uri":"Empire_(magazine)","surface_form":"Empire","offset":388},{"uri":"Civil_engineer","surface_form":"civil engineer","offset":502},{"uri":"Frontal_lobe","surface_form":"frontal lobe","offset":542},{"uri":"Tumor","surface_form":"tumor","offset":555},{"uri":"Colon_cancer","surface_form":"colon cancer","offset":585},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":614},{"uri":"Jigsaw_puzzle","surface_form":"puzzle","offset":1190},{"uri":"Billy_the_Puppet","surface_form":"Billy the Puppet","offset":1297}]}
