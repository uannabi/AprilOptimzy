He replaced Jim Cairns as Treasurer in 1975, but served for only five months.\nIn early 1977, Hayden challenged Whitlam for the party leadership and was defeated by just two votes. He replaced Whitlam as Leader of the Opposition at the end of the year when Whitlam resigned as a result of Labor's defeat at the 1977 election. He was replaced by Bob Hawke in 1983.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Governors-General_of_Australia","surface_form":"21st","offset":98},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_Australia","surface_form":"Governor-General of Australia","offset":103},{"uri":"Australian_Labor_Party","surface_form":"Labor Party","offset":189},{"uri":"Gough_Whitlam","surface_form":"Whitlam","offset":265},{"uri":"Bob_Hawke","surface_form":"Hawke Government","offset":277},{"uri":"Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":322},{"uri":"Jim_Cairns","surface_form":"Jim Cairns","offset":385},{"uri":"Treasurer_of_Australia","surface_form":"Treasurer","offset":399},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Australia)","surface_form":"Leader of the Opposition","offset":576},{"uri":"Australian_federal_election%2C_1977","surface_form":"1977 election","offset":683},{"uri":"Bob_Hawke","surface_form":"Bob Hawke","offset":717}]}
