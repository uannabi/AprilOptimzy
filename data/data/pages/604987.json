{"id":604987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formic_acid","text":"Formic acid, or methanoic acid'\", is the simplist carboxylic acid and has the chemical formula. Many animals use for defence. The word \"formic\" comes from the Latin word for ant, formica, referring to its early isolation by the distillation of ant bodies, and the trivial name in some languages means \"ant-acid\", such as Dutch mierenzuur, Danish myresyre, Faroese meyrus\u00FDra, Fran\u00E7ais acide formique and German Ameisens\u00E4ure. Esters, salts, and the anions derived from formic acid are called formates.\nIn the 15th century, many alchemists reported that ants use an acidid fluid for defense. English naturalist John Ray was the first to get formic acid, by distilling ants, in 1671.\nIn nature, it is found in most ants. The wood ants from the genus Formica can spray formic acid on their preys or to defend the nest. It is also known from the trichomes of stinging nettle (\"Urtica dioica\"). Formic acid is a naturally occurring component of the atmosphere due primarily to forest emissions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carboxylic_acid","surface_form":"carboxylic acid","offset":50},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":78},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animals","offset":101},{"uri":"Defence","surface_form":"defence","offset":117},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":174},{"uri":"Alchemist","surface_form":"alchemist","offset":526},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":551},{"uri":"John_Ray","surface_form":"John Ray","offset":608},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distilling","offset":654},{"uri":"Formica","surface_form":"Formica","offset":746},{"uri":"Stinging_nettle","surface_form":"stinging nettle","offset":853}]}
