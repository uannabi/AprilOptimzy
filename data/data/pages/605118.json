It is about 15\u00A0km southwest of Eindhoven.\nHistory.\nWesterhoven is in a valley between the rivers 'Keersop' and 'Beekloop'. The rivers both flow just outside the middle of the village. There is evidence that prehistoric people lived in the area. The hill connecting to the nearby village Riethoven is from the Roman times. Frankish ceramics were found when some people removed an old oak shore. Westerhoven used to be part of the \u2018heerlijkheid\u2019 Bergeyk but became separated from it in 1810. Westerhoven became part of Bergeijk in 1997.\nKempenlands (an East Brabantian kind of language, which is similar to normal Dutch) is spoken in the area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":32},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":38},{"uri":"North_Brabant","surface_form":"North Brabant","offset":50},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":78},{"uri":"Bergeijk","surface_form":"Bergeijk","offset":94},{"uri":"Eindhoven","surface_form":"Eindhoven","offset":135},{"uri":"Pre-history","surface_form":"prehistoric","offset":311},{"uri":"Riethoven","surface_form":"Riethoven","offset":391},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":413},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Frankish","offset":426},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":435},{"uri":"East_Brabantian","surface_form":"East Brabantian","offset":655},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":716}]}
