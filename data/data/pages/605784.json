Additionally, he has received six Grammy Award nominations during his career.\nPersonal life.\nPost lives in Los Angeles, California. He also has a multimillion-dollar 13,000-square-foot home in northern Utah. Post's old home in San Fernando Valley, California was robbed on September 1, 2018. Post was in a three-year-long relationship with Ashlen Diaz, ending in November 2018.\nOn August 21, 2018, Post boarded a plane leaving Teterboro Airport and was scheduled to land in London Luton Airport. At 10:50 am, the tires blew out on takeoff and the plane was rerouted to Stewart International Airport for an emergency landing. The plane landed safely at 3:50 pm. Once the plane had landed, Post tweeted about the incident, writing \"i landed guys. thank you for your prayers. can't believe how many people wished death on me on this website. fuck you. but not today.\"\nPost was involved in a car crash on September 8, 2018. Post's white Rolls-Royce was driving through Santa Monica in the early morning when it collided with another car at 3:30 am. Although no one was severely injured in the incident, several people were treated for minor injuries.\nPolitical views.\nPost has a tattoo of U.S. president John F. Kennedy on his arm, and has said that Kennedy was \"the only President to speak out against the crazy corruption stuff that's going on in our government nowadays.\" In December 2016, Post stated that if asked to perform at the inauguration of Donald Trump he would not have been opposed, though he stated that neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton were fit for President of the United States and expressed his support of Bernie Sanders during the election cycle.\nPost later expressed a dislike for Trump in a November 2017 interview for \"Rolling Stone.\" In the same interview, he revealed that he has a large collection of guns and believes it is an American right to own and operate guns. Post also expressed a strong interest in conspiracy theories when he said, \"There's crazy shit that goes on that we can't explain.\" During a trip to Canada, Post was interviewed and when asked what the \"biggest lie is\", he replied \"The biggest lie in the world is the U.S. government. It's a fucking reality show and I think there's gonna be a lot of weird shit that happens within our generation that really changes the way of the world.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":191},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":196},{"uri":"Trap_music","surface_form":"trap","offset":205},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":215},{"uri":"Laconic","surface_form":"laconic","offset":260},{"uri":"Syracuse%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Syracuse, New York","offset":289},{"uri":"Grapevine%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Grapevine, Texas","offset":322},{"uri":"White_Iverson","surface_form":"White Iverson","offset":423},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"US \"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":473},{"uri":"Republic_Records","surface_form":"Republic Records","offset":546},{"uri":"Stoney_(album)","surface_form":"Stoney","offset":593},{"uri":"Congratulations_(Post_Malone_song)","surface_form":"Congratulations","offset":636},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":683},{"uri":"Beerbongs_%26amp%3B_Bentleys","surface_form":"Beerbongs & Bentleys","offset":719},{"uri":"Billboard_200","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" 200","offset":778},{"uri":"Streaming_media","surface_form":"streaming","offset":812},{"uri":"Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year","surface_form":"Album of the Year","offset":865},{"uri":"61st_Annual_Grammy_Awards","surface_form":"61st Annual Grammy Awards","offset":890},{"uri":"Swae_Lee","surface_form":"Swae Lee","offset":947},{"uri":"Sunflower_(Post_Malone_and_Swae_Lee_song)","surface_form":"Sunflower","offset":969},{"uri":"Into_the_Spider-Verse_(soundtrack)","surface_form":"the soundtrack","offset":984},{"uri":"Hollywood%27s_Bleeding","surface_form":"Hollywood's Bleeding","offset":1103},{"uri":"RIAA_certification","surface_form":"Diamond","offset":1243},{"uri":"Recording_Industry_Association_of_America","surface_form":"Recording Industry Association of America","offset":1272},{"uri":"American_Music_Awards","surface_form":"American Music Awards","offset":1384},{"uri":"Billboard_Music_Award","surface_form":"Billboard Music Award","offset":1409},{"uri":"MTV_Video_Music_Awards","surface_form":"MTV Video Music Award","offset":1437},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":1494},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1567},{"uri":"San_Fernando_Valley%2C_California","surface_form":"San Fernando Valley, California","offset":1687},{"uri":"Teterboro_Airport","surface_form":"Teterboro Airport","offset":1887},{"uri":"Luton_Airport","surface_form":"Luton Airport","offset":1941},{"uri":"Stewart_International_Airport","surface_form":"Stewart International Airport","offset":2029},{"uri":"Rolls-Royce","surface_form":"Rolls-Royce","offset":2393},{"uri":"Santa_Monica%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Monica","offset":2425},{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
