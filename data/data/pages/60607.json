{"id":60607,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbilling","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gerbilling is an urban legend. This means it a story that is not true. It is the act of placing a gerbil into the human rectum for sexual pleasure. Other small live animals (usually gerbils but also mice, hamsters, rats and various other rodents) are used.\nFolklorist Jan Harold Brunvand writes that the urban legend began in 1984. It involved a mouse and an unidentified gay man. In passing years this story changes into a gerbil, and was made to involve to many named male celebrities that were publicly thought to be gay. Rumors about various male celebrities engaging in gerbilling have become popular urban legends over the years.\nIn Poland, World War II historian Marek Jan Chodakiewicz lectured on gerbilling at the Institute of National Remembrance's educational center, describing that his ex-girlfriend Debbie, a registered nurse, extracted a fat-smeared hamster from the rectum of a gay man in 1984. Polish media stated that the hamster story is a well known urban legend, so well known that it has a Wikipedia page.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urban_legend","surface_form":"urban legend","offset":30},{"uri":"Gerbil","surface_form":"gerbil","offset":111},{"uri":"Rectum","surface_form":"rectum","offset":133},{"uri":"Gerbil","surface_form":"gerbil","offset":195},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":212},{"uri":"Hamster","surface_form":"hamster","offset":218},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":228},{"uri":"Rodents","surface_form":"rodents","offset":251},{"uri":"Folklore","surface_form":"Folklorist","offset":270},{"uri":"Jan_Harold_Brunvand","surface_form":"Jan Harold Brunvand","offset":281},{"uri":"Urban_legend","surface_form":"urban legend","offset":317},{"uri":"Celebrity","surface_form":"celebrities","offset":564},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":660},{"uri":"Marek_Jan_Chodakiewicz","surface_form":"Marek Jan Chodakiewicz","offset":683},{"uri":"Institute_of_National_Remembrance","surface_form":"Institute of National Remembrance","offset":736}]}
