{"id":60648,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Njord","text":"e=\"preserve\">Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r is the god of the seas and the wind in Norse mythology. A member of the Vanir, he is the father of the twin gods Freyr and Freyja by an unnamed sister of his. He is married to the j\u00F6tunness Ska\u00F0i, daughter of \u00DEjazi.\nMarriage With Ska\u00F0i.\nSkadi's father \u00DEjazi caught Loki, and forced him to lure out the goddess I\u00F0unn, keeper of the apples which grant the \u00C6sir their phenomenal youth and longevity. As the gods began to age, they sought out the one responsible for taking Idunn; discovering it was \u00DEjazi, they killed him and freed I\u00F0unn. Angered at the offense, Ska\u00F0i came to fight the gods, but they did not want to fight her. The \u00C6sir instead offered Ska\u00F0i compensation, allowing her to choose a husband among the gods, but only by looking at their feet. Ska\u00F0i wished to marry Baldr, the most handsome of the gods, but the feet she picked belonged to Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r, whose feet were shining and clean. (Odin later took \u00DEjazi's eyes and placed them as stars in the night sky). When Ska\u00F0i moved to her new husband's home near the sea, she missed her mountain home. Trapped in a loveless marriage, she only spends half her time with her husband. When Ska\u00F0i is away, Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r is sad, causing storms at the sea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":59},{"uri":"Vanir","surface_form":"Vanir","offset":92},{"uri":"Freyr","surface_form":"Freyr","offset":133},{"uri":"Freyja","surface_form":"Freyja","offset":143},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tunn","surface_form":"j\u00F6tunness","offset":200},{"uri":"Ska%C3%B0i","surface_form":"Ska\u00F0i","offset":210},{"uri":"%C3%9Ejazi","surface_form":"\u00DEjazi","offset":229},{"uri":"Loki","surface_form":"Loki","offset":285},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":322},{"uri":"Idun","surface_form":"I\u00F0unn","offset":330},{"uri":"Baldur","surface_form":"Baldr","offset":797},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":915},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":1060},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":1198}]}
