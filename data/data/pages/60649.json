{"id":60649,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyr","text":"e=\"preserve\">Freyr (Old Norse: \u201C[the] Lord\u201D) is the god of prosperity, fair weather, and fertility in Norse mythology, associated with sacral kingship, and virility. A member of the Vanir, he is the son of Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r and twin brother of Freyja. Husband of Ger\u00F0r, Freyr rides into battle on the massive shining boar Gullinbursti (Old Norse: \u201CGolden maned\u201D or \u201Cbristled\u201D) and possesses the mighty ship Sk\u00ED\u00F0bla\u00F0nir (Old Norse: \u201Cassembled from thin pieces of wood\u201D), both forged by the drawrven brothers collectively known as the Sons of Ivaldi. Sk\u00ED\u00F0bla\u00F0nir is said to always have a favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when not in use. Freyr once wielded the legendary sword S\u00FCmrbran\u00F0r (Old Norse: \u201CSword of summer\u201D), which was said to be able to fight by itself.\nWhen Freyr snuck in and sat on Odin's throne Hli\u00F0skj\u00E1lf (on which one can see anything, anywhere across the Nine Worlds), instead of seeing Freyja (who was recently lost somewhere), Freyr came across Ger\u00F0r, a beautiful giantess native to J\u00F6tunheimr. He fell in love, and sent his servant Sk\u00EDrnir to woo her for him, but Ger\u00F0r refused to marry the god until Skirnir threatened to kill Ger\u00F0r with Freyr's sword and damage her lands. Ger\u00F0r finally agreed to marry Freyr, who then gave his sword to Sk\u00EDrnir as a reward.\nFrey's realm is \u00C1lfheimr, the land of the elves. He is the patron god of Sweden. Statues of Odin, Thor, Frey, Frigg, and Freyja are often found in ancient temples.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":20},{"uri":"Prosperity","surface_form":"prosperity","offset":59},{"uri":"Fertility","surface_form":"fertility","offset":89},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":102},{"uri":"Vanir","surface_form":"Vanir","offset":182},{"uri":"Njord","surface_form":"Nj\u00F6r\u00F0r","offset":206},{"uri":"Freyja","surface_form":"Freyja","offset":233},{"uri":"Ger%C3%B0r","surface_form":"Ger\u00F0r","offset":252},{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":325},{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":409},{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":710},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":818},{"uri":"Gerd","surface_form":"Ger\u00F0r","offset":987},{"uri":"J%C3%B6tnar","surface_form":"giantess","offset":1006},{"uri":"Jotunheim","surface_form":"J\u00F6tunheimr","offset":1025},{"uri":"%C3%81lfheimr","surface_form":"\u00C1lfheimr","offset":1319},{"uri":"Elf","surface_form":"elves","offset":1345},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":1376},{"uri":"Odin","surface_form":"Odin","offset":1395},{"uri":"Thor","surface_form":"Thor","offset":1401},{"uri":"Frigg","surface_form":"Frigg","offset":1413},{"uri":"Freyja","surface_form":"Freyja","offset":1424},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":1458}]}
