{"id":606795,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Kah_Kee_MRT_station","text":"e=\"preserve\">Tan Kah Kee MRT Station is a MRT station in Singapore. It is the first station to be named after a person. It is named after Tan Kah Kee, a Chinese businessman, community leader and philanthropist. It is within walking distance of Hwa Chong Institution, Nanyang Girls' High School, Raffles Girls' Primary School, Methodist Girls' School, and National Junior College.\nPrior to the opening of the station, this station was named Duchess, and all of the Hwa Chong students wished to name the station \"Hwa Chong\". Other Singaporeans also decided to name it Hillcrest, Watten, Namly or Coronation. In the end, it was renamed to Tan Kah Kee, in honour of the businessman and community leader who founded Hwa Chong Institution.\nDuring the Downtown MRT Line Stage 2 open house on 5 December 2015, LTA was told that the Tamil translation of the station name was incorrect. The LTA apologized in the evening for the error.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":57},{"uri":"Philanthropist","surface_form":"philanthropist","offset":195},{"uri":"Tamil_language","surface_form":"Tamil","offset":824}]}
