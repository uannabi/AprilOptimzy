{"id":6068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch","text":"Starch is a complex carbohydrate. It is made of many glucose units joined by chemical bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as an energy store. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets. Pasta, potatoes, bread, and other starchy foods are made out of carbohydrates.\nStarch in food.\nSome good food sources of starch are cereals, bread, potatoes, grains, peas, and beans. Starch is also used for thickening sauces in cooking and thickening cold foods during a preheat. Starch is a white powder that is tasteless and odourless. You might know cornstarch or cornflour which is a popular kind of starch made from corn.\nFoods with a lot of starch produce more energy than other foods. However, if this energy is not used, it is turned into fat by our livers.\nLaundry starch.\nThere are also different kinds of starch, like laundry starch, which gives clothing a smooth and crisp feel. Sweat and dirt from a person\u2019s wrist and neck will stick to the starch on the clothes, not to the fibers of the clothes, and will wash away along with the starch. Then, after each laundry load, the starch can be used again.\nOther facts.\nStarch glues are used in wood, cotton, and bonding of paper. Animals and humans have amylase, so they can digest starch.\nStarch was used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the collars and ruffs of the fine linen which surrounded the neck. Starch also requires heat to thicken. The actual temperature depends on the type of starch.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carbohydrate","surface_form":"carbohydrate","offset":20},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"chemical bond","offset":77},{"uri":"Polysaccharide","surface_form":"polysaccharide","offset":98},{"uri":"Green_plant","surface_form":"green plant","offset":133},{"uri":"Diet","surface_form":"diet","offset":210},{"uri":"Pasta","surface_form":"Pasta","offset":217},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":224},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":234},{"uri":"Cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":349},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":375},{"uri":"Pea","surface_form":"pea","offset":383},{"uri":"Bean","surface_form":"bean","offset":393},{"uri":"Cook","surface_form":"cook","offset":445},{"uri":"White","surface_form":"white","offset":509},{"uri":"Taste","surface_form":"taste","offset":530},{"uri":"Odor","surface_form":"odourless","offset":544},{"uri":"Corn_starch","surface_form":"cornstarch","offset":570},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"corn","offset":638},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":764},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":775},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":1170},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":1176},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":1199},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"Animal","offset":1206},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":1218},{"uri":"Amylase","surface_form":"amylase","offset":1230},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1285},{"uri":"1500s","surface_form":"16th","offset":1299},{"uri":"1600s","surface_form":"17th","offset":1308}]}
