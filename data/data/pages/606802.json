{"id":606802,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallang_MRT_station","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kallang MRT Station (EW10) is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit station on the East West Line in Kallang, Singapore. It is painted in yellow livery and located next to the Kallang River, which is famous for its water sports. This is the last above-ground station westbound until Redhill. Westward of the station towards Lavender, the tracks lose elevation until they level out when sufficiently underground. This is because of space limitations in the Central Business District.\nThe station is within the vicinity of Boon Keng MRT Station on the North East Line, Stadium MRT Station on the Circle Line and Geylang Bahru MRT Station on the Downtown Line. Kallang station is located next to the Lorong 1 Geylang Bus Terminal and within walking distance to the Kallang Riverside Park located at Kampong Bugis.\nWhen Stadium MRT Station was under construction, Kallang station would be crowded when either the Singapore Indoor Stadium or the National Stadium hosted an event. After the opening of the Singapore Sports Hub, a sheltered walkway was built to connect Kallang station to the Singapore Sports Hub to ease overcrowding on Stadium station which only caters to 3-car trains.\nIt was formerly E3, before 2001.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Mass Rapid Transit","offset":59},{"uri":"East_West_MRT_Line","surface_form":"East West Line","offset":93},{"uri":"Kallang","surface_form":"Kallang","offset":111},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":120},{"uri":"Kallang_River","surface_form":"Kallang River","offset":186},{"uri":"Redhill_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Redhill","offset":293},{"uri":"Boon_Keng_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Boon Keng MRT Station","offset":531},{"uri":"North_East_MRT_Line","surface_form":"North East Line","offset":560},{"uri":"Stadium_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Stadium MRT Station","offset":577},{"uri":"Circle_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Circle Line","offset":604},{"uri":"Geylang_Bahru_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Geylang Bahru MRT Station","offset":620},{"uri":"Downtown_MRT_Line","surface_form":"Downtown Line","offset":653},{"uri":"Kallang_Riverside_Park","surface_form":"Kallang Riverside Park","offset":772},{"uri":"Stadium_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Stadium MRT Station","offset":826},{"uri":"Singapore_Indoor_Stadium","surface_form":"Singapore Indoor Stadium","offset":919},{"uri":"National_Stadium%2C_Singapore","surface_form":"National Stadium","offset":951}]}
