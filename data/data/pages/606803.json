{"id":606803,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redhill_MRT_station","text":"=\"preserve\">Redhill MRT Station (EW18) is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit station on the East West Line located in Bukit Merah, Singapore. This is the last above-ground station eastbound until Kallang station. Eastward of the station towards Tiong Bahru Estate, the tracks lose elevation until they level out when sufficiently underground. This is because of the space limitations as there is no such elevation of tracks in the Central Business District. This station is near to Enable Village for people with special needs.\nRedhill is the only MRT station in which the two platforms are not parallel to each other.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Mass Rapid Transit","offset":58},{"uri":"East_West_MRT_Line","surface_form":"East West Line","offset":92},{"uri":"Bukit_Merah","surface_form":"Bukit Merah","offset":118},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":131},{"uri":"Kallang_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Kallang","offset":196},{"uri":"Tiong_Bahru_Estate","surface_form":"Tiong Bahru Estate","offset":245},{"uri":"Enable_Village","surface_form":"Enable Village","offset":482}]}
