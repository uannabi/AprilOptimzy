Jacob Zuma, the President of South Africa, phoned Mugabe and confirmed that he was \"fine\", but under house arrest.\nThe coup took place amid troubles in the ruling ZANU\u2013PF party between former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was backed by the army, and First Lady Grace Mugabe, backed by the younger G40 section, over who would replace the elderly President Mugabe. Grace Mugabe warned to a coup in October 2017.\nA week after Mnangagwa was fired and forced to flee the country, and a day before troops moved into Harare, army chief Constantino Chiwenga issued a statement that purges of senior ZANU-PF officials like Mnangagwa had to stop. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned as president. Emmerson Mnangagwa became the President of Zimbabwe on November 24, 2017.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Harare","surface_form":"Harare","offset":79},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":102},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":266},{"uri":"Robert_Mugabe","surface_form":"Robert Mugabe","offset":297},{"uri":"Jacob_Zuma","surface_form":"Jacob Zuma","offset":485},{"uri":"President_of_South_Africa","surface_form":"President of South Africa","offset":501},{"uri":"House_arrest","surface_form":"house arrest","offset":586},{"uri":"ZANU%E2%80%93PF","surface_form":"ZANU\u2013PF","offset":648},{"uri":"Emmerson_Mnangagwa","surface_form":"Emmerson Mnangagwa","offset":692},{"uri":"First_Lady_of_Zimbabwe","surface_form":"First Lady","offset":744},{"uri":"Grace_Mugabe","surface_form":"Grace Mugabe","offset":755},{"uri":"Generation_40","surface_form":"G40","offset":791},{"uri":"Constantino_Chiwenga","surface_form":"Constantino Chiwenga","offset":1023},{"uri":"Emmerson_Mnangagwa","surface_form":"Emmerson Mnangagwa","offset":1183}]}
