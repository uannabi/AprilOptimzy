The others are\u00A0Sassi Punnun,\u00A0Mirza Sahiba, and\u00A0Heer Ranjha. Sohni Mahiwal is a tragic love story which reverts the classical motif of Hero and Leader. The heroine Sohni, unhappily married to a man she despises, swims every night across the river using an earthenware pot to keep afloat in the water, to where her beloved Mehar herds buffaloes. One night her sister-in-law replaces the earthenware pot with a vessel of unbaked clay, which dissolves in water and she dies in the whirling waves of the river.\nThe story also appears in\u00A0Shah Jo Risalo\u00A0and is one of seven popular tragic romances from\u00A0Sindh. The other six tales are\u00A0Umar Marui,\u00A0Sassui Punhun,\u00A0Lila Chanesar,\u00A0Noori Jam Tamachi,\u00A0Sorath Rai Diyach\u00A0and\u00A0Momal Rano\u00A0commonly known as\u00A0\"Seven Heroines\"\u00A0(Sindhi:\u00A0\u0633\u062A \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0645\u064A\u0648\u0646\u00A0\u200E) of\u00A0Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Shah begins the story at the most dramatic moment, when a young woman cries out for help in the cold river, attacked by crocodiles. The whole chapter (Sur Sohni) is merely an extension of this dreadful and yet hoped-for moment when the vessel of her body breaks and she, faithful to her pre-eternal love-covenant with Mehar, will be forever united through death.\nSohni is one of the favourite folktales both in\u00A0Sindh\u00A0and\u00A0Punjab.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
