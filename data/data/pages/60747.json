{"id":60747,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_salamander","text":"The giant salamanders are a family of large aquatic amphibia, the Cryptobranchidae'\".\nThey are the largest living amphibians. The Japanese giant salamander (\"Andrias japonicus\"), reaches up to, feeds on fish and crustaceans, and has been known to live for more than 50 years in captivity. The Chinese giant salamander (\"Andrias davidianus\") can reach a length of.\nThey live in brooks and ponds in the eastern United States (the hellbender), and in China and Japan.\nAnatomy.\nCryptobranchids are large, fat salamanders, with folds of skin along their flanks. These help increase the animal's surface area, allowing them to absorb more oxygen from the water.\nTheir metamorphosis from the larval stage is incomplete, so that the adults retain gill slits (although they also have lungs), and lack eyelids.\nChinese giant salamanders have lived as long as 75 years in captivity. It eats aquatic insects, fish, frogs and also crabs and shrimps.\nHunting habits.\nThey hunt mainly at night, and as they have poor eyesight, use sensory nodes on their head and body to detect tiny changes in water pressure, allowing them to find their prey.\nReproduction.\nDuring mating season, these salamanders will travel upstream. After the fertilization of the eggs, the male will guard them for at least six months. At this point, the offspring will live off their noticeable stored fat until they are ready to hunt. Once ready they will hunt as a group rather than individually.\nScientists at Asa Zoo in Japan have recently discovered that the male salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den. Sometimes the male \"den master\" will also allow a second male into the den, but the reason for this is unclear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salamander","surface_form":"salamander","offset":10},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":44},{"uri":"Amphibia","surface_form":"amphibia","offset":52},{"uri":"Japanese_giant_salamander","surface_form":"Japanese giant salamander","offset":130},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":203},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":212},{"uri":"Chinese_giant_salamander","surface_form":"Chinese giant salamander","offset":293},{"uri":"Brook","surface_form":"brook","offset":377},{"uri":"Pond","surface_form":"pond","offset":388},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":409},{"uri":"Hellbender","surface_form":"hellbender","offset":428},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":448},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":458},{"uri":"Salamander","surface_form":"salamander","offset":505},{"uri":"Metamorphosis","surface_form":"metamorphosis","offset":662},{"uri":"Hunt","surface_form":"hunt","offset":958},{"uri":"Night","surface_form":"night","offset":973},{"uri":"Vision","surface_form":"eyesight","offset":1002},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":1039},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":1048},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":1085},{"uri":"Fertilization","surface_form":"fertilization","offset":1215},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"Scientist","offset":1456},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":1521}]}
