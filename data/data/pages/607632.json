It is the highest mountain in the French Pyrenees, the Occitanie region and in the Hautes-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es department. The mountain is in the \"Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es National Park\" (France) and in the \"Reserva de la Biosfera Ordesa-Vi\u00F1amala\" (Spain).\nGeography.\nThe \"Pique-Longue\" can bee seen easily from other mountains and even from the city of Lourdes.\nThe Vignemale is also where is the second largest of the Pyrenean glaciers (after the one one in Aneto): the \"Ossoue\" glacier with an area of around. The easiest route to climb the mountain, and the one most used, is across this glacier.\nHistory.\nOn August 1792, some shepherds climbed the \"Pique-Longue\" following orders from Louis-Philippe Reinhart Junker who was in charge of a team that was studying the French-Spanish border. But the names of those shepherds are not known.\nThe first known ascent of this peak was made 45 years later, on 8 October 1837, by Henri Cazaux, from Luz (now Luz-Saint-Sauveur), and his brother-in-law Bernard Guillembet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":40},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenean","offset":47},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summit","offset":56},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":84},{"uri":"Pyrenees","surface_form":"Pyrenees","offset":123},{"uri":"Aneto","surface_form":"Aneto","offset":139},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":176},{"uri":"Province_of_Huesca","surface_form":"Huesca","offset":196},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":218},{"uri":"Hautes-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Hautes-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es","offset":232},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":267},{"uri":"Occitanie","surface_form":"Occitanie","offset":304},{"uri":"Regions_of_France","surface_form":"region","offset":314},{"uri":"Lourdes","surface_form":"Lourdes","offset":575},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":650},{"uri":"Shepherd","surface_form":"shepherd","offset":852},{"uri":"Peak","surface_form":"peak","offset":1094},{"uri":"Luz-Saint-Sauveur","surface_form":"Luz-Saint-Sauveur","offset":1174}]}
