As its name shows, it is made of characters that have in part been \"simplified\" from the original written form, which are called traditional Chinese characters.\nHistory.\nWhen the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, the Communist Party of China under Mao Zedong wanted to help the Chinese people read and write. Before 1949, most Chinese people could not read. The government hoped that by using fewer strokes to write characters, along with many other changes in the education system, the Chinese language would become more standardized like Japanese. The Empire of Japan had brought changes to the Japanese writing system during the earlier Meiji Restoration to make literacy and education more widely available to all Japanese citizens. Mao also hoped that simplifying Chinese characters would begin to shift Chinese people away from using the character system itself and that eventually Chinese-speakers would only use a phonetic alphabet to write.\nThe first set of simplified Chinese characters were first put to public use in 1956. Over time, more characters became \"simplified\", or existing ones changed, once in 1964 and again in 1978 and 1984. Many people did not like these changes because too many characters with different meanings were merged.\nIn hopes of promoting phonetic writing, the CCP was also working creating a standard romanization to accurately represent the pronunciation of Standard Chinese, pinyin. It was first taught in primary schools in 1958.\nRoughly 2,000 Chinese characters have been simplified.\nCurrent use.\nToday, simplified Chinese characters are used throughout Mainland China. It is also taught and used in some countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, and Malaysia.\nSince the Republic of China fled to Taiwan and became separated from the rest of China, the government there did not choose to simplify its writing system, and so it still uses the older traditional Chinese characters. The territories of Hong Kong and Macau have also kept using traditional characters, even though they are politically part of the rest of China, which switched to simplified characters.\nIt could not be proven that Simplified Chinese characters were able to help people with reading and writing. As places using Traditional Chinese characters did not have literacy problems, in 2009 Pan Qing-Lin, a Chinese official, suggested to stop using Simplified Chinese characters. This did not happen.\nIn multi-racial societies, like Singapore, students have been learning a second language for many years. Because of this, Simplified Chinese characters are welcomed by students. People who learned the simplified set had little problem changing over to the traditional set. Even to this day, there are many reasons for the need to use traditional Chinese characters, such as working in places that did not adapt the simplified Chinese characters or reading older books that have not yet been translated to Simplified Chinese characters.\nMost simplified characters have far fewer strokes. For example, the traditional character \u99AC has 10 strokes, while its simplified version \u9A6C only has 3 strokes. However, there are some simplified characters with more strokes than their simplified versions. For example, the traditional character \u5F37 has 11 strokes, while the simplified version \u5F3A has 12 strokes.\nSimplified vs. traditional characters.\nBelow is a list of simplified characters next to their traditional versions.\nThere are several ways to simplify characters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chinese_characters","surface_form":"Chinese characters","offset":85},{"uri":"Traditional_Chinese_characters","surface_form":"traditional Chinese characters","offset":234},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":284},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party of China","offset":335},{"uri":"Mao_Zedong","surface_form":"Mao Zedong","offset":366},{"uri":"Chinese_people","surface_form":"Chinese people","offset":445},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":480},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":583},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":658},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Empire of Japan","offset":672},{"uri":"Meiji_Restoration","surface_form":"Meiji Restoration","offset":758},{"uri":"Literacy","surface_form":"literacy","offset":784},{"uri":"Japanese_people","surface_form":"Japanese citizens","offset":836},{"uri":"Phonetics","surface_form":"phonetic","offset":1040},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"CCP","offset":1416},{"uri":"Romanization","surface_form":"romanization","offset":1457},{"uri":"Standard_Chinese_language","surface_form":"Standard Chinese","offset":1515},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"pinyin","offset":1533},{"uri":"Mainland_China","surface_form":"Mainland China","offset":1714},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":1778},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":1804},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":1819},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":1839},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":1865},{"uri":"Traditional_Chinese_characters","surface_form":"traditional Chinese characters","offset":2016},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":2067},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":2081},{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":2153},{"uri":"Second_language","surface_form":"second language","offset":2612},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translated","offset":3030}]}
