Panda sees Skunk as crucial to saving the valley and endeavors to teach Skunk who often tries to circumvent laborious Kung Fu training, only to learn the value of the initial lesson from the consequences of his actions with Skunk ultimately saving the day, usually by himself or with the help of his friends.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":148},{"uri":"Cartoon_Network","surface_form":"Cartoon Network","offset":165},{"uri":"Cartoon_Saloon","surface_form":"Cartoon Saloon","offset":294},{"uri":"Telegael","surface_form":"Telegael","offset":310},{"uri":"Cartoon_Network_Studios","surface_form":"Cartoon Network Studios","offset":323}]}
