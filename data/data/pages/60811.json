{"id":60811,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere","text":"The asthenosphere is part of earth's mantle. It is about 100\u00A0km to 350\u00A0km under the surface. It is the lower part of the upper mantle, and behaves as a hot viscous liquid.\nIt consists of hot, weak material that can be deformed like silly putty. That means it is capable of gradual flow. It is under the lithosphere.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"earth","offset":29},{"uri":"Mantle_(geology)","surface_form":"mantle","offset":37},{"uri":"Viscosity","surface_form":"viscous","offset":156},{"uri":"Silly_Putty","surface_form":"silly putty","offset":232},{"uri":"Flux","surface_form":"flow","offset":281},{"uri":"Lithosphere","surface_form":"lithosphere","offset":303}]}
