A section of the line can be cut exactly in half with a single point.\nTwo dimensions.\nTwo dimensions is a flat sheet. Two shapes on this sheet can be cut exactly in half with a single line.\nThree dimensions.\nThree dimensions is space. Three objects in space can be cut exactly in half with a single flat sheet.\nFour dimensions.\nFour dimensions is a hyperspace. Four hyper-objects can be cut exactly in half with a single space.\nName.\nThe theorem is called the ham sandwich theorem because sandwiches are made of three dimensional pieces of bread that are cut in half with a flat sheet, like a slice of ham. If there were three pieces of bread, it would be possible to make one cut along a plane to divide each of bread into two equal pieces. If a piece of ham is then put between each sliced piece of bread, the result would be three ham sandwiches.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theorem","surface_form":"theorem","offset":48},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":774}]}
