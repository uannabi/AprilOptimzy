{"id":608233,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprefectures_in_France","text":"In France, a subprefecture () is the administrative center of a departmental arrondissement that does not contain the prefecture for its department. The term also applies to the building that houses the administrative headquarters for an arrondissement.\nThe civil servant in charge of a subprefecture is the subprefect, assisted by a general secretary. Between May 1982 and February 1988, subprefects were known instead by the title \"commissaire adjoint de la R\u00E9publique\".\nWhere the administration of an arrondissement is carried out from a prefecture, the general secretary to the prefect carries out duties equivalent to those of the subprefect.\nThe municipal arrondissements of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille are divisions of the city (or commune) rather than the prefecture, and so are not arrondissements in the same sense.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arrondissements_in_France","surface_form":"departmental arrondissement","offset":64},{"uri":"Prefectures_in_France","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":118},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":137},{"uri":"Civil_servant","surface_form":"civil servant","offset":258},{"uri":"General_secretary","surface_form":"general secretary","offset":334},{"uri":"Municipal_arrondissement_in_France","surface_form":"municipal arrondissements","offset":652},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":681},{"uri":"Lyon","surface_form":"Lyon","offset":688},{"uri":"Marseille","surface_form":"Marseille","offset":698},{"uri":"Commune_in_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":738}]}
