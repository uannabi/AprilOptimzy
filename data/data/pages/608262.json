{"id":608262,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_exchange_chromatography","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ion exchange chromatography (or\u00A0ion chromatography) is a\u00A0process in chromatography\u00A0that separates\u00A0ions\u00A0and\u00A0polar molecules based on their attraction to the\u00A0ion\u00A0exchanger. It works on almost any kind of\u00A0charged molecule\u2014including large\u00A0proteins, small\u00A0nucleotides, and\u00A0amino acids. The two types of ion chromatography are: \"anion-exchange\" and \"cation-exchange\" chromatography. They are used in protein purification, water analysis,\u00A0and quality control.\nThe water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to\u00A0moieties\u00A0which are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase.The equilibrated stationary phase is made of an ionizable functional groups where targeted molecules of mixtures are separated and quantified while passing through the column. A cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations. Cation exchange chromatography is used when the desired molecules to separate are cations and anion exchange chromatography is used to separate anions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chromatography","surface_form":"chromatography","offset":81},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":111},{"uri":"Proteins","surface_form":"proteins","offset":248},{"uri":"Nucleotides","surface_form":"nucleotides","offset":264},{"uri":"Amino_acids","surface_form":"amino acids","offset":281},{"uri":"Anion","surface_form":"anion","offset":336},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":407},{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acids","offset":524},{"uri":"Peptide","surface_form":"peptides","offset":541},{"uri":"Ionic_bond","surface_form":"ionic bonds","offset":607},{"uri":"Equilibrium_constant","surface_form":"equilibrated","offset":657}]}
