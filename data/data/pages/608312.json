{"id":608312,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontotemporal_dementia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the clinical presentation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. It is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes, and typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons, while other neuron types remain intact.\nSecond only to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prevalence, FTD accounts for 20% of young-onset dementia cases.\nCommon signs and symptoms include significant changes in social and personal behavior, apathy, blunting of emotions, and deficits in both expressive and receptive language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frontotemporal_lobar_degeneration","surface_form":"frontotemporal lobar degeneration","offset":75},{"uri":"Neuron","surface_form":"neuron","offset":145},{"uri":"Frontal_lobe","surface_form":"frontal","offset":187},{"uri":"Temporal_lobe","surface_form":"temporal lobe","offset":198},{"uri":"Spindle_neuron","surface_form":"spindle neuron","offset":246},{"uri":"Alzheimer%27s_disease","surface_form":"Alzheimer's disease","offset":318}]}
