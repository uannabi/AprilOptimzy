{"id":60837,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Atlantic_hurricane_season","text":"The 1986 Atlantic hurricane season officially started on June 1, 1983, and ended on November 30. The season had a total of 6 named storms and 4 hurricanes.\nTropical Storm Andrew.\nTropical Depression One formed on June 5 north of the Bahamas. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Andrew the next day. Andrew traveled along the East Coast of the United States, creating giant waves and high surf along the shore but with minor damages. Andrew dissipated south of Cape Cod. One person drowned off the North Carolina coast in high surf, but no major damages was reported.\nHurricane Bonnie.\nTropical Depression Two formed south of the Louisiana coast on June 23 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane. Bonnie made landfall on the upper Texas coast near High Island. Streets were flooded throughout southeast Texas, mobile homes were destroyed, and three people were killed. Bonnie caused $2 million (1986 USD) in damage.\nHurricane Charley.\nA tropical depression formed off the coast of the Florida and moved inland. The depression then travelled across Florida and exited the coast near Savannah, Georgia, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Charley. Charley continued moving up the coastline, and the storm strengthened into a hurricane before moving across the Outer Banks and Delmarva Peninsula. Charley then moved out into the sea, later became extratropical in the north Atlantic Ocean, and later brought bad weather across the British Isles on August 25 where it caused major damages.\nTropical Storm Danielle.\nOn September 1, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and moved west. The disturbance was below the 10 degree latitude as it developed into a tropical depression on September 7 and then strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. Danielle peaked as a 60\u00A0mph storm on September 8, while a Reconnaissance Aircraft reported gusts of up to hurricane force. After passing through the Lesser Antilles, Danielle came across vertical wind shear, and on September 10, it dissipated in the central Caribbean Sea. The remnants of Danielle continued to move west and eventually redeveloped in the Pacific Ocean as Tropical Storm Lester.\nHurricane Earl.\nThe strongest storm of the season began as a tropical wave off Africa on September 4. After moving across the tropical Atlantic Ocean it strengthened as Tropical Depression Five on September 10 while about 1240 miles (2000 km) east of Puerto Rico. The depression quickly strengthened and reached hurricane strength on September 11; Earl reached its strongest point on September 12, as a Category 2 hurricane as it travelled in a half circle.\nThe hurricane weakened to a Category 1 on September 16 and bounced back the way it came. Earl then turned north and became extratropical southeast of Newfoundland on September 19. At its strongest point, Earl had sustained winds of 105\u00A0mph (170\u00A0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 979 mbar.\nHurricane Frances.\nTropical Depression Six formed on November 18 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm curved northeast and strengthened further, reaching hurricane strength on November 20. However, a high pressure system to the north caused the storm to fall apart. Frances was later destroyed by an extratropical low on November 21.\nStorm names.\nThese were the names set aside to be used in 1986 Atlantic hurricane. In the Atlantic, the names are used again every six years, so many of these names were used in 1980 and again in 1992. The names that did not get used are marked with.\nRetirement.\nNo names were retired from the 1986 Atlantic hurricane season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":233},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":343},{"uri":"Cape_Cod","surface_form":"Cape Cod","offset":460},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":497},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":629},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":733},{"uri":"High_Island%2C_Texas","surface_form":"High Island","offset":750},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":805},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":987},{"uri":"Savannah%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Savannah","offset":1084},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":1094},{"uri":"Outer_Banks","surface_form":"Outer Banks","offset":1261},{"uri":"Delmarva_Peninsula","surface_form":"Delmarva Peninsula","offset":1277},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":1347},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":1374},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":1431},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical wave","offset":1532},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1569},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":1908},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":2017},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":2114},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical wave","offset":2215},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":2233},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":2289},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":2381},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"km","offset":2393},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":2405},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Category 2","offset":2557},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Category 1","offset":2640},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":2735},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":2762},{"uri":"Tropical_storm","surface_form":"tropical storm","offset":3004},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical low","offset":3228},{"uri":"1980_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1980","offset":3440},{"uri":"1992_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1992","offset":3458}]}
