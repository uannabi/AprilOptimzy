He was born in Bolln\u00E4s, Sweden. He was chairman of the Communist Party of Sweden (during his leadership renamed to \"the Left Party \u2013 Communists\") from 1964 to 1975 and member of parliament from 1963 to 1985. He was a major force in redirecting the Left Party Communists policies away from Moscow loyalism towards Eurocommunism and Scandinavian Popular Socialism.\nAt the time of Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, Hermansson heaped praise on Stalin's greatness in a few speeches, something he was regularly reminded of by journalists and political opponents, even though he repeatedly made public his regret for the things said.\nHermansson died on 26 July 2016 at the age of 98.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":71},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":79},{"uri":"Bolln%C3%A4s","surface_form":"Bolln\u00E4s","offset":106},{"uri":"Left_Party_(Sweden)","surface_form":"Communist Party of Sweden","offset":146},{"uri":"Eurocommunism","surface_form":"Eurocommunism","offset":404},{"uri":"Popular_Socialism","surface_form":"Scandinavian Popular Socialism","offset":422},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":469}]}
