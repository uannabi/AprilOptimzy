{"id":608557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Hinduism","text":"=\"preserve\">Hindus believe in one main God, Brahman. Most Hindus believe he is present in every person as the eternal spirit or soul, called the atman.\nFor Hindus there is a sacred symbol that represents their belief. Om (or Aum) is the sound to represent their God.\nThere is a Trimurti in the Hindu belief: Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer.\nHindus also believe that sometimes God may appear on earth in living form.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aum","surface_form":"Om","offset":218},{"uri":"Trimurti","surface_form":"Trimurti","offset":278},{"uri":"Brahma","surface_form":"Brahma","offset":308},{"uri":"Vishnu","surface_form":"Vishnu","offset":328},{"uri":"Shiva","surface_form":"Shiva","offset":353}]}
