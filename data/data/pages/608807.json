{"id":608807,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem","text":"e=\"preserve\">The intermediate value theorem says that if a function, formula_1, is continuous over a closed interval formula_1, and is equal to formula_1 and formula_1 at either end of the interval, for any number, c, between formula_1 and formula_1, we can find an formula_1 so that formula_1.\nThis means that if a continuous function's sign changes in an interval, we can find a root of the function in that interval. For example, if formula_1 and formula_1, we can find an formula_1 in the interval formula_1 that is a root of this function, meaning that for this value of x, formula_1, if formula_1 is continuous. This corollary is called Bolzano's theorem.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Continuous_function","surface_form":"continuous","offset":83},{"uri":"Interval_(mathematics)","surface_form":"closed interval","offset":101},{"uri":"Root_of_a_function","surface_form":"root","offset":381},{"uri":"Corollary","surface_form":"corollary","offset":623}]}
