{"id":608869,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hamel","text":"e=\"preserve\">Jacques Hamel (30 November 1930 \u2013 26 July 2016) was a French Catholic priest. He was born in Darn\u00E9tal, Seine-Maritime, France. He worked in the parish of Saint-\u00C9tienne-du-Rouvray.\nOn 26 July 2016, Hamel was murdered during the 2016 Normandy church attack by two Muslim men pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant while he celebrated Mass in his church. His throat was slit during the attack in Saint-\u00C9tienne-du-Rouvray, France. He was 85 years old.\nHamel was called a martyr by some international press shortly after his death. Calls to make him a saint started soon after his death. The canonization cause was officially opened at diocesan level in April 2017, after Pope Francis had waived the otherwise mandatory five-year waiting period for the opening of such causes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_Catholic","surface_form":"French Catholic","offset":67},{"uri":"Darn%C3%A9tal","surface_form":"Darn\u00E9tal","offset":106},{"uri":"Seine-Maritime","surface_form":"Seine-Maritime","offset":116},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":132},{"uri":"Saint-%C3%89tienne-du-Rouvray","surface_form":"Saint-\u00C9tienne-du-Rouvray","offset":167},{"uri":"2016_Normandy_church_attack","surface_form":"2016 Normandy church attack","offset":240},{"uri":"Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","surface_form":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","offset":313},{"uri":"Saint-%C3%89tienne-du-Rouvray","surface_form":"Saint-\u00C9tienne-du-Rouvray","offset":431},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":505},{"uri":"Canonization","surface_form":"make him a saint","offset":574}]}
