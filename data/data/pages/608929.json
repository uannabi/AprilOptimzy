The others are Bishan, Expo and Changi Airport stations.\nDue to space constraints, the two platforms at the station are seperated from each other and have their own faregates. A ten minute grace period was put in place by the Land Transport Authority in case passengers tap in at the wrong faregates.\nThe Stevens station is located at the junction of Bukit Timah road and Stevens road, where the station takes its name from.\nHistory.\nThis station opened on 27 December 2015, along with the rest of the Downtown line stage 2. The Thomson East Coast line section will open in 2021, as part of stage 3 of the line.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit system","offset":77},{"uri":"Bishan_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Bishan","offset":213},{"uri":"Expo_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Expo","offset":221},{"uri":"Changi_Airport_MRT_Station","surface_form":"Changi Airport","offset":230},{"uri":"Land_Transport_Authority","surface_form":"Land Transport Authority","offset":424}]}
