{"id":608961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenno","text":"Lenno is a small village on the shores of Lake Como in northern Italy. It is located about north of Milan and about northeast of Como. Lenno is on a small bay of Lake Como called the \"Golfo di Venere\" (Bay of Venus).\nAncient Romans started the village. Julius Ceasar invited 500 Greeks to come live in the village. The Greeks planted olive trees all around Lenno. The historian Paolo Giovio (1483-1552) and the geographer Abraham Ortelius (1527\u20131598) wrote that Pliny the Younger had a villa in Lenno. It was called the Comedy villa.\nToday, the village is popular with tourists. It has mansions, hotels, restaurants, and a small harbor. In 2014, Lenno was joined with three other nearby villages (Mezzegra, Ossuccio and Tremezzo) to make a single municipality called Comune di Tremezzina.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lake_Como","surface_form":"Lake Como","offset":42},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":100},{"uri":"Como","surface_form":"Como","offset":129},{"uri":"Venus_(mythology)","surface_form":"Venus","offset":209},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Romans","offset":217},{"uri":"Julius_Ceasar","surface_form":"Julius Ceasar","offset":253},{"uri":"Greeks","surface_form":"Greeks","offset":279},{"uri":"Olive_tree","surface_form":"olive tree","offset":334},{"uri":"Abraham_Ortelius","surface_form":"Abraham Ortelius","offset":422},{"uri":"Pliny_the_Younger","surface_form":"Pliny the Younger","offset":462},{"uri":"Roman_villa","surface_form":"villa","offset":486},{"uri":"Pliny%27s_Comedy_and_Tragedy_villas","surface_form":"the Comedy villa","offset":516},{"uri":"Mansion","surface_form":"mansion","offset":586},{"uri":"Harbor","surface_form":"harbor","offset":629},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":747}]}
