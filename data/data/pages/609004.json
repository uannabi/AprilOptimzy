{"id":609004,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogdoad_(Egyptian)","text":"In Egyptian mythology, the Ogdoad are a group of eight deities (divine beings) worshipped in Hermopolis. The gods of the Ogdoad were mostly seen as humans with the heads of animals, or just depicted as snakes and frogs. They were arranged in four male-female pairs, with the males associated with frogs, and the females with snakes. Their story is part of the Egyptian creation myth.\nThe Egyptians believed that before the world was formed, there was a watery mass of dark, directionless chaos. In this chaos lived the Ogdoad of Khmunu (Hermopolis). These were four frog gods and four snake goddesses of chaos. Together they represented balance in infinity.\nTheir names were Nun and Naunet (water), Amun and Amaunet (invisibility), Heh and Hauhet (infinity) and Kek and Kauket (darkness).\nThe chaos existed without the light, and thus Kek and Kauket came to represent this darkness. They also symbolized obscurity, the kind of obscurity that went with darkness, and night.\nThe Ogdoad were the original great gods of Iunu (On, Heliopolis) where they were thought to have helped with creation, then died and retired to the land of the dead where they continued to make the Nile River flow and the sun rise every day.\nBecause of this aspect of the eight, Budge believe that Kek and Kauket were once deities linked to Khnum and Satet, to Hapi - Nile gods of Abu (Elephantine). He also believed that Kek may have also been linked to Sobek.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"Egyptian mythology","offset":3},{"uri":"Hermopolis","surface_form":"Hermopolis","offset":93},{"uri":"Creation_myth","surface_form":"creation myth","offset":369},{"uri":"Nile_River","surface_form":"Nile River","offset":1171}]}
