The team's home arena is PNC Arena, in Raleigh, North Carolina. They won the Stanley Cup during the 2005-2006 season by beating the Edmonton Oilers. They play in Raleigh, North Carolina, but they moved in 1999 from Hartford, Connecticut, where they were known as the Hartford Whalers. They play in the Metropolitan Division of the NHL.\nThe name \"Hurricanes\" was chosen because the eastern part of North Carolina is often hit by hurricanes during tropical storm season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":31},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"NHL","offset":65},{"uri":"PNC_Arena","surface_form":"PNC Arena","offset":95},{"uri":"Raleigh%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Raleigh, North Carolina","offset":109},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":147},{"uri":"NHL_season_2005-2006","surface_form":"2005-2006","offset":170},{"uri":"Edmonton_Oilers","surface_form":"Edmonton Oilers","offset":202},{"uri":"Raleigh%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Raleigh, North Carolina","offset":232},{"uri":"Hartford%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Hartford, Connecticut","offset":285},{"uri":"Hartford_Whalers","surface_form":"Hartford Whalers","offset":337},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Division","surface_form":"Metropolitan Division","offset":372},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":498}]}
