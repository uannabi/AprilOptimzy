It was established by President Barack Obama in 2011.\nWhat do they do?\nIt is responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. They work within banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors and other financial companies operating in the United States.\nCreation.\nThe CFPB's creation was made by the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 and the eventual Great Recession. The CFPB was established as an independent agency, but this status is being reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals.\nLeadership.\nThe CFPB is headed by a chief who is appointed by the President for a five-year term. The bureau is also assisted by a Consumer Advisory Council, which is composed of at least six members who are recommended by regional Federal Reserve presidents.\nThe first director of the CFPB was Ohio politician Richard Cordray who served from 2012 through 2017. The current Director is Kathleen Kraninger since December 11, 2018.\n2020 Supreme Court decision.\nThe Supreme Court of the United State (SCOTUS), in a 5-to-4 decision, ruled June 29, 2020, that the structure of the CFPB violates the separation-of-powers clause of the constitution since the bill directed that the CFPB director could be removed by the president only for \"cause,\" defined as \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":68},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":126},{"uri":"Consumer_protection","surface_form":"consumer protection","offset":187},{"uri":"Financial_industry","surface_form":"financial sector","offset":214},{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"bank","offset":249},{"uri":"Credit_union","surface_form":"credit union","offset":256},{"uri":"Foreclosure","surface_form":"foreclosure","offset":336},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":428},{"uri":"Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308","surface_form":"financial crisis of 2007\u201308","offset":604},{"uri":"Great_Recession","surface_form":"Great Recession","offset":649},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":1076},{"uri":"Richard_Cordray","surface_form":"Richard Cordray","offset":1092},{"uri":"Kathleen_Kraninger","surface_form":"Kathleen Kraninger","offset":1167}]}
