{"id":609719,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbynmania","text":"Corbynmania is enthusiastic support for Jeremy Corbyn who was elected as leader of the Labour Party in 2015.\nHis authentic, informal style and radical policies appealed to many of the young new members who had joined after the membership fee had been reduced to \u00A33. Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the hustings across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed \"Corbynmania\" by the press.\nA chant of \"Oh, Jeremy Corbyn\" has now been adopted as an anthem or chorus by his supporters. This is sung in the style of \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes. It attracted especial attention at the Glastonbury festival of 2017, where Corbyn appeared and spoke to the crowds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jeremy_Corbyn","surface_form":"Jeremy Corbyn","offset":40},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"leader of the Labour Party","offset":73},{"uri":"Authentic_leadership","surface_form":"authentic","offset":113},{"uri":"Husting","surface_form":"husting","offset":325},{"uri":"Chant","surface_form":"chant","offset":446},{"uri":"Seven_Nation_Army","surface_form":"Seven Nation Army","offset":568},{"uri":"The_White_Stripes","surface_form":"The White Stripes","offset":590},{"uri":"Glastonbury_festival","surface_form":"Glastonbury festival","offset":648}]}
