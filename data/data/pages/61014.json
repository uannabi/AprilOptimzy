{"id":61014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_tube","text":"A boiling tube is a large tube made of glass, which is used in laboratory to strongly heat substances. A boiling tube is a scaled-up test tube, but larger in size. This larger size allows substances to boil freely inside a boiling tube.\nBoiling tubes can also be used as a replacement for test tubes specially when a larger volume is desired.\nBoiling tubes are commonly made from Pyrex glass which can tolerate high temperatures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Test_tube","surface_form":"test tube","offset":133},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":324},{"uri":"Pyrex","surface_form":"Pyrex","offset":380},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":416}]}
