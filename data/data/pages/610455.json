In the manosphere, some people described the Me Too movement as misandric.\nSince then, millions of people have used the hashtag to come forward with their experiences, including many celebrities.\nImpact.\nSome men, such as actors Terry Crews and James Van Der Beek, have responded to the hashtag with their own experiences of harassment and abuse.\nOn November 16, 2017, US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York specifically referred to \"the 'Me Too' Movement\" when asked about allegations of sexual misconduct by politicians such as President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, and Roy Moore.\nThe hashtag has been used in at least 85 countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hashtag","surface_form":"hashtag","offset":87},{"uri":"Sexual_assault","surface_form":"sexual assault","offset":142},{"uri":"Sexual_harassment","surface_form":"harassment","offset":161},{"uri":"Harvey_Weinstein","surface_form":"Harvey Weinstein","offset":255},{"uri":"Tarana_Burke","surface_form":"Tarana Burke","offset":328},{"uri":"Alyssa_Milano","surface_form":"Alyssa Milano","offset":369},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"tweet","offset":408},{"uri":"Misogyny","surface_form":"misogynistic","offset":480},{"uri":"Misandric","surface_form":"misandric","offset":567},{"uri":"Terry_Crews","surface_form":"Terry Crews","offset":732},{"uri":"James_Van_Der_Beek","surface_form":"James Van Der Beek","offset":748},{"uri":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","surface_form":"Kirsten Gillibrand","offset":883},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":1046},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":1077},{"uri":"Al_Franken","surface_form":"Al Franken","offset":1099},{"uri":"Roy_Moore","surface_form":"Roy Moore","offset":1128}]}
