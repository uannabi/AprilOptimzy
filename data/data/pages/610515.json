{"id":610515,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakaleo_schouteni","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Wakaleo schouteni\" is an extinct marsupial that once lived in Australia. It is closely related to the marsupial lion, \"Thylacoleo carnifex\", which lived until 30,000 years ago. \"Wakaleo schouteni\" is estimated to have become extinct about 19 million years ago.. It was the size of a small dog, and would have weighed about 23 kg. Scientists have estimated it is one of the oldest known members of the marsupial lion family.\nThe small marsupial lion has been named after wildlife artist, Peter Schouten. He has worked with paleontologists from the University of New South Wales, studying the fossils at the Riversleigh site in Queensland. They found the fossilized skull, teeth and humerus bone of the marsupial lion. At the time it lived the area would have been rainforest and it would have eaten small birds, possums and lizards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":39},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":47},{"uri":"Marsupial_lion","surface_form":"marsupial lion","offset":116},{"uri":"Paleontology","surface_form":"paleontologists","offset":536},{"uri":"University_of_New_South_Wales","surface_form":"University of New South Wales","offset":561},{"uri":"Australian_Fossil_Mammal_Sites_(Riversleigh)","surface_form":"Riversleigh","offset":620},{"uri":"Humerus","surface_form":"humerus","offset":695},{"uri":"Possum","surface_form":"possums","offset":825},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizards","offset":837}]}
