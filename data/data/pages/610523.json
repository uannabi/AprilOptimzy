{"id":610523,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusvara","text":"e=\"preserve\">Anusvara (Sanskrit: ')is the diacritic used to mark a type of nasal sound used in a number of Indic scripts.\nDepending on the location of the anusvara in the word and the language in which it is used, its exact pronunciation can vary greatly.\nIn the context of Sanskrit, anusvara may also refer also to the nasal sound itself.\n\u0985\u09A8\u09C1\u09B8\u09CD\u09AC\u09BE\u09B0 onushshar in Bengali is written as a circle above a slanted line (\u0982), and represents /\u014B/. It is used in the name of the Bengali language \u09AC\u09BE\u0982\u09B2\u09BE [ba\u014Bla]. It has merged in pronunciation with the letter \u0999 ung\u00F4 in Bengali. Although the onushshar is a consonant in Bengali phonology, it is nevertheless treated in the written system as a diacritic in that it is always directly adjacent to the preceding consonant, even when consonants are spaced, apart in titles or banners: \u09AC\u09BE\u0982-\u09B2\u09BE-\u09A6\u09C7-\u09B6 bang-la-de-sh, not \u09AC\u09BE-\u0982-\u09B2\u09BE-\u09A6\u09C7-\u09B6 ba-ng-la-de-sh for \u09AC\u09BE\u0982\u09B2\u09BE\u09A6\u09C7\u09B6 Bangladesh It is never pronounced with the inherent vowel \"\u00F4\", and it cannot take a vowel sign (instead, the consonant \u0999 ung\u00F4 is used pre-vocalically).\nDevanagari script, anusvara is represented with a dot (bindu) above the letter (e.g. \u092E\u0902).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":23},{"uri":"Diacritic","surface_form":"diacritic","offset":42},{"uri":"Bengali_Language","surface_form":"Bengali","offset":362},{"uri":"Phonology","surface_form":"phonology","offset":616}]}
