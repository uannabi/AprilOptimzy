{"id":610540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza","text":"Mirza (or;) is a name of Persian origin. It is used as a surname or prefix to identify patriarchal lineage.\nIt is derived from a historical Title role of Persian origin (M\u012Brz\u0101), denoting the rank of a royal prince, high nobleman, or a military commander equivalent to a nobleman. It is usually defined in English as Prince of the blood.\nSpecifically, it was used as a title by and today signifies patriarchal lineage to the various Persian Empire, Turkish Ottoman Empire, the Shirvanshahs and Circassians of the Caucasus, Mughals / Moguls or Muslim Rajputs of the Indian Subcontinent.[2] It was also a title bestowed upon members of the highest aristocracies in Tatar states, such as the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan.\nEtymology.\nThe word M\u012Brz\u0101 is derived from the Persian term \u2018Am\u012Brz\u0101de which literally means \"child of the \u2018Am\u012Br\" or \"child of the ruler\".[3] \u2018Am\u012Brz\u0101d in turn consists of the Arabic title \u2018Am\u012Br (english: Emir), meaning \"commander\" and \"Prince\", and the Persian suffix -z\u0101d, meaning \"birth\" or \"lineage\". Due to vowel harmony in Turkic languages, the alternative pronunciation Mortar (weapon) (plural morzalar; derived from the Persian word) is also used. The word Mirza means royalty in almost every old version of Persian, Arab, Caucasian, Turkish and Indian languages.\nVariant spellings in English include mirzya, miriza, mirize, mirze, morsey, mursay, murse, meirsa, mirzey, mursi, murze, murza, mirza, myrza, meerza.\nRoyal title.\nThe titles themselves were given by the King, Sultan and Emperor (equivalent to the western Fount of honour) to their sons and grandsons, or even distant kins. Noblemen loyal to the kings also received this Title.\nThe title itself is derived from the title Emir. Emir, meaning \"commander\" or \"Prince\", is derived from the Semitic root \"Amr\", meaning \"command\". Originally it simply meant \"commander\" or \"leader\", usually in reference to a group of people. It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word \"Prince.\" The word entered English in 1595, from the French \u00E9mir","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":25},{"uri":"Surname","surface_form":"surname","offset":57},{"uri":"Title_role","surface_form":"Title role","offset":140},{"uri":"Royal","surface_form":"royal","offset":201},{"uri":"Prince","surface_form":"prince","offset":207},{"uri":"Nobleman","surface_form":"nobleman","offset":220},{"uri":"Prince_of_the_blood","surface_form":"Prince of the blood","offset":316},{"uri":"Persian_Empire","surface_form":"Persian Empire","offset":432},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":456},{"uri":"Shirvanshahs","surface_form":"Shirvanshahs","offset":476},{"uri":"Tatar","surface_form":"Tatar","offset":662},{"uri":"Kazan","surface_form":"Kazan","offset":700},{"uri":"Astrakhan","surface_form":"Astrakhan","offset":710},{"uri":"Arabic","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":894},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Turkic languages","offset":1047},{"uri":"Mortar_(weapon)","surface_form":"Mortar (weapon)","offset":1095},{"uri":"Persian","surface_form":"Persian","offset":1146},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":1493},{"uri":"Sultan","surface_form":"Sultan","offset":1499},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"Emperor","offset":1510},{"uri":"Fount_of_honour","surface_form":"Fount of honour","offset":1545}]}
