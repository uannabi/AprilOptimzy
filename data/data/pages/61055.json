{"id":61055,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whyalla%2C_South_Australia","text":"=\"preserve\">Whyalla is a city on Eyre Peninsula, on the shore of Spencers Gulf, South Australia.\nEconomy.\nIts main industries are associated with the iron ore mines founded by BHP several KM inland.\nOriginal industry.\nOriginally it acted as the port for the export of Iron Ore, then in order to obtain the renewal of the mining lease, BHP was forced by the then government of South Australia to build a blast furnace to smelt the ore into pig iron. This eventually led to the establishment of steel making, and ship building industries, which were very active during the period 1960 - 1980.\nProblems.\nThe viability of these industries so far from markets had progressively declined, culminating in closure of many operations and a decline in the local population. At its peak, during the mid 1980s, about 35,000 people lived there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":25},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":80},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industries","offset":115},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":150},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":155},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mines","offset":159},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":245}]}
