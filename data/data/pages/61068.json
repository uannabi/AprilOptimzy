{"id":61068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus","text":"Erasmus, full name Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus, (28 October, probably 1466 in Rotterdam \u2013 12 July 1536 in Basel) was a Dutch humanist, theologian and philosopher.\nErasmus was a classical scholar who wrote in a \"pure\" Latin style. Although he was a Catholic, he was critical of the Roman Catholic Church and wrote satires of them. He stood at the beginning of the reformation.\nIn 1516, he published a Greek New Testament complete with a new Latin translation.\nSome of his works include Julius Excluded from Heaven, On Civility in Children, The Praise of Folly, Discourse on Free Will, Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style and a Handbook of a Christian Knight.\nAlthough he was an important humanist figure who inspired who had some influence on the younger generations of English Humanists, the scope of Erasmian humanism is quite limited and much of the change that took place in England at this time stemmed from the influence of new religious thinking rather than simply scholarly Renaissance humanism.\nThe term Erasmianism is defined as the body of ideas that is associated with Erasmus and his followers. *","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rotterdam","surface_form":"Rotterdam","offset":81},{"uri":"Basel","surface_form":"Basel","offset":109},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":122},{"uri":"Humanism","surface_form":"humanist","offset":128},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theologian","offset":138},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":153},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":220},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":251},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":284},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":316},{"uri":"Reformation","surface_form":"reformation","offset":366},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":409}]}
