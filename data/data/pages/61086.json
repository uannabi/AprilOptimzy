{"id":61086,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins","text":"Clinton Richard Dawkins DSc, FRS, FRSL (born Nairobi, 26 March 1941) is an English biologist, evolutionist, and writer. He is an emeritus Fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Simonyi Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008.\nDawkins is an atheist, a vice president of the British Humanist Association, and a supporter of the Brights movement. He is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 2006 book \"The God Delusion\", Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion\u2014\"a fixed false belief\". As of January 2010, the English-language version had sold more than two million copies and had been translated into 31 languages.\nDawkins' ideas on evolution were heavily influenced by W.D. Hamilton. The influence can be seen throughout Dawkins' book \"The Selfish Gene\". They became friends at Oxford and, after Hamilton's death, Dawkins wrote his obituary and organised a secular memorial service.\nHe also writes for The Huffington Post.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Doctor_of_Science","surface_form":"DSc","offset":24},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":29},{"uri":"Royal_Society_of_Literature","surface_form":"FRSL","offset":34},{"uri":"Nairobi","surface_form":"Nairobi","offset":45},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":83},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":94},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"emeritus Fellow","offset":129},{"uri":"New_College%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"New College, Oxford","offset":148},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"University of Oxford","offset":181},{"uri":"Atheist","surface_form":"atheist","offset":294},{"uri":"British_Humanist_Association","surface_form":"British Humanist Association","offset":327},{"uri":"Brights","surface_form":"Brights","offset":380},{"uri":"Creationism","surface_form":"creationism","offset":436},{"uri":"Intelligent_design","surface_form":"intelligent design","offset":452},{"uri":"The_God_Delusion","surface_form":"The God Delusion","offset":490},{"uri":"W.D._Hamilton","surface_form":"W.D.
