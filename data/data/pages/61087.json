{"id":61087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalactite","text":"A stalactite is a form that can be found on the ceiling of a cave. When a drop of water flows down the stalactite, the water evaporates and leaves a mineral deposit of calcite. This slowly increases the length and thickness of the stalactite.\nThe corresponding formation on the floor underneath a stalactite is known as a stalagmite. Given enough time, these formations can meet. The results are known as columns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stalagmite","surface_form":"stalagmite","offset":322},{"uri":"Column","surface_form":"column","offset":405}]}
