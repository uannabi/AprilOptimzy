In 2013, he was signed to Ultra Music and Sony Entertainment.\nCareer.\nErix was raised on Long Island, New York. He began performing professionally as a DJ/Emcee at age nine and signed his first management and recording contract as a pop singer at the age of 14 with Louis J. Pearlman, the boyband mogul behind Orlando based Transcontinental Records. Pearlman was later arrested for embezzling 300 million dollars in one of the largest ponzi schemes in US history and also stood accused of molesting several members of the famous groups he managed.\nAfter Pearlman's downfall, Erix signed a record deal with I.D Music in Denmark and Chappell Music Scandinavia. His early musical efforts with that label found popularity on MySpace which led to an online TV series with the social network called Journey Of A Rock Star. Songs from his album \"For Conformity\" amassed millions of online streams and received airplay on international media networks such as MTV Japan and MNET South Africa before landing Ian's single, \"Confessions Of A Killer\" in the top 10 in Asia.\nIn 2010, Erix entered into a deal with Universal Music Group in Germany but his album release was held up for years when the record company began restructuring and his former A&R and manager, Nik Hafemann, left the label to become a judge on a German reality TV series. During this time, Erix continued to cultivate his presence online and released demo versions of new songs he had been working on such as \"Squeaky Clean\", a pop-punk satire of Disney Channel stars, as well as \"So Scene, So See Through (A Song For Mutts)\" which ultimately inspired the name of Erix's fandom and social justice movement, the \"Mutt Army\". Amidst it's online popularity, Ian was invited to perform the song on MTV UK in a special live session that was recorded for the network in their London studio. Another single from that period, \"The Human Race\" was featured in Season 3 Episode 19 of the popular TV show 90210 on The CW network in the USA and worldwide on Netflix.\nIn 2012, Erix begain to appear as a performer and television presenter in numerous countries around the globe at festivals such as Tomorrowland in Belgium and Ultra Music Festival Europe.

The song was originally ranked second but it eventually won the vote to be named \"Best Song of the Summer\". The track climbed to the top of the single charts for several consecutive weeks reaching number 3 on national radio charts. Overall, the song was the fourth most played radio song in Finland in 2014 and on 24 July 2014, it was announced to have sold enough copies to be awarded gold record status.

Each song tells a different story, ranging from pain and loss and a fractured spirit to rebellion, anti-conformity and overcoming adversity. The video series was based on Ian's personal life experiences as a survivor of childhood abuse and the aftermath of the tragic 2013 deaths of both his dad and grandfather, which have been alleged as homicides.\nIn 2017, Ian linked up with British boyband Union J to play 17 dates across the UK throughout the month of February He previewed new material from his forthcoming album on that tour and announced his new LP would likely be called \"Renegade\".
