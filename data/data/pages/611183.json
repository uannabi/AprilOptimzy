{"id":611183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granola","text":"Granola is a breakfast food and snack food made up of rolled oats, nuts, honey or other sweeteners such as brown sugar, and sometimes puffed rice, that is usually baked until it is crisp, toasted and golden brown.\nDuring the baking process, the mixture is stirred to maintain a loose breakfast cereal consistency. Dried fruit, such as raisins and dates, and confections such as chocolate are sometimes added.\nGranola, particularly if it includes flax seeds, is often used to improve digestion. Granola is often eaten in combination with yogurt, honey, fresh fruit (such as bananas, strawberries or blueberries), milk or other forms of cereal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breakfast","surface_form":"breakfast","offset":13},{"uri":"Snack_food","surface_form":"snack food","offset":32},{"uri":"Rolled_oats","surface_form":"rolled oats","offset":54},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nuts","offset":67},{"uri":"Honey","surface_form":"honey","offset":73},{"uri":"Brown_sugar","surface_form":"brown sugar","offset":107},{"uri":"Puffed_rice","surface_form":"puffed rice","offset":134},{"uri":"Dried_fruit","surface_form":"Dried fruit","offset":314},{"uri":"Raisin","surface_form":"raisin","offset":335},{"uri":"Date_palm","surface_form":"dates","offset":347},{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":378},{"uri":"Yogurt","surface_form":"yogurt","offset":537},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":573},{"uri":"Strawberry","surface_form":"strawberries","offset":582},{"uri":"Blueberries","surface_form":"blueberries","offset":598},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":612},{"uri":"Breakfast_cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":635}]}
