{"id":611299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera","text":"The Yellowstone Caldera is a volcanic caldera and supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park in the Western United States. It is sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone Supervolcano. The caldera and most of the park are in the northwest corner of Wyoming.\nThe caldera is about 55 by 72 km. It was formed during the last of the three supereruptions that occurred over the last 2.1 million years.\nVolcanism at Yellowstone is relatively recent. The calderas lie over a hotspot under the Yellowstone Plateau. Light and hot magma (molten rock) from the mantle rises toward the surface. The hotspot is much deeper than the terrain: it is stationary, while the North American Plate moves west-southwest over it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caldera","surface_form":"caldera","offset":38},{"uri":"Yellowstone_National_Park","surface_form":"Yellowstone National Park","offset":66},{"uri":"Western_United_States","surface_form":"Western United States","offset":99},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":247},{"uri":"Km","surface_form":"km","offset":286},{"uri":"Hotspot_(geology)","surface_form":"hotspot","offset":466},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":519},{"uri":"Mantle_(geology)","surface_form":"mantle","offset":548},{"uri":"North_American_Plate","surface_form":"North American Plate","offset":654}]}
