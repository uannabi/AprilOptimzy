{"id":611325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel","text":"Uriel (,, meaning \u201CGod is my light\u201D or \u201Cfire of God\u201D) is an archangel in Jewish and Christian traditions. The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglicans call him \u201CSaint Uriel the Archangel\u201D or simply \u201CSaint Uriel\u201D.\nIn Judaism and Christianity.\nThe Roman Catholic Church only recognizes three archangels which are mentioned in the Bible: Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. But according to the certain rabbinic and Christian traditions, there are four or even seven archangels, Uriel is generally the fourth. In the Deuterocanonical book 2 Esdras, Uriel is sent by God to answer the questions which are asked by Ezra.\nThe role of Uriel in Christian apocryphal traditions is different from answering Ezra's questions. He is said to have rescued John the Baptist from the Massacre of the Innocents(the murder of all boys under the age of two in the area of Bethlehem) as a child and reunited him and his mother Saint Elizabeth with John's cousin, Jesus. This is shown in Leonardo da Vinci's painting \"Virgin of the Rocks.\"\nUriel is often described as a cherub and the angel of repentance and is the angel at the Gate of Eden. In \"The Apocalypse of Peter\", Uriel is shown to be as cruel as any demon when enforcing repentance. He is also supposed to be one of the angels that buried Adam and Abel in Eden.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Archangel","surface_form":"archangel","offset":60},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":73},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":84},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox","offset":110},{"uri":"Oriental_Orthodox","surface_form":"Oriental Orthodox","offset":128},{"uri":"Anglicans","surface_form":"Anglicans","offset":150},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":255},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":337},{"uri":"Michael_(archangel)","surface_form":"Michael","offset":344},{"uri":"Gabriel","surface_form":"Gabriel","offset":353},{"uri":"Raphael_(archangel)","surface_form":"Raphael","offset":365},{"uri":"2_Esdras","surface_form":"2 Esdras","offset":539},{"uri":"Ezra","surface_form":"Ezra","offset":613},{"uri":"Apocrypha","surface_form":"apocryphal","offset":650},{"uri":"John_the_Baptist","surface_form":"John the Baptist","offset":745},{"uri":"Leonardo_da_Vinci","surface_form":"Leonardo da Vinci","offset":970}]}
