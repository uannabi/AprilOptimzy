We can't see them, but we can represent them with symbols, and use them to study the world.\nFictionalism.\nMathematicians who believe in Fictionalism think that math is just made up. Numbers, shapes and other things in math are just ways that we use to make science possible, but they don't really exist.\nLogicism.\nMathematicians who believe in Logicism believe that math is true because it is based on true sentences (called axioms). It does not matter if numbers and shapes exist, or not, just that they represent true things.\nFinitism.\nMathematicians who believe in Finitism think that everything that makes sense has a beginning and an end. Things like infinity don't exist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Platonism","surface_form":"Platonism","offset":41},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"world","offset":192},{"uri":"Fictionalism","surface_form":"Fictionalism","offset":243},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"Numbers","offset":289},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shapes","offset":298},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":364},{"uri":"Logicism","surface_form":"Logicism","offset":451},{"uri":"Finitism","surface_form":"Finitism","offset":675},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinity","offset":763}]}
