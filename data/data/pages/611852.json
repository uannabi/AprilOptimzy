{"id":611852,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarilo","text":"e=\"preserve\">Jarilo (Cyrillic: \u042F\u0440\u0438\u043B\u043E, \u042F\u0440\u0438\u043B\u0430 or \u0408\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043B\u043E) is a Slavic god of vegetation, fertility and springtime.\nThe only historical source that mentions Jarilo was from a German bishop who encountered pagans celebrating a festival called Gerovit (likely a German way of saying, \"Jarovit\"). Until the 19th century in Russia, Belarus and Serbia, folk festivals called \"Jarilo\" were celebrated in late spring. In these festivals, they worshiped a springtime god. Similar festivals occurred in Croatia and Slovenia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cyrillic_script","surface_form":"Cyrillic","offset":21},{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":60},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":74},{"uri":"Fertility","surface_form":"fertility","offset":86},{"uri":"Spring_(season)","surface_form":"spring","offset":100},{"uri":"German_people","surface_form":"German","offset":171},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":178},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":256},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":316},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":324},{"uri":"Serbia","surface_form":"Serbia","offset":336},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":490},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":502}]}
