{"id":611857,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_the_Victorious","text":"Eric the Victorious (Old Norse: Eir\u00EDkr inn sigrs\u00E6li; Swedish: Erik Segers\u00E4ll) was the first Kingdom of Sweden. There is debate about whether or not he was actually the first king.\nHe is sometimes called Eric V or Eric VI. He is called this by people who count back from Eric XIV (1560\u201368).\nEric the Victorious originally controlled the area around Uppland. His kingdom may have extended down to Blekinge. He got the name \"victorious,\" because of his victory in the Battle of F\u00FDrisvellir.\nAccording to Adam of Bremen, he was also the King of Denmark after the defeat of Sweyn Forkbeard. He probably also founded the town of Sigtuna, 38 km northeast from downtown Stockholm.\nAdam also dated Eric the Victorious's death as between 992 and 995. He is remembered as a war-like and successful ruler.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse","offset":21},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":53},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Kingdom of Sweden","offset":92},{"uri":"Eric_XIV_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Eric XIV","offset":270},{"uri":"Uppland","surface_form":"Uppland","offset":348},{"uri":"Blekinge","surface_form":"Blekinge","offset":395},{"uri":"Battle_of_F%C3%BDrisvellir","surface_form":"Battle of F\u00FDrisvellir","offset":465},{"uri":"Adam_of_Bremen","surface_form":"Adam of Bremen","offset":501},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":541},{"uri":"Sweyn_Forkbeard","surface_form":"Sweyn Forkbeard","offset":569},{"uri":"Sigtuna","surface_form":"Sigtuna","offset":623},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":662}]}
