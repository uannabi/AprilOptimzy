Baer is known for her works which are minimalist art. She began showing her work at the Fischbach Gallery, New York, and other venues for contemporary art in the mid-1960s.\nIn the late 1960s, Baer was experimenting with color and shifting the visual focus of her work. While working on the series \"The Stations of the Spectrum\" (1967-1969), Baer painted over their white surfaces to make them gray. In 1975 Baer was the subject of a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, showcasing her Minimalist work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seattle%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Seattle, Washington","offset":87},{"uri":"Minimalist","surface_form":"minimalist","offset":146},{"uri":"Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art","surface_form":"Whitney Museum of American Art","offset":562}]}
