{"id":612312,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I","text":"Dotted and dotless \"I\" are two different letters in the Turkish alphabet. One of them (\u0130, i) has a dot above it and the other (I, \u0131) does not. This is true in both the capital and lower case forms of the letters (see the picture).\nSome of the other Turkic languages that use the Latin script, like Azerbaijani and Tatar, also use both kinds of I. But in all these languages, including Turkish, the letter \"j\" does not have a dotted or dotless form, with a dot only on the lower case character (J, j), just like in the Indo-European languages. However, a dotless j, \u0237, does exist in Unicode.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":41},{"uri":"Turkish_alphabet","surface_form":"Turkish alphabet","offset":56},{"uri":"Dot","surface_form":"dot","offset":99},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Turkic languages","offset":249},{"uri":"Latin_script","surface_form":"Latin script","offset":279},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_language","surface_form":"Azerbaijani","offset":298},{"uri":"Tatar_language","surface_form":"Tatar","offset":314},{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European languages","offset":518},{"uri":"Dotless_j","surface_form":"\u0237","offset":565}]}
