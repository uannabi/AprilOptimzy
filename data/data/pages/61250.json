{"id":61250,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis","text":"An ellipsis is a type of punctuation mark. In writing, it is a row of three points (...). Its name comes from the ancient Greek word \"\u1F14\u03BB\u03BB\u03B5\u03B9\u03C8\u03B9\u03C2\" (omission/falling short). Notice that the three dots are not spaced as full points: they are a separate special typographic sign.\nDepending on context and place in a sentence, ellipses can indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, a mysterious or echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. An ellipsis can be used to trail off into silence\u2014for example: \"But I thought he was...\"\nWhen speaking, it can be referred to as \"dot-dot-dot\".\nIn mathematics, different symbols for ellipsis are used to a similar effect. These include the hortizontal ellipsis symbols formula_1 and formula_1, along with vertical ellipsis symbols such as formula_1 and formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punctuation","surface_form":"punctuation","offset":25},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"ancient Greek word","offset":114},{"uri":"Typographic","surface_form":"typographic","offset":256},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":613}]}
