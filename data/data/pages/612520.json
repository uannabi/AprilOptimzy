{"id":612520,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_resistance_movement","text":"The Danish Resistance Movement was an\u00A0underground movement\u00A0organized to resist the\u00A0Nazi German occupation of Denmark\u00A0during\u00A0World War II. Due to the initially lenient arrangements, in which the\u00A0Nazi\u00A0occupation authority allowed the democratic government to stay in power, the resistance movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries.\nBy 1943, many Danes were involved in underground activities, ranging from producing illegal publications to\u00A0spying\u00A0and\u00A0sabotage. Major groups included the communist\u00A0BOPA\u00A0(Danish:\u00A0\"Borgerlige Partisaner\", Civil Partisans) and\u00A0Holger Danske, both based in Copenhagen. Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis, informers and collaborators until 1944. After that date, they also killed some German nationals.\nIn the postwar period, the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings. Studies were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and people learned that there was sometimes improvised and contingent decision making about the targets, with some morally ambiguous choices.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazi German","offset":83},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":109},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":124}]}
