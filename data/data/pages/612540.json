{"id":612540,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_cancer","text":"Uterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, is any type of cancer that starts from the tissue of the uterus. It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries. Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries.\nRisk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer.\nEarly on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop. If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods. When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":58},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":100},{"uri":"Cervical_cancer","surface_form":"cervical cancer","offset":154},{"uri":"Endometrial_cancer","surface_form":"Endometrial cancer","offset":275},{"uri":"Developed_countries","surface_form":"developed countries","offset":416},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":479},{"uri":"Human_papillomavirus","surface_form":"human papillomavirus","offset":503},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":892},{"uri":"Radiation_therapy","surface_form":"radiation therapy","offset":906},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":928}]}
