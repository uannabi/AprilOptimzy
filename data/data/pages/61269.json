He currently plays for the Florida Panthers.\nPlaying career.\nRoberto Luongo started playing in the NHL with the Florida Panthers. During the summer of 2006, Luongo was planning to stay in Florida. Instead, the general manager of the Panthers, Mike Keenan, sent him to the Vancouver Canucks, along with Lukas Krajicek, in return for Todd Bertuzzi, Alex Auld, and Bryan Allen. Luongo first said that he was sad because he was leaving so suddenly and Vancouver was very far away.\nIn the 2007 season, Luongo was in Vancouver. He was voted into the All-Star Game as the starting goaltender. The Canucks went to the playoffs. It was Luongo's first time to reach the playoffs. In one game, against the Dallas Stars, he made around 70 saves, which is very close to breaking records.\nOn March 4, 2014, a day before the NHL trade deadline, the Canucks traded Luongo along with prospect Steven Anthony to the Florida Panthers for goaltender Jacob Markstr\u00F6m and centre Shawn Matthias. Luongo's salary will still be retained by the Canucks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":41},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":50},{"uri":"Goaltender","surface_form":"goaltender","offset":61},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":79},{"uri":"Florida_Panthers","surface_form":"Florida Panthers","offset":136},{"uri":"Florida_Panthers","surface_form":"Florida Panthers","offset":221},{"uri":"General_manager","surface_form":"general manager","offset":319},{"uri":"Lukas_Krajicek","surface_form":"Lukas Krajicek","offset":411},{"uri":"Todd_Bertuzzi","surface_form":"Todd Bertuzzi","offset":441},{"uri":"Alex_Auld","surface_form":"Alex Auld","offset":456},{"uri":"Bryan_Allen","surface_form":"Bryan Allen","offset":471},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":557},{"uri":"Dallas_Stars","surface_form":"Dallas Stars","offset":804},{"uri":"Florida_Panthers","surface_form":"Florida Panthers","offset":1007},{"uri":"Jacob_Markstr%C3%B6m","surface_form":"Jacob Markstr\u00F6m","offset":1039},{"uri":"Shawn_Matthias","surface_form":"Shawn Matthias","offset":1066}]}
