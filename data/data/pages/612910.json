She begins having dreams, where she is a boy living in Tokyo. She learns that she wrote \"Who are you?\" on a notebook. Taki is a high school boy living in Tokyo. He is also having dreams where he is Mitsuha. He learns that they can switch bodies when they wake up. They begin communicating with each other. Taki leaves notes in Mitsuha's notebook and Mitsuha leaves memos in Taki's phone. They change each other's lives during this time.\nWhen Taki is being Mitsuha, he goes with Mitsuha's grandmother and sister to a shrine far away from town. They leave \"kuchikamizake\" there as an offering to the village god. Mitsuha's note on Taki's phone tells Taki that a comet will pass Japan in the sky. Taki wakes up in his body. He tries to call Mitsuha on his cell phone but it could not reach, before the body switching ends. Taki, and his friends, Miki and Tsukasa, arrive in the region, where they learn that the town was destroyed by a comet and all memos of Mitsuha were erased from Taki's phone. They also learn that five hundred people were listed who used to live there. To reconnect his mind with Mitsuha's, Taki goes to the shrine, drinks her sake bottle and ends up remembering her past.\nTaki wakes up in Mitsuha's body and learns that their dreams will fade away. Mitsuha and her friends plan to help everyone evacuate the town, by hijacking the broadcast station. Taki notices that he is in Mitsuha's body and Mitsuha in Taki's body. They unite at the shrine, but they are at three years apart. When twilight (\"kataware-doki\") occurs, they see each other. They try to write each other's name on their hands, but Mitsuha disappears and twilight ends. Taki no longer remembers Mitsuha, after getting his body back. Before returning to her family, Mitsuha realizes that her memories of Taki faded away, and finds a writing that he wrote \"I love you\" instead of his name. Despite the successful evacuation, the comet falls through Japan and destroys the town, while Taki wakes up in the present day.\nFive years later, Taki has been graduated from university. He researches about the history of the town, and learns that everyone survived after the evacuation, under orders from the mayor and Mitsuha's father. Taki and Mitsuha leave the train station and arrive at the staircase. They see each other and recognize themselves they met before and ask for their names.\nProduction.\nShinkai began writing the script for the movie in 2014. He said that he used one of his other movies, \"Cross Road\" to create the story. The story was inspired by many things.
