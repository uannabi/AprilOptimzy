{"id":613086,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-nationalism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Eco-nationalism (or ecological nationalism) is the belief that a country should not use any foreign energy source, and should instead make their own clean energy. Eco-nationalism could also be a belief that a country's native species and landscapes are a part of it's cultural identity, and should be protected.\nExamples.\nEco-nationalist ideas were used in Estonian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian independence movements in the 1980's. Supporters were particularly against nuclear energy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ecological","surface_form":"ecological","offset":33},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalism","offset":44},{"uri":"Alternative_energy","surface_form":"clean energy","offset":162},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":239},{"uri":"Landscape","surface_form":"landscape","offset":251},{"uri":"Estonia","surface_form":"Estonian","offset":370},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuanian","offset":380},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":395},{"uri":"Nuclear_energy","surface_form":"nuclear energy","offset":480}]}
