He won many music competitions when he was young and became famous because of this. His mother was a cruel piano teacher. She died and K\u014Dsei had a mental breakdown while playing the piano. Because of this, he can't hear the sound of his piano even though his hearing is fine.\nAfter two years, K\u014Dsei has not played the piano and he sees the world in monochrome. He keeps living his life with his friends Tsubaki and Watari. He meets Kaori Miyazono, a fourteen-year-old violinist that plays very freely. Kaori helps K\u014Dsei play music again. K\u014Dsei knows that he loves her, but she already likes Watari. Kaori forces K\u014Dsei to do a performance with her. Kaori suddenly collapses after the performance and was sent to the hospital. Kaori tells K\u014Dsei that she is anemic but this is a lie. She had collapsed many times before when she was younger.\nWhen Kaori comes back from the hospital, she invites K\u014Dsei to play at a Gala with her. Kaori doesn't show up on the day of the Gala. As her health gets worse, she begins to give up on life and wants to kill herself. Kousei helps her keep going by playing a duet with Nagi Aiza, the sister of a fellow rival of his. After this, Kaori chooses to have a dangerous surgery that will kill her if it fails, just so that she can play with him one more time.\nKaori dies because of the surgery. K\u014Dsei gets a letter from Kaori that is given to him by her parents at her funeral. The letter says that she was in love with K\u014Dsei the whole time, and she lied that she liked Watari.
