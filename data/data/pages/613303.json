It was produced by Rita Jhawar Music was by Sanjib Sarkar.\nPlot.\nParadiso The Film is a movie that is at once comic, and also intensely profound and tragic. Though set in 1960's, in a city, somewhere resembling Kolkata, in India, yet, the story is relevant, now all the more. In fact, the theme of the movie is timeless. The loneliness of a man who mirrors the perception of his family, because of his self imposed silence is at once hilarious as well dark. In a way it mirrors the emptiness of our soul. The man lives in the world, one 'Real', one 'Imagined' till the point where both collide and become one. To see the movie is at once humbling and profound.\nMusic & Audio.\nThe Film's Music, was done by Sanjib Sarkar,\nLyrics by Dushyant & Sudeep Ranjan Sarkar Sung by Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sadhana Sargam, Sukanya & Tirtha,\nSong Recorded & Mix From Octave Studio Kolkata, Under the banner of Nez Moving Pixels","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":28},{"uri":"Sudeep_Ranjan_Sarkar","surface_form":"Sudeep Ranjan Sarkar","offset":61},{"uri":"Rita_Jhawar","surface_form":"Rita Jhawar","offset":102},{"uri":"Sanjib_Sarkar","surface_form":"Sanjib Sarkar","offset":127},{"uri":"Comic","surface_form":"comic","offset":193},{"uri":"Kolkata","surface_form":"Kolkata","offset":294},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":306},{"uri":"Timeless","surface_form":"timeless","offset":394},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"soul","offset":582},{"uri":"Film","surface_form":"Film","offset":763},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"Music","offset":770},{"uri":"Sanjib_Sarkar","surface_form":"Sanjib Sarkar","offset":789},{"uri":"Dushyant","surface_form":"Dushyant","offset":814},{"uri":"Sudeep_Ranjan_Sarkar","surface_form":"Sudeep Ranjan Sarkar","offset":825},{"uri":"Kavita_Krishnamurthy","surface_form":"Kavita Krishnamurthy","offset":854},{"uri":"Sadhana_Sargam","surface_form":"Sadhana Sargam","offset":876},{"uri":"Octave_Studio_Kolkata","surface_form":"Octave Studio Kolkata","offset":935}]}
