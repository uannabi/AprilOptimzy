Shivakumar, or Shiv as he is popularly known, is a Bangalore born leader and a management thinker.\nHe is currently the Group Executive President, Corporate Strategy at Aditya Birla Group. Previously, Shivakumar was the Chairperson & Chief Executive Officer at PepsiCo Holdings Private Limited, India. Prior to that, Shivakumar was Senior Vice President for Emerging Markets at Nokia Telecommunications.\nEarly life and education.\nShivakumar was born and raised in Bangalore, India.\nHe graduated from IIT, Madras in 1982 and from IIM, Calcutta in 1984. In 2005, he went on to study at The Wharton School.\nPre-Nokia.\nShivakumar started his career as a management trainee in the Consumer Products Division at Hindustan Ciba Geigy before shifting toHindustan Unilever Limited where he spent 19 years in sales, marketing and general management positions. He handled consumer major Hindustan Unilever\u2019s foods business between 1989-97, leading brands like Lipton tea, Tree Top fruit juices and Waffles wafers in the snacks segment, before moving to handle shampoos, feminine hygiene and baby products.\nHe moved to Philips India as Chief Executive Officer of the consumer electronics division in 2003.\nNokia (India and Worldwide).\nShivakumar joined Nokia in 2006 as the Managing Director, India.\n\"He opened up the Indian market to mobile phones using the HUL style of ensuring good distribution, branding and making the product available at various price points for different sets of consumers.\" V Balaraman, ex-CEO, Ponds.\nThe robust supply chain Shivakumar had helped build was tested during the battery crisis of 2007, in which Nokia India had to recall millions of devices due to defective batteries. How the company handled this situation later became a case study covered by the Indian School of Business.\nApart from robust supply chains, Shivakumar also oversaw product innovation at Nokia. Under his management, Nokia India launched a range of services, from Music to Agriculture, under the banner of Nokia Life Tools. The introduction of the phone torch, which was a runaway success as users found it a handy solution in case of power cuts, was also a major milestone during his time.\nDuring his time at Nokia, the brand also built a salience within the Indian households by repeatedly betting big on cricket. The brand started its long-lasting tie-up with the Kolkata Knight Riders, owned by its brand ambassador Shah Rukh Khan. Nokia also sponsored the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 and the 2009 T20 World Cup, under Shivakumar\u2019s management. In fact, Nokia India was one of the few brands willing to bet on Indian cricket and sponsor the first T20 World Cup hosted by South Africa in 2007, in which India defeated Pakistan in the finals.\nShivakumar moved on to become Sr. Vice President, Emerging Markets (India, Middle East, Africa) in 2011, handling a market that accounted for 40% of Nokia\u2019s global business and comprised of around 90 countries.\nShivakumar\u2019s time at Nokia is both praised and criticized. He is credited for driving Nokia\u2019s brand from No. 71 to No. 1 in the country increasing their national market share from 46% to 56% by 2006. But he also saw it dip to 30% by 2011 and, towards the end of his time at Nokia, the brand was facing stiff competition in India from smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung.\nLooking back at his time at Nokia, Shivakumar points out that Nokia fell behind as the mobile market shifted almost overnight from voice to content-driven open operating systems like Android. He acknowledges that while the strategy they pursued at the time delivered, it did not foresee this sudden shift.\nHowever, he believes in the humble, honest, caring and empathetic culture of Nokia and is of the opinion that its brand equity is still intact.\nHis contributions from this time have become case studies at Ivy League institutes like Harvard University and the Indian School of Business.\nIn fact, the Harvard Case Study titled \u2018Emerging Nokia?\u2019 looks at the successful strategies that Nokia adopted globally during Shivakumar\u2019s time as the Managing Director of the Indian market. It examines how Nokia tapped into the emerging markets like China, India and the MEA while turning its back towards markets like Europe, Japan and the USA. The study looks at Shivakumar and his counterparts Colin Giles (heading the Chinese market) and Chris Braam (heading the MEA market).\nPepsiCo India.\nIn 2013, Shivakumar was appointed as the Chairperson & Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo Holdings Private Limited, India where he managed brand portfolios across beverages, snacks and nutrition. He is known for being the key driver for portfolio transformation and depended consumer engagement with flagship brands.\nShivakumar is one of India\u2019s most respected business leaders. He has a proven ability to take billion-dollar businesses to the next level by maximizing innovation, execution and collaboration.\nUnder his leadership, PepsiCo launched brands like Quaker, Tropicana and Doritos in the Indian market. He was also the Chairman of Nourishco (which was a joint venture between PepsiCo and Tata Global Beverages). He and then Vice President of the nutrition category for PepsiCo India, Deepika Warrier, headed the launch of Quaker Oats+Milk, which had Sachin Tendulkar as the brand ambassador.\nShivakumar was at the helm when PepsiCo announced in 2013 that it was investing INR 33,000 crores in the Indian market to expand production and distribution.\nHe also oversaw the much talked about Pepsi walkout from the Indian Premier League. Pepsi ended its title sponsorship with IPL in 2015, two years before the 5-year contract was set to expire by 2017. This pulling out of the contract was due to the match-fixing scandals that had brought disrepute to the league.\nApart from overseeing India operations, he also managed PepsiCo\u2019s franchise business across Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.\n\u201CHe has been a key driver for portfolio transformation, helped develop our nutrition business, launching innovations with our Quaker and Tropicana brands and deepened consumer engagement with our flagship brands.\u201D\nAditya Birla Group.\nAs of January 2018, Shivakumar has joined Aditya Birla Group as the Group Executive President, Corporate Strategy & Business Development. In his current role, he reports directly to the Chairman of the Group, Kumara Mangalam Birla.\nHe heads the white cement business and the global textile business from the Group.\nAditya Birla Group is one of the largest Indian conglomerates with businesses spread across telecommunications, cement, chemicals, mining, textiles, financial services, retail and e-commerce, among others, in 36 countries.\nLeadership style.\nD. Shivakumar is known for his friendly, approachable leadership style. At PepsiCo, he used to alternate between two offices every week to ensure his visibility and accessibility to the people he worked with. One of his offices also merely had a round table, to facilitate teamwork and collaboration.\nAt his time in Nokia too, people who have closely worked with Shivakumar said that one of his biggest contributions was to drive leadership within the organisation.\nChris Weber, EVP Sales And Marketing Nokia said in 2013, \u201CIn addition to what Shiv has done for Nokia externally \u2013 his personal convictions on the importance of leadership have resonated throughout the company.\u201D\n\u201CHe has been the de-facto HR manager and the best channel of communication between the junior most guy on the field to the head of businesses or units,\u201D said Poonam Kaul, Director, Communications, Nokia India.\nManagement thinker.\nShivakumar regularly discusses his thoughts on various topics with relation to management. From pointing out how the post of General Manager had slowly become irrelevant post globalization to what skills a fresh pass-out from an MBA school should possess to what the relationship between the individual leader and the company should be, Shivakumar engages with management theories by publishing articles and blogs.\nHe also shares his knowledge with corporate and college students alike by taking courses and appearing for guest lectures.\nShivakumar has published his thoughts and experiences in a book titled \u2018Reflections\u2019. He is currently working on his second book.\nPersonal life.\nShivakumar is an avid reader who regularly puts out his reading list and book reviews. He looks up to management gurus and leaders like Peter Drucker, Jack Welch, Robert McNamara and Harold Geneen as role models.\nShivakumar is also an avid sports watcher, following both the Manchester United and Barcelona football teams.
