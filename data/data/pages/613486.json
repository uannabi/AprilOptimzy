{"id":613486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabarnia","text":"Tabarnia (\"Tab\u00E0rnia\" in Catalan) is a suggested name and a satirical political project for a portion of the Catalonian territory, Spain. It was created by the organization \"Barcelona is not Catalonia\" (AKA \"Plataforma por la Autonom\u00EDa de Barcelona\", \"Movement for an Autonomous Barcelona\") as a satirical response towards the Catalonians separatists. Their main target is to establish up a new region in Spain besides Catalonia with some districts (\"Comarcas\" or \"Comarques\") from the provinces of Barcelona and Tarragona.\nProponents believes the area somewhat corresponds to the historic County of Barcelona, although its extension is considerably different.\nBackground.\nOn 24th September, 2012; \"Barcelona is not Catalonia\"'s members approved in a constituent assembly their statutes and a political program in order to get their own autonomy as an Autonomous Community within Spain.\nProcess of Independence of Catalonia.\nProponents of Tabarnia demands to segregate themselves from the Catalan separatist movement\u00A0and reclaims the right of a number of territories near the area of Barcelona and Tarragona\u00A0to constitute themselves as an Autonomous Community within Spain. In the 2015 and 2017 Catalan regional elections, parties opposed to secession (mainly\u00A0C's, PSC and\u00A0PP) received a majority of votes and seats in some of these \"comarques\" (Tarragon\u00E8s, Baix Pened\u00E8s, Garraf and Baix Llobregat) including the city of Tarragona, but excluding the most populated Catalan city: Barcelona.\nThey allude to a series of fiscal arguments similar to those of Catalan separatism in regards to Spain., although in last Catalan election, Tarragona province showed more support for separatism than unionism.\nTrending Topic.\nIn December, 2017 the satirical movement became trending topic in the social networks. Since then, they had been appear in Spanish and international media. According them, \"Tabarnia is a historical region that comprised the ancient County of Barcelona, currently part of Tarragona and Barcelona provinces\".\nReactions.\nThe rise of this movement creates tension among the Catalan separatist movement because of argumental contradiction and geostrategic risk using their same arguments for independence word by word. as a result, the catalan separatists contradicts themselves when they uses the \"unionist\" counter-arguments in order to discredit the Tabarnia movement. The territorial area that Tabarnia would comprise includes geostrategic assets that are fundamental for a viable independent Catalonia. The Port of Barcelona and Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport, some of the richest industrial sectors fall in fact inside areas that hold a majority of voters in favor of unionism, though in the city of Barcelona the pro-independence won the election.\nThe fact that Tabarnians are asking to be separated from the Catalonia that wants to be separated from Spain, has been interpreted by some newspapers as a\u00A0reductio ad absurdum\u00A0of the nationalistic logic in a XXI century Europe. Many Tabarnians believe that a sustained international media attention to this movement would defeat the catalan independence project by simply following their own arguments instead of opposing them.\nAn ongoing petition is taking place at Change.org in order to be sent to the Spanish Congress of Deputies to consider the creation of this new autonomous region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Catalan_language","surface_form":"Catalan","offset":24},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satirical political","offset":59},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalonian territory","offset":108},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":130},{"uri":"Catalan_independence","surface_form":"Catalonians separatists","offset":326},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":498},{"uri":"Tarragona","surface_form":"Tarragona","offset":512},{"uri":"County_of_Barcelona","surface_form":"County of Barcelona","offset":589},{"uri":"Catalan_regional_election%2C_2015","surface_form":"2015","offset":1180},{"uri":"Catalan_regional_election%2C_2017","surface_form":"2017","offset":1189},{"uri":"Citizens_(Spanish_political_party)","surface_form":"C's","offset":1259},{"uri":"Socialists%27_Party_of_Catalonia","surface_form":"PSC","offset":1264},{"uri":"People%27s_Party_of_Catalonia","surface_form":"PP","offset":1272},{"uri":"Trending_topic","surface_form":"trending topic","offset":1762},{"uri":"Social_networking_service","surface_form":"social networks","offset":1784},{"uri":"The_Port_of_Barcelona","surface_form":"The Port of Barcelona","offset":2517},{"uri":"Barcelona%E2%80%93El_Prat_Airport","surface_form":"Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport","offset":2543},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":2710},{"uri":"Change.org","surface_form":"Change.org","offset":3226},{"uri":"Congress_of_Deputies","surface_form":"Congress of Deputies","offset":3272}]}
