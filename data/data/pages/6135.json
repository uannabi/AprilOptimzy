{"id":6135,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No","text":"e=\"preserve\">No is an English word which has a negative meaning. It is the antonym (opposite) of the word Yes, which is a positive term.\nNo is used when someone is denying or turning away something. It can also be used in different figures of speech.\nIn both sentences and talking, the words \"No\" and the word \"Not\" can both be used, though the word \"No\" is mainly used when speaking to other people. In some cases, however, \"Not\" is not acceptable, and vice versa. These words are not to be confused with the similar sounding words know and knot.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":22},{"uri":"Negative","surface_form":"negative","offset":47},{"uri":"Antonym","surface_form":"antonym","offset":75},{"uri":"Yes","surface_form":"Yes","offset":106},{"uri":"Positive","surface_form":"positive","offset":122},{"uri":"Figure_of_speech","surface_form":"figures of speech","offset":232},{"uri":"Not","surface_form":"Not","offset":311},{"uri":"Know","surface_form":"know","offset":533},{"uri":"Knot","surface_form":"knot","offset":542}]}
