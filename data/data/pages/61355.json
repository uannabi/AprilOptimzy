The city has a population of 410,956 people. The name Dodoma means \"It has sunk\".\nHistory.\nDuring German colonial rule in East Africa, the town of Dodoma was founded at the same time as the creation of the Tanzanian central railway. The British took over the city after World War I. Dodoma became an administrative center for the region until the independence of Tanzania in 1964. In 1973, plans were made to move the capital from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma. Tanzania's National Assembly moved there the next year. Many government offices are still in Dar es Salaam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":14},{"uri":"Tanzania","surface_form":"Tanzania","offset":30},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":64},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":76},{"uri":"Dodoma_Region","surface_form":"Dodoma region","offset":121},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":151},{"uri":"Sunk","surface_form":"sunk","offset":211},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":234},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonial","offset":241},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":258},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"founded","offset":294},{"uri":"Central_Line_(Tanzania)","surface_form":"Tanzanian central railway","offset":342},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":373},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":406},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative","offset":436},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":466},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":483},{"uri":"1964","surface_form":"1964","offset":511},{"uri":"Dar_es_Salaam","surface_form":"Dar es Salaam","offset":567},{"uri":"National_Assembly","surface_form":"National Assembly","offset":603},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":653},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":664}]}
