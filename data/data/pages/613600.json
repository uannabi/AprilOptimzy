{"id":613600,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Frauenfelder","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hans Frauenfelder (born June 28, 1922) is a Swiss-American physicist and biophysicist. He was known for his discovery of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) in 1951. In the modern day, PAC spectroscopy is widely used in the study of condensed matter physics.\nFrauenfelder was born in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. He studied at ETH Zurich.\nWithin biophysics, he is known for experiment and theory in understanding the dynamical behavior of protein tertiary structure. In 1992, Frauenfelder won the Max Delbruck Prize.\nFrauenfelder is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Perturbed_angular_correlation","surface_form":"perturbed angular correlation","offset":134},{"uri":"Spectroscopy","surface_form":"spectroscopy","offset":202},{"uri":"Condensed_matter_physics","surface_form":"condensed matter physics","offset":246},{"uri":"Schaffhausen","surface_form":"Schaffhausen","offset":297},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":311},{"uri":"ETH_Zurich","surface_form":"ETH Zurich","offset":338},{"uri":"Biophysics","surface_form":"biophysics","offset":357},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":450},{"uri":"Tertiary_structure","surface_form":"tertiary structure","offset":458},{"uri":"Max_Delbruck_Prize","surface_form":"Max Delbruck Prize","offset":508},{"uri":"United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":560},{"uri":"American_Philosophical_Society","surface_form":"American Philosophical Society","offset":594},{"uri":"Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","offset":654}]}
