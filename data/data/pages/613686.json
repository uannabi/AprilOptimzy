It is exported as the AIM.\nThe Pistol Mitralier\u0103 model 1965 (abbreviated PM md. 65) is the underfolding-stock version of the PM md. 63, and is exported as the AIMS.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1960s, the Romanian Army used mostly PPSh-41, Ori\u0163a submachine guns and imported AK-47 assault rifles. With the development of the stamped Type 4 AKM receiver, and the Soviet Union's call to each of the Warsaw Pact's nations to produce their own assault rifles chambered in 7.62mm, be they AK-47 pattern or not, the Romanian State Arsenal developed an AKM clone featuring a forward-pointing front handgrip molded into the lower handguard, called the Pistol Mitralier\u0103 model 1963 (literally 'machine pistol' model 1963). The underfolding stock version is designated the Pistol Mitralier\u0103 model 1965, and features a rear-pointing front handgrip, allowing the underfolding stock to be completely retracted.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Assault_rifle","surface_form":"assault rifle","offset":72},{"uri":"AKM","surface_form":"AKM","offset":106},{"uri":"7.62%C3%9739mm","surface_form":"7.62\u00D739mm","offset":132},{"uri":"PPSh-41","surface_form":"PPSh-41","offset":377},{"uri":"Orita_M1941","surface_form":"Ori\u0163a","offset":386},{"uri":"AK-47","surface_form":"AK-47","offset":421},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":508},{"uri":"Warsaw_Pact","surface_form":"Warsaw Pact","offset":543}]}
