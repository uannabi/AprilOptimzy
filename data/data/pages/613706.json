{"id":613706,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Division_Series","text":"In Major League Baseball, the National League Division Series (NLDS), played early to mid October, is a playoff round to determine which two National League teams play in the NLCS. It consists of two best-of-five series featuring three division winners and the winner of the wild card game.\nHistory.\nThe first Division Series was played in 1981. A strike shortened the MLB season that year. Division winners from the first half took on the second-half division champions.\nThe Division Series was implemented for good in 1994. The leagues were expanded two three divisions, and the wild card was also added. However, a strike cancelled the rest of the 1994 MLB season, including the playoffs. The current Division Series thus began play in 1995.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":3},{"uri":"National_League","surface_form":"National League","offset":141},{"uri":"National_League_Championship_Series","surface_form":"NLCS","offset":175}]}
