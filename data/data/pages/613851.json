{"id":613851,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element","text":"e=\"preserve\">The inverse element is the opposite of a number or equation. The inverses of formula_1 in addition is formula_1 (called the additive inverse), and formula_1 or formula_1 in multiplication (called the multiplicative inverse, or reciprocal).\nIn general, given an element \"g\" in a group \"S\" equipped with an operation formula_1, an inverse element of \"g\" is an element \"g*\" such that formula_1 and formula_1 are both equal to the identity element (of the group). Other examples of inverse include inverse function and matrix inverse.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opposite_number","surface_form":"opposite","offset":40},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":64},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":103},{"uri":"Additive_inverse","surface_form":"additive inverse","offset":137},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":186},{"uri":"Multiplicative_inverse","surface_form":"multiplicative inverse","offset":213},{"uri":"Group_(mathematics)","surface_form":"group","offset":291},{"uri":"Identity_element","surface_form":"identity element","offset":440},{"uri":"Inverse_function","surface_form":"inverse function","offset":507},{"uri":"Matrix_inverse","surface_form":"matrix inverse","offset":528}]}
