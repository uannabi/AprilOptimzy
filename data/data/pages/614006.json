{"id":614006,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Division_Series","text":"=\"preserve\">In Major League Baseball, the American League Division Series (ALDS) is played from the beginning to the middle of October, and decides which two teams in the American League will play in the American League Championship Series. It consists of two best series out of the five series featuring three division winners, and the winner of the wild card game. Each series is completed once a team has won three games.\nHistory.\nThe first Division Series was played in the strike shortened 1981 MLB season. Teams in first place before the strike took on teams in first place after the strike. In 1994, the Division Series was added for good. Both leagues were split in to three divisions each; and the wild card was added as well. However, a strike cancelled the rest of the 1994 season, including the playoffs. The current-day Division Series thus began the play in 1995.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":15},{"uri":"American_League","surface_form":"American League","offset":171},{"uri":"American_League_Championship_Series","surface_form":"American League Championship Series","offset":204}]}
