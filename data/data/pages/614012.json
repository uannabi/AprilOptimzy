{"id":614012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_N_Roll_McDonald%27s","text":"The Rock N Roll McDonald's (formerly The Original Rock 'N Roll McDonald's) is a McDonald's restaurant located in Chicago, Illinois. It is one of the most famous McDonald's locations in the world and was once the busiest in the United States.\nThe restaurant, located in the River North section of the Near North Side community area (neighborhood) of Chicago, a few city blocks west of the Magnificent Mile, had been a tourist attraction since it opened in 1983.\nAfter the demolition of the original building, the present building opened in 2005 and originally had a seating capacity of 300. The original 1983 building and the first design of the rebuilt 2005 structure site held a rock and roll exhibit in a building next to the restaurant and a small upstairs McDonald's museum display.\nThe building features the first two-lane McDonald's drive-through, a caf\u00E9, flat panel televisions and a green roof. In 2017, a redesign of the restaurant planned to remove the Rock N Roll theme for a more modernized version set to re-open in Spring 2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":80},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":113},{"uri":"River_North","surface_form":"River North","offset":273},{"uri":"Near_North_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Near North Side","offset":300},{"uri":"Magnificent_Mile","surface_form":"Magnificent Mile","offset":388},{"uri":"Tourist_attraction","surface_form":"tourist attraction","offset":417},{"uri":"Seating_capacity","surface_form":"seating capacity","offset":565},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock and roll","offset":680},{"uri":"Drive-through","surface_form":"drive-through","offset":839},{"uri":"Green_roof","surface_form":"green roof","offset":891}]}
