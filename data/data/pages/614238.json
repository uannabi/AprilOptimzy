{"id":614238,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-dart_finish","text":"A nine-dart finish is a perfect leg (single game) of darts. It is achieved by using the minimum number of darts. The aim of each player is to gradually subtract their score from their initial number of points (501) until they reach 0 (without scoring under), by finishing either on a double or a bullseye.\nOnly a few players have ever managed to perform a nine-dart finish.\nThere are many different scoring combinations how one can manage a nine-dart finish. It is often done by two maximum scores of 180, followed by two triples (one 20 and one lower number) and a winning double.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Darts","surface_form":"darts","offset":53}]}
