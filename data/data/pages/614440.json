He was born in Moscow.\nYankilevsky was known mostly for his work in the Soviet Nonconformist Art movement of the 1960s through the 1980s. His most famous works are his triptychs, works that are hard to classify. His works often create a nightmarish imagery to paint a picture of restrictive mental states about daily life in the Soviet Union, and with the human condition in general.\nYankilevsky was also known for having participated in the Manezh Art Exhibit of 1962, during which Nikita Khrushchev famously chastised the Nonconformist Art Movement as degenerate.\nYankilevsky died in Paris of leukemia on January 4, 2018 at the age of 79.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russian","offset":109},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":140},{"uri":"Soviet_Nonconformist_Art","surface_form":"Soviet Nonconformist Art","offset":197},{"uri":"Triptych","surface_form":"triptych","offset":293},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":454},{"uri":"Nikita_Khrushchev","surface_form":"Nikita Khrushchev","offset":608},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":711},{"uri":"Leukemia","surface_form":"leukemia","offset":720}]}
