{"id":614464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryakuji","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ryakuji (kanji:\u7565\u5B57, kana:\u308A\u3083\u304F\u3058) are shorthand and usually unofficial forms of kanji.\nFor example, \u3005 is a shorthand form of the kanji \u4EDD, which itself is another form of the kanji \u540C, which means \"same\". For compound words where the same kanji is used twice in a row, \u3005 is used where the second kanji would be so that it doesn't have to be written again.\nFor example, the word \"tokidoki\", which means \"from time to time\", uses the same kanji for \"time\" twice, but is written as \u6642\u3005 instead of \u6642\u6642 because Japanese would see the second compound as redundant. So \u3005 implies that the second character is the same as the first.\nThis is similar to English ligatures, or letters that combine to make a new letter or symbol such as &, which was a combination of the letters that make the Latin word \"et\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kanji","surface_form":"kanji","offset":89},{"uri":"Compound_(linguistics)","surface_form":"compound words","offset":216},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":511},{"uri":"Ligature_(typography)","surface_form":"ligatures","offset":656}]}
