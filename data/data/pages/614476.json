The city's largest cemetery, Rosehill Cemetery, is located here.\nGreater Lincoln Square is made up of the smaller neighborhoods of Ravenswood Gardens, Bowmanville, Budlong Woods and Lincoln Square (neighborhood). Although it is sometimes known by these other names the City of Chicago officially designated it as Lincoln Square in 1925.\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Chicago, the neighborhood make-up of Ravenswood and Lincoln Square is a common mistake \u2014 the two are not different. The boundaries of the original Ravenswood subdivision, drawn in 1869, were Montrose, Lawrence, Clark and Damen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":57},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":66},{"uri":"Community_areas_of_Chicago","surface_form":"community areas","offset":110},{"uri":"Rosehill_Cemetery","surface_form":"Rosehill Cemetery","offset":156},{"uri":"Encyclopedia_of_Chicago","surface_form":"Encyclopedia of Chicago","offset":481}]}
