The city blamed the architecture and structure of the balcony. However, the building's owner continues to blame overcrowding on the balcony for its complete structural failure, although he has taken steps to strengthen the balconies at his properties to prevent a recurrence of the disaster.\nThe accident resulted in sweeping inspections of similar structures across Chicago, with 1,260 cases being actioned by the city authorities. It is the deadliest porch collapse in United States history.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Porch_collapse","surface_form":"porch collapse","offset":32},{"uri":"Lincoln_Park%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Lincoln Park, Chicago","offset":84},{"uri":"Balcony","surface_form":"balcony","offset":121},{"uri":"Apartment_building","surface_form":"apartment building","offset":160},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":718}]}
