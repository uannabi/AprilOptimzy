John Byron\u00A0and Sophia Trevanion\u00A0and grandson of\u00A0William Byron, 4th\u00A0Baron Byron of\u00A0Rochdale. He was educated atWestminster School. He gained the rank of Captain\u00A0in the\u00A0Coldstream Guards.\u00A0Captain John Byron also went by the nickname of \"Mad Jack.\"\nIn 1778 he eloped with\u00A0Amelia Osborne, Marchioness of Carmarthen, daughter ofRobert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness, to Europe and they married after she obtained a divorce from her husband the Marquess of Carmarthen, who in 1789 became\u00A0Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds.\u00A0They married on 1 June 1779 at London, England, and had a daughter,\u00A0Augusta Maria Byron. Amelia Osborne died in 1784.\nByron then married Catherine Gordon, heiress of\u00A0Gight\u00A0in\u00A0Aberdeenshire, Scotland, daughter of\u00A0George Gordon\u00A0and Catherine Innes, on 12 May 1785. She was the mother of George Gordon Byron, who would early in his life become the\u00A06th Baron Byron.\u00A0In order to claim his wife's estate in Scotland, Captain Byron took the surname\u00A0\"Gordon\".After he had squandered most of her fortune and deserted her, Mrs. Byron took her infant son to\u00A0Aberdeen, Scotland, where they lived in lodgings on a meager income.\n\"Mad Jack\" died in 1791 at age 35, at Valenciennes. Later,\u00A0Lord Byron\u00A0would tell friends that his father had cut his own throat. It is more likely he died from\u00A0tuberculosis\u00A0or an overdose.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"Captain","offset":13},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":72},{"uri":"Lord_Byron","surface_form":"Lord Byron","offset":138},{"uri":"John_Byron_(Royal_Navy_officer)","surface_form":"John Byron","offset":193},{"uri":"William_Byron%2C_4th_Baron_Byron","surface_form":"William Byron, 4th","offset":241},{"uri":"Baron_Byron","surface_form":"Baron Byron","offset":260},{"uri":"Rochdale","surface_form":"Rochdale","offset":275},{"uri":"Westminster_School","surface_form":"Westminster School","offset":303},{"uri":"Captain","surface_form":"Captain","offset":345},{"uri":"Coldstream_Guards","surface_form":"Coldstream Guards","offset":360},{"uri":"Amelia_Osborne%2C_Marchioness_of_Carmarthen","surface_form":"Amelia Osborne, Marchioness of Carmarthen","offset":462},{"uri":"Robert_Darcy%2C_4th_Earl_of_Holderness","surface_form":"Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness","offset":516},{"uri":"Francis_Osborne%2C_5th_Duke_of_Leeds","surface_form":"Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds","offset":674},{"uri":"Augusta_Leigh","surface_form":"Augusta Maria Byron","offset":778},{"uri":"Gight","surface_form":"Gight","offset":876},{"uri":"Aberdeenshire","surface_form":"Aberdeenshire","offset":885},{"uri":"George_Gordon_of_Gight","surface_form":"George Gordon","offset":922},{"uri":"Lord_Byron","surface_form":"6th Baron Byron","offset":1055},{"uri":"Aberdeen","surface_form":"Aberdeen","offset":1257},{"uri":"Valenciennes","surface_form":"Valenciennes","offset":1364},{"uri":"Lord_Byron","surface_form":"Lord Byron","offset":1385},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":1486}]}
