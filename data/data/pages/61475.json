{"id":61475,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades","text":"The Everglades is a flat tropical river and mangrove swamp. It is in the southern part of Florida near the city of Miami. The Everglades usually has tropical river delta which runs slowly through a low-lying basin near sea level. There are many plants many animals live there. It is the only place in the world where crocodiles and alligators live together. It is a National Park and part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nNational park.\nBeing a national park in the U.S. state of Florida, it helps protect around 25\u00A0percent of the original Everglades. It is the largest subtropical forest in the United States. On average, around one\u00A0million people visit it each year.\nIt is the third-largest national park in the lower 48\u00A0states after Death Valley and Yellowstone. It is an International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, and a Wetland of International Importance. It is one of only three parks in the world to be on all three lists.\nUnlike most national parks in the US, Everglades National Park was started to protect a weak ecosystem and its unique geographic feature. The Everglades are wetlands. It is created by a slow-moving river coming from Lake Okeechobee. It flows through the Kissimmee River to the southwest at about per day, to Florida Bay.\nThe park protects a connected network of marshland and forest ecosystems. They are maintained by natural forces. There are thirty-six species of endangered and threatened living in the park. Some of them are: Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee.\nThe park protects the largest U.S. wilderness area east of the Mississippi River. It is the most significant breeding place for tropical wading birds in North America. It also has the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western hemisphere.\nIt is also home to more than 350\u00A0species of birds, 300\u00A0species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40\u00A0species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles live within Everglades National Park.\nDiversion and quality of water.\nAll of South Florida's fresh water are kept in the Biscayne Aquifer. They are also recharged in the park. Only less than 50\u00A0percent of the Everglades water remain today.\nBetween the 1940s and 2000s, the number of wading birds has become smaller. It has reached around 90\u00A0percent decrease from their original numbers.\nThe diversion of water to South Florida's still-growing metropolitan areas is the number one threat for the park's inhabitants.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, of canals and levees, 150\u00A0gates and spillways, and 16\u00A0pumping stations were built to lead water towards the cities and away from the Everglades. Low levels of water leave many fishes vulnerable to reptiles and birds. As sawgrass dry, it can burn or die off.\nAs a result, many apple snails and other animals that wading birds feed upon, are killed. Populations of birds have been dropping.\nIn 2009, the South Florida Water Management District claimed that the number of wading birds across South Florida have increased by 335%. However, despite three years of reported higher numbers, \"The Miami Herald\" discovered the same year that populations of waders in the park decreased by 29%.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":25},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":34},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":44},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":53},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":90},{"uri":"Miami","surface_form":"Miami","offset":115},{"uri":"River_delta","surface_form":"river delta","offset":158},{"uri":"Basin_(geology)","surface_form":"basin","offset":208},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":219},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":245},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":257},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":305},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":317},{"uri":"Alligator","surface_form":"alligator","offset":332},{"uri":"National_Park","surface_form":"National Park","offset":366},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":396},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":403},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":447},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":482},{"uri":"Subtropics","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":572},{"uri":"Death_Valley","surface_form":"Death Valley","offset":738},{"uri":"Yellowstone_National_Park","surface_form":"Yellowstone","offset":755},{"uri":"International_Biosphere_Reserve","surface_form":"International Biosphere Reserve","offset":777},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":812},{"uri":"Wetland","surface_form":"Wetland","offset":839},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":1038},{"uri":"Lake_Okeechobee","surface_form":"Lake Okeechobee","offset":1161},{"uri":"Kissimmee_River","surface_form":"Kissimmee River","offset":1199},{"uri":"Florida_Bay","surface_form":"Florida Bay","offset":1253},{"uri":"Marsh","surface_form":"marshland","offset":1307},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":1411},{"uri":"Threatened_species","surface_form":"threatened","offset":1426},{"uri":"Puma","surface_form":"panther","offset":1483},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":1505},{"uri":"Manatee","surface_form":"manatee","offset":1536},{"uri":"Wilderness","surface_form":"wilderness","offset":1580},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":1608},{"uri":"Breed","surface_form":"breeding","offset":1654},{"uri":"Wading_bird","surface_form":"wading bird","offset":1682},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":1737},{"uri":"Western_hemisphere","surface_form":"Western hemisphere","offset":1763},{"uri":"Biscayne_Aquifer","surface_form":"Biscayne Aquifer","offset":2046},{"uri":"Filter","surface_form":"recharged","offset":2078},{"uri":"Wader","surface_form":"wading birds","offset":2208},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"inhabitants","offset":2427},{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"canals","offset":2467},{"uri":"Levee","surface_form":"levees","offset":2478},{"uri":"Vulnerable_species","surface_form":"vulnerable","offset":2647},{"uri":"Ampullariidae","surface_form":"apple snails","offset":2740}]}
