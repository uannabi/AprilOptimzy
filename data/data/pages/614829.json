By that time, with demographic changes, 98% of residents were black.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":91},{"uri":"Belt_Railway_of_Chicago","surface_form":"Belt Railway of Chicago","offset":300},{"uri":"Englewood%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Englewood","offset":456}]}
