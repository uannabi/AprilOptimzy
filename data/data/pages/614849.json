It travels from the neighborhood of West Loop to O'Hare International Airport. The highway is named for the 35th U.S. President, John F. Kennedy.\nThe Interstate 90 (I-90) portion of the Kennedy is a part of the much longer I-90 (which runs from Boston, Massachusetts to Seattle, Washington). The Kennedy's official endpoints are the Circle Interchange with Interstate 290 (Eisenhower Expressway/Congress Parkway) and the Dan Ryan Expressway (also I-90/94) at the east end, and the O'Hare Airport terminals at the west end.\nWith up to 327,000 vehicles traveling on some portions of the Kennedy daily, the Kennedy and its South Side extension, the Dan Ryan, are the busiest roads in Illinois.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
