{"id":614852,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly%2C_Chicago","text":"e=\"preserve\">Beverly is one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, Illinois. It is located on the South Side on the southwestern edge of the city.\nSparsely settled in the middle of the 19th century. Its position on the ridge allowed the community to become an exclusive streetcar suburb, and the homes and large lots reflect this historic distinction. Beverly is located on the highest elevation in Chicago.\nThe neighborhood's roots are largely English and Protestant but is now home to a large Irish-American/Catholic community and many Irish establishments.\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Beverly cast 6,384 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,850 votes Donald Trump.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":57},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":66},{"uri":"South_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"South Side","offset":97},{"uri":"Streetcar_suburb","surface_form":"streetcar suburb","offset":269},{"uri":"Irish_American","surface_form":"Irish-American","offset":494},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":537},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016 presidential election","offset":566},{"uri":"Hillary_Clinton","surface_form":"Hillary Clinton","offset":623},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":660}]}
