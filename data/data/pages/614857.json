{"id":614857,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungalow","text":"A bungalow is a type of building, originally developed in the Bengal region in South Asia, but now found throughout the world. The meaning of the word \"bungalow\" varies internationally. Common features of many bungalows include verandas and being low-rise.\nIn Australia, the California bungalow associated with the United States was popular after the First World War.\nIn North America and the United Kingdom, a bungalow today is a house, normally detached, that may contain a small loft, many seen in Chicago and in Houston. It is either single-story or has a second story built into a sloping roof, usually with dormer windows (one-and-a-half stories).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bengal","surface_form":"Bengal","offset":62},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":79},{"uri":"Veranda","surface_form":"veranda","offset":228},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":260},{"uri":"California_bungalow","surface_form":"California bungalow","offset":275},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"First World War","offset":351},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":371},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":393},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":501},{"uri":"Houston","surface_form":"Houston","offset":516},{"uri":"Dormer_window","surface_form":"dormer window","offset":613}]}
