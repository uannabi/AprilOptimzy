{"id":614883,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman%2C_Chicago","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pullman, one of Chicago's 77 defined community areas. It is a neighborhood located on the city's South Side. Twelve miles from the Chicago Loop. It is named after Chicago industrialist George Pullman.\nSince the late 20th century, the Pullman neighborhood has been gentrifying. Many residents are involved in the restoration of their own homes, and projects throughout the district as a whole. Walking tours of Pullman are available.\nPullman has many historic and architecturally significant buildings; among these are the Hotel Florence; the Arcade Building, which was destroyed in the 1920s. The area is home to churches in Chicago built in Polish Cathedral style, the former church of St. Salomea. It is now used by Salem Baptist Church of Chicago.\nIn a contest sponsored by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, Pullman was one of seven sites nominated for the Illinois Seven Wonders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago's","offset":29},{"uri":"South_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"South Side","offset":110},{"uri":"Chicago_Loop","surface_form":"Chicago Loop","offset":144},{"uri":"George_Pullman","surface_form":"George Pullman","offset":198},{"uri":"Gentrification","surface_form":"gentrify","offset":277},{"uri":"Hotel_Florence","surface_form":"Hotel Florence","offset":535},{"uri":"Polish_Cathedral_style","surface_form":"Polish Cathedral style","offset":655},{"uri":"Baptist","surface_form":"Baptist","offset":737}]}
