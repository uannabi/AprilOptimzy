It is part of the 10th Ward, once under the control of former Richard J. Daley ally Alderman Edward Vrdolyak.\nIt is an industrial neighborhood, a small group of homes exists in the northeast corner and Lake Calumet takes up a large portion of the area. 80% of the community is zoned as industrial, natural wetlands, or parks. The remaining 20% is zoned for residential and small-scale commercial uses.\nLouis Rosen documented the racial transition of this and nearby communities in his 1998 book \"The South Side: The Racial Transformation of an American Neighborhood\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":39},{"uri":"South_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"South Side","offset":53},{"uri":"Richard_J._Daley","surface_form":"Richard J.
