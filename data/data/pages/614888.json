{"id":614888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tylenol_murders","text":"The Chicago Tylenol murders were a series of poisoning deaths resulting from drug tampering in the Chicago metropolitan area in 1982. The victims had all taken Tylenol-branded acetaminophen capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide. A total of seven people died in the original poisonings, with several more deaths in subsequent copycat crimes.\nEffects.\nThese incidents led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter medications and to federal anti-tampering laws. The actions of Johnson & Johnson to reduce deaths and warn the public of poisoning risks have been widely praised as an exemplary public relations response to such a crisis.\nNo suspect was ever charged or convicted of the poisonings. New York City resident James William Lewis, who was considered the prime suspect, was convicted only of extortion for sending a letter to Johnson & Johnson that took credit for the deaths and demanded $1 million to stop them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago metropolitan area","offset":99},{"uri":"Tylenol","surface_form":"Tylenol-branded","offset":160},{"uri":"Acetaminophen","surface_form":"acetaminophen","offset":176},{"uri":"Cyanide","surface_form":"potassium cyanide","offset":224},{"uri":"Copycat_crime","surface_form":"copycat crime","offset":339},{"uri":"Over-the-counter_drug","surface_form":"over-the-counter medication","offset":415},{"uri":"Johnson_%26amp%3B_Johnson","surface_form":"Johnson & Johnson","offset":495},{"uri":"Extortion","surface_form":"extortion","offset":818}]}
