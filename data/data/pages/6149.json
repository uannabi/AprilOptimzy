There are also some plants that eat insects. One plant that is an insectivore is called a Venus fly-trap.\nTo eat insects for food is not very easy because it takes many insects to make enough food for a large insect-eating animal. Anteaters eat hundreds of ants every day.\nSome omnivores like humans and bears also eat insects for food.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":21},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":31},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":67},{"uri":"Anteater","surface_form":"Anteater","offset":76},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ant","offset":108},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":134},{"uri":"Venus_fly-trap","surface_form":"Venus fly-trap","offset":204},{"uri":"Omnivore","surface_form":"omnivore","offset":392},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":407},{"uri":"Bear","surface_form":"bear","offset":418}]}
