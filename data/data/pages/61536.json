{"id":61536,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Edziza","text":"Mount Edziza is a dormant volcano in British Columbia, Canada.\nThe volcano is 38 km southeast of Telegraph Creek in an area of potentially active volcanos in the Stikine Volcanic Belt. It is a shield volcano that began erupting about 10 million years ago with continued activity until about 1,340 years ago.\nEdziza is made up of a lot of cinder cones and blocky lava flows that still keep their first forms. This is the second biggest area of volcanic activity in the northern Stikine Volcanic Belt as well as in Canada. The complex includes the Mount Edziza Plateau, a big volcanic plateau (65 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide) made of mostly basaltic lava flows with four big stratovolcanoes built on top of the plateau.\nA lot of eruptions have happened in the last 10,000 years including: Desolation, Mess Lake, Snowshoe lava fields, Kana Cone, Eve Cone, Cinder Cliff, Icefall Cone, Ridge Cone, Williams Cone, and Walkout Creek. Many of the volcanic features in the volcanic complex are protected as part of Mount Edziza Provincal Park one of the bigger provincial parks in British Columbia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dormant_volcano","surface_form":"dormant volcano","offset":18},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":37},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":55},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":67},{"uri":"Km","surface_form":"km","offset":81},{"uri":"Telegraph_Creek","surface_form":"Telegraph Creek","offset":97},{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active volcano","offset":139},{"uri":"Stikine_Volcanic_Belt","surface_form":"Stikine Volcanic Belt","offset":162},{"uri":"Shield_volcano","surface_form":"shield volcano","offset":193},{"uri":"Erupt","surface_form":"erupt","offset":219},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":245},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":297},{"uri":"Cinder_cone","surface_form":"cinder cone","offset":338},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":362},{"uri":"Stikine_Volcanic_Belt","surface_form":"Stikine Volcanic Belt","offset":477},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":513},{"uri":"Mount_Edziza_Plateau","surface_form":"Mount Edziza Plateau","offset":546},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":574},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":583},{"uri":"Kilometer","surface_form":"kilometer","offset":595},{"uri":"Kilometer","surface_form":"kilometer","offset":618},{"uri":"Basalt","surface_form":"basalt","offset":650},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":659},{"uri":"Stratovolcano","surface_form":"stratovolcano","offset":684},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":720},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"eruptions","offset":738},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":781},{"uri":"Desolation_Lava_Field","surface_form":"Desolation","offset":798},{"uri":"Mess_Lake","surface_form":"Mess Lake","offset":810},{"uri":"Snowshoe_lava_fields","surface_form":"Snowshoe lava fields","offset":821},{"uri":"Kana_Cone","surface_form":"Kana Cone","offset":843},{"uri":"Eve_Cone","surface_form":"Eve Cone","offset":854},{"uri":"Cinder_Cliff","surface_form":"Cinder Cliff","offset":864},{"uri":"Icefall_Cone","surface_form":"Icefall Cone","offset":878},{"uri":"Ridge_Cone","surface_form":"Ridge Cone","offset":892},{"uri":"Williams_Cone","surface_form":"Williams Cone","offset":904},{"uri":"Walkout_Creek","surface_form":"Walkout Creek","offset":923},{"uri":"Mount_Edziza_Provincal_Park","surface_form":"Mount Edziza Provincal Park","offset":1017},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"provincial","offset":1063},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":1083}]}
