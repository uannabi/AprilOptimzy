{"id":61541,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Robson","text":"Sir Robert William \"Bobby\" Robson (18 February 1933 \u2013 31 July 2009) was an English association footballer and manager. He played almost 600 matches and scored over 100 goals. He also played for the England national team. He scored four goals in 20 games for them.\nRobson managed Fulham F.C. and Ipswich Town F.C.. He then managed the England national football team for eight years, from 1982 to 1990. He led England to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 1990. He left England to manage other football teams in Europe. These included clubs from Holland, Portugal and Spain. Robson came back to England to manage Newcastle United F.C. in 1999.\nRobson was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was described as terminal in 2007. He died in 2009.\nEarly life.\nRobson was born in Sacriston, County Durham, England in 1933. He was the fourth of five brothers. As a young child he often went to St James' Park with his father to watch Newcastle United F.C.\nWhen he was only 15, Robson played football in a local team of boys aged 18. He became an apprentice electrician but still played football. In 1950, the Fulham F.C. manager, Bill Dodgin, Sr., visited Robson's home. He offered Robson a contract to play professional football. Robson signed the contract and moved to London.\nClub football.\nRobson played in his first professional football game for Fulham F.C. in 1950. He spent six years at the club before moving to West Bromwich Albion for \u00A325,000. He played for Albion for six years. During that time, he played in nearly 250 games, scoring over 50 goals. Albion said no when Robson asked for a bigger salary, and he moved back to Fulham. Fulham sold some important players after Robson came back to the team. This led Robson to think he would not win any trophies. He left Fulham in 1967 and joined the Vancouver Royals in Canada as both a player and a manager. However, he had to share the management role with someone else. Robson did not like this and moved back to England in 1968. He started to manage Fulham.\nInternational football.\nRobson was selected for England while at West Bromwich Albion. He played for England in the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was selected for the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Due to injury in a friendly against Chile, Robson had to leave from the squad. In total, he played 20 times for his country.\nEarly club management.\nRobson started his career as a manager at Fulham F.C. The team were relegated in his first season there. Robson was sacked the following season. In 1969 he became manager of Ipswich Town F.C. However he won no major competitions or trophies during his first four years in charge. In 1973 Ipswich won the Texaco Cup.\nOver the next nine seasons in the First Division, only once did Ispwich finish lower than the sixth place. This was the 1977\u201378 season however the club then went on to win the FA Cup, beating Arsenal F.C. 1\u20130 at Wembley. Three years later, Robson led Ipswich to victory in the UEFA Cup. The club beat Dutch team AZ Alkmaar 5\u20134 over two games. Robson moved on to manage the England national football team in 1982.\nEngland national team.\nRobson managed the England team 95 times, with 47 victories. In the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, he led the team to the quarter-finals where they lost to Argentina 2\u20131. Both Argentina goals were scored by Diego Maradona, including the famous \"Hand of God\" goal. Four years later, in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Robson led England into the semi-finals. This time they lost to West Germany in a penalty shoot-out. After this World Cup, Robson's contract was not extended by the Football Association.\nEuropean club management.\nRobson joined Dutch club P.S.V. Eindhoven in 1990. They won the league in his first two seasons. However, they did not win any European competitions and in 1992 Robson lost his job. Robson joined Portuguese club Sporting Clube de Portugal in July 1992. He led them to third place in the league in his first season. Defeat in Europe meant Robson lost his job again, in December 1994. He was quickly offered the manager's job by F.C. Porto. He led the team to victory in the Portuguese Cup and they won the league for two seasons in a row.\nIn the summer of 1996, Robson became manager at FC Barcelona. In his short time at the club, he signed Ronaldo and led the club to win the Spanish Cup, Spanish Super Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup. The next season Robson took a more administrative position before going back to Holland to manage P.S.V. Eindhoven for one season.\nThe next year, Robson went back to England to work for the Football Association. Soon after his return, Newcastle United F.C. manager Ruud Gullit left, and Robson took the manager's job at St James' Park. He managed the club until 2004 without winning any major trophies or competitions.\nInternational consultant.\nOn 13 January 2006, Steve Staunton was selected as manager of the Republic of Ireland national team.

Because of health problems, Robson left this position on 17 November 2007.\nLife outside football.\nRobson was married to his wife Elsie from 1955 until his death. They had three sons: Andrew, Paul and Mark.\nHealth.\nIn 1991, Robson was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, from which he recovered the following year. His ill health affected his work. While at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma. This meant he missed the first months of the 1995\u201396 season. He had many operations, including one in 2006 for a brain tumour.\nOn 17 October 2006, Robson was given the all-clear. He was set to complete his contract as consultant to the Irish team.
