{"id":615547,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Misandry means hating men. It is a type of misanthropy but against males. A misandrist is a person who hates men or boys. They may hate men because they believe there is something wrong with them, such as being stupid, dirty or evil.\nMisandry is different from sexism, which is not based on hate. Radical feminists are sometimes viewed as misandric. Misandry includes violence or discrimination against men. Some misandrists are prejudiced against men. For example they may think that all men or boys are potential rapists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hate","surface_form":"hating","offset":28},{"uri":"Men","surface_form":"men","offset":35},{"uri":"Misanthropy","surface_form":"misanthropy","offset":56},{"uri":"Sexism","surface_form":"sexism","offset":274}]}
