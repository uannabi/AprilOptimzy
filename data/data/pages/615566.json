{"id":615566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_crime","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gender differences in crime are differences between females and males as criminals or as the victims of crime. Studies of this subject may be in the areas of criminology (study of criminal behavior), sociobiology and women's studies.\nAccording to statistics, males commit more crimes than females. But females do sometimes commit crimes matching those of men, such as bank robbery, murder and burglary.\nA 2008 study of domestic violence shows that women have different reasons from men when committing violence against their partner. Women are more likely to do this because they are afraid or to defend themselves. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to be trying to be in control. Men are more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partner. Women were more likely to slap, kick, bite, throw something at their partner, punch their partners or hit with objects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Female","surface_form":"female","offset":65},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":77},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":117},{"uri":"Criminology","surface_form":"criminology","offset":171},{"uri":"Sociobiology","surface_form":"sociobiology","offset":213},{"uri":"Women%27s_studies","surface_form":"women's studies","offset":230},{"uri":"Bank_robbery","surface_form":"bank robbery","offset":381},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":395},{"uri":"Burglary","surface_form":"burglary","offset":406},{"uri":"Domestic_violence","surface_form":"domestic violence","offset":432},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":515}]}
