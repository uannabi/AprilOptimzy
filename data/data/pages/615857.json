He was born in Moscow. Minlos was known for his works to probability theory and mathematical physics. His theorem on the extension of cylindrical measures to Radon measures on the continuous dual of a nuclear space is of fundamental importance in the theory of generalized random processes.\nMinlos died on 9 January 2018 in Moscow at the age of 86.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"USSR","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":83},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":94},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":102},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":132},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":174},{"uri":"Mathematical_physics","surface_form":"mathematical physics","offset":197},{"uri":"Minlos%27s_theorem","surface_form":"His theorem","offset":219},{"uri":"Cylindrical_measure","surface_form":"cylindrical measure","offset":251},{"uri":"Radon_measure","surface_form":"Radon measure","offset":275},{"uri":"Dual_space","surface_form":"continuous dual","offset":297},{"uri":"Nuclear_space","surface_form":"nuclear space","offset":318},{"uri":"Generalized_random_process","surface_form":"generalized random process","offset":378}]}
