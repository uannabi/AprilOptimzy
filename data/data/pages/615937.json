It truly captures the free-spirited love and chemistry between the protagonists - Abir and Shaluk. Life takes a turn when introvert city-bred boy 'Abir' meets the vivacious village girl 'Shaluk'. Their unusual friendship clicks in an instant and soon a sweet innocent chemistry develops between the two. Soon they realize their feelings towards each other. Thus, starts the story of their 'first love'. 'Eii Chhele Ta Bhelbhele Ta' is a tale of love, which follows the protagonists through myriad of situations and sees them unite against all odds. The story showcases a pure love story between two teenagers and how their love matures over time and rises above the different obstacles of life.\nThe show however has a lot of exist undertones too. The lead female character Shaluk is characterized as an all virtuous young lady without any faults.The writers and producers of the show, portray female lead characters idealistically instead of celebrating their faults as part of normal human nature. The supporting characters on the other hand are extremely blatant and malleable. They never show any strong or original viewpoints, as if the only reason for their casting is to complete a joint Bengali family. The male lead Abir is a polygamist and also narcissistic. He is a postgraduate student in Physics(it remains to be seen how that is possible because he is really stupid); without any source of income while staying in his parents house and without even trying is able to seduce two women to marry him. This is either because the women married him for the family heirloom or testimony to the dystopian mindset of the writers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bengali_Language","surface_form":"Bengali","offset":44},{"uri":"Soap_Opera","surface_form":"Soap Opera","offset":63},{"uri":"Zee_Bangla","surface_form":"Zee Bangla","offset":120},{"uri":"Magic_Moments_Motion_Pictures","surface_form":"Magic Moments Motion Pictures","offset":144},{"uri":"Prapti_Chatterjee","surface_form":"Prapti Chatterjee","offset":186},{"uri":"Somraj_Maity","surface_form":"Somraj Maity","offset":208},{"uri":"Nabanita_Malakar","surface_form":"Nabanita Malakar","offset":236},{"uri":"Sabitri_Chatterjee","surface_form":"Sabitri Chatterjee","offset":276},{"uri":"Anusuya_Majumdar","surface_form":"Anusuya Majumdar","offset":296},{"uri":"Shankar_Chakraborty","surface_form":"Shankar Chakraborty","offset":314},{"uri":"Bharat_Kaul","surface_form":"Bharat Kaul","offset":338},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"Mythology","offset":398},{"uri":"Karunamoyee_Rani_Rashmoni","surface_form":"Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni","offset":413}]}
