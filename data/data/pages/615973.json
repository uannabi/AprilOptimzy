Cato Street was their meeting-place, near Edgware Road in London.\nThe police had an informer. The plotters fell into a police trap. 13 were arrested, and one policeman was killed. Five conspirators were executed, and five others were transported to Australia.\nHow widespread the Cato Street conspiracy was is uncertain. It was a time of unrest; rumours abounded. Chase notes that, \"the London-Irish community and a number of trade societies, notably shoemakers, were prepared to lend support, while unrest and awareness of a planned rising were widespread in the industrial north and on Clydeside\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":60},{"uri":"Cabinet_minister","surface_form":"cabinet minister","offset":68},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":90},{"uri":"Robert_Jenkinson%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Liverpool","surface_form":"Lord Liverpool","offset":105},{"uri":"Edgware_Road","surface_form":"Edgware Road","offset":171},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":187},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrest","offset":269},{"uri":"Executed","surface_form":"executed","offset":332},{"uri":"Penal_transportation","surface_form":"transported to Australia","offset":363}]}
