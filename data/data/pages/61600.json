{"id":61600,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomyoidea","text":"Geomyoidea is a superfamily of rodents that contains the pocket gophers (Geomyidae), the kangaroo rats and mice (Heteromyidae), and their fossil relatives.\nCharacteristics.\nAlthough they do not look similar, gophers are joined with kangaroo rats into a common superfamily. This is widely agreed. Overall morphology, the fossil record, sequence analysis, and biogeography all support this relationship.\nModern geomyoids are mostly restricted to North America, but some have extended their range into South America since the Great American Interchange. Fossil taxa are known from throughout Laurasia.\nRelation to other rodents.\nSome authorities consider the geomyoids related to squirrels, beavers, and mountain beavers.\nOther authorities consider geomyoids may be related to mice, jerboas, and perhaps dormice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":31},{"uri":"Pocket_gopher","surface_form":"pocket gopher","offset":57},{"uri":"Geomyidae","surface_form":"Geomyidae","offset":73},{"uri":"Kangaroo_rat","surface_form":"kangaroo rat","offset":89},{"uri":"Heteromyidae","surface_form":"Heteromyidae","offset":113},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":138},{"uri":"Morphology_(biology)","surface_form":"morphology","offset":304},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"sequence analysis","offset":335},{"uri":"Biogeography","surface_form":"biogeography","offset":358},{"uri":"Great_American_Interchange","surface_form":"Great American Interchange","offset":523},{"uri":"Laurasia","surface_form":"Laurasia","offset":589},{"uri":"Squirrel","surface_form":"squirrel","offset":677},{"uri":"Beaver","surface_form":"beaver","offset":688},{"uri":"Mountain_beaver","surface_form":"mountain beaver","offset":701},{"uri":"Muroidea","surface_form":"mice","offset":774},{"uri":"Jerboa","surface_form":"jerboa","offset":780},{"uri":"Dormouse","surface_form":"dormice","offset":801}]}
