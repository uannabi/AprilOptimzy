{"id":61601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteromyidae","text":"The family of rodents that include kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice and rock pocket mice is the Heteromyidae family. Most heteromyids live in complex burrows in the deserts and grasslands of western North America. Some species within the \"Heteromys\" and \"Liomys\" genera are also found in forests and can be found down as far as northern South America. They feed mostly on seeds and other plant parts, which they carry in their cheek pouches to their burrows.\nAlthough they are very different in physical appearance, the closest relatives of the heteromyids are pocket gophers in the Geomyidae family.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":14},{"uri":"Kangaroo_rat","surface_form":"kangaroo rat","offset":35},{"uri":"Kangaroo_mouse","surface_form":"kangaroo mice","offset":50},{"uri":"Pocket_mouse","surface_form":"rock pocket mice","offset":68},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":161},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":173},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":195},{"uri":"Heteromys","surface_form":"Heteromys","offset":235},{"uri":"Liomys","surface_form":"Liomys","offset":251},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":259},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":284},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":333},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":368},{"uri":"Pocket_gopher","surface_form":"pocket gopher","offset":557}]}
