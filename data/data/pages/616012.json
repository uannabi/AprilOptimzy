{"id":616012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hawaii_false_missile_alert","text":"On January 13, 2018, a false ballistic missile alert was issued by the Emergency Alert System and Commercial Mobile Alert System over television, radio, and cellphones in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The alert said that there was an incoming ballistic missile threat to Hawaii, advised residents to seek shelter, and said \"this is not a drill\".\nThe message was sent at 8:07 a.m. HST. 38 minutes later a second message was sent describing the first as a \"false alarm\". State officials later blamed a button pushed in error during a shift change at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency for the false first message.\nGovernor David Ige publicly said he was sorry for the false alert. The United States Federal Communications Commission and the Hawaii House of Representatives announced investigations into the incident.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ballistic_missile","surface_form":"ballistic missile","offset":29},{"uri":"Emergency_Alert_System","surface_form":"Emergency Alert System","offset":71},{"uri":"Commercial_Mobile_Alert_System","surface_form":"Commercial Mobile Alert System","offset":98},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":175},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":189},{"uri":"Hawaii%E2%80%93Aleutian_Time_Zone","surface_form":"HST","offset":376},{"uri":"Hawaii_Emergency_Management_Agency","surface_form":"Hawaii Emergency Management Agency","offset":548},{"uri":"David_Ige","surface_form":"David Ige","offset":621},{"uri":"FCC","surface_form":"United States Federal Communications Commission","offset":683},{"uri":"Hawaii_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Hawaii House of Representatives","offset":739}]}
