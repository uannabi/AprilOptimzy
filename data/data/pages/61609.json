{"id":61609,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaetodipus","text":"\"Chaetodipus\" is a genus of pocket mouse. Like other members of their family such as pocket mice in the genus \"Perognathus\", they are more closely related to pocket gophers than to true mice.\nCharacteristics.\nMembers of this genus range in size from 80\u2013125\u00A0mm (head and body) and weigh 15-47 grams (Nowak, 1999). Unlike the silky pocket mice (genus \"Perognathus\"), most species of the genus \"Chaetodipus\" have harsh pelage with some bordering on spiny hair. They tend to be found in arid habitats where they feed on seeds, vegetation, and insects (Nowak, 1999). Females give birth to a litter of 2-9 young after a gestation period of just under a month. The longest recorded lifespan is 8 years and 4 months (Nowak, 1999).\nSometimes members of the genus \"Chaetodipus\" are placed in the genus \"Perognathus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heteromyidae","surface_form":"their family","offset":64},{"uri":"Perognathus","surface_form":"Perognathus","offset":111},{"uri":"Pocket_gopher","surface_form":"pocket gopher","offset":158},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":186},{"uri":"Perognathus","surface_form":"Perognathus","offset":350},{"uri":"Gestation_period","surface_form":"gestation period","offset":614},{"uri":"Lifespan","surface_form":"lifespan","offset":675},{"uri":"Perognathus","surface_form":"Perognathus","offset":793}]}
