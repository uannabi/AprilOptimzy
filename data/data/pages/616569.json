Soyrabai bore two children to Shivaji, a daughter Balibai and son Rajaram.\nAfter Shivaji's death.\nAfter Shivaji's death in 1680, with the help of some of the courtiers, Soyarabai got her ten-year-old son, Rajaram, on the vacant throne. Her stepson and heir presumptive Sambhaji, was able to thwart this with the help of Soyrabai's own brother,and army chief Hambirrao Mohite. He imprisoned Soyarabai and Rajaram and formally assumed power as the Chhatrapati on July 20, 1680.\nAfter Sambhaji seized power from Soyrabai, she tried every means to dethrone him. Soyarabai's henchmen tried to poison Sambhaji in August 1681, but he survived. When he learnt about the plot, he had Soyarabai poisoned to death. Many plotters including Soyarabai's relatives of the Mohite family were also slaughtered or trampled by the elephants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["royalty"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shivaji","surface_form":"Shivaji","offset":67},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":118},{"uri":"Rajaram_Chhatrapati","surface_form":"Rajaram Chhatrapati","offset":165},{"uri":"Hambirrao_Mohite","surface_form":"Hambirrao Mohite","offset":235},{"uri":"Shahaji","surface_form":"Shahaji","offset":400},{"uri":"Bangalore","surface_form":"Bangalore","offset":411},{"uri":"Jijabai","surface_form":"Jijabai","offset":437},{"uri":"Jijabai","surface_form":"Jijabai","offset":569},{"uri":"Rajaram_Chhatrapati","surface_form":"Rajaram","offset":890},{"uri":"Heir_presumptive","surface_form":"heir presumptive","offset":937},{"uri":"Sambhaji","surface_form":"Sambhaji","offset":954},{"uri":"Hambirrao_Mohite","surface_form":"Hambirrao Mohite","offset":1043}]}
