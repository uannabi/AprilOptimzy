{"id":61669,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarana","text":"Guarana or Guaran\u00E1 (, or), \"Paullinia cupana\" (syn. \"P. crysan, P. sorbilis\"), is a shrub or small tree in the Sapindaceae family. It is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil. The seed of the Guaran\u00E1 fruit is a stimulant with thermogenic and diuretic properties.\nThe guaran\u00E1 fruit's color ranges from orange to red and contain black seeds which are partly covered by white arils. The color contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs; this has formed the basis of a myth \"(see below)\".\nGuaran\u00E1 plays an important role in Tupi and Guaran\u00ED Brazilian culture. The name 'guaran\u00E1' is derived from the Tupi-Guarani word \"wara'n\u00E1\". These tribes believed, it was magical, a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength. They also tell the myth of a 'Divine Child' that was killed by a serpent and whose eyes gave birth to this plant.\nUses.\nGuaran\u00E1 is mainly used as an ingredient in soft drinks and energy drinks. It is also used as a dietary supplement, generally to promote weight loss. In addition, it may be an ingredient in other foods.\nBeverages.\nIn addition to other chemicals, the guaran\u00E1 plant contains caffeine (sometimes called \"guaranine\"), theophylline, and theobromine. Water extracts of the guarana plant are central nervous system stimulants due to the content of these alkaloids. Energy drink manufacturers typically add synthetic caffeine or caffeine derived from coffee decaffeination, though many advertise \"natural\" caffeine from the seeds of guaran\u00E1.\nBrazil produces several brands of soft drink from guaran\u00E1 extract that contain no added caffeine. Each differs greatly in flavour; some have only a slight guaran\u00E1 fruit taste. They are typically fizzy and sweet, with a very fruity aftertaste. Most guaran\u00E1 drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries, such as Paraguay. Major brands include Guaran\u00E1 Antarctica, Guaran\u00E1 Schin from Schincariol and Guaran\u00E1 Brahma from AmBev, Kuat, and Guaran\u00E1 Jesus, a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it. Many local producers also create drinks not for export.\nUsing it to lose weight.\nStudies involving guaran\u00E1 show benefits to cognitive function. They have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any similar government agencies. In the United States, guaran\u00E1 holds a GRAS-status, i.e. \"generally regarded as safe\" and must be labeled as \"not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\"\nThe Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a study in June 2001. This study shows an average 11.2\u00A0pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guaran\u00E1 and damiana, compared to an average 1\u00A0pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days.\nA university study in Brazil of guaran\u00E1 extract showed a platelet aggregation decrease of up to 37% of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid of up to 78% of control values. This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs, an arterial blood clot can develop, resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke.\nA separate 1997 study of guaran\u00E1's effects on the physical activity of rats showed increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo.\nOther studies have shown antioxidant, antibacterial, and fat cell reduction (when combined with conjugated linoleic acid) properties in guaran\u00E1\nAlthough side-effects of guaran\u00E1 are rare, drugs.com recommends, \"When considering the use of herbal supplements, consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable. Additionally, consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbal/health supplements may be beneficial, and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous\". Drugs.com also advises not to mix guaran\u00E1 with ephedrine.\nWhat guarana is made of.\nGuaran\u00E1 seeds consist of mostly reddish vegetable fiber and resin with a small amount of oil and water. Guarana contains different amounts of caffeine, theobromine, theophylline and other alkaloids, compared to coffee, tea, mate, or cocoa.\nDuke1992a: Duke, James A. 1992. \"Handbook of phytochemical constituents of GRAS herbs and other economic plants.\" Boca Raton, FL. CRC Press.\nGuaranine and caffeine.\nThe chemical \"guaranine\" is identical to caffeine coming from other sources, for example coffee, tea and mate. Guaranine, theine, mateine are all official synonyms for caffeine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Synonymy","surface_form":"syn.","offset":47},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":84},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":99},{"uri":"Sapindaceae","surface_form":"Sapindaceae","offset":111},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":147},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":170},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":182},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":202},{"uri":"Stimulant","surface_form":"stimulant","offset":213},{"uri":"Thermogenics","surface_form":"thermogenic","offset":228},{"uri":"Diuretic","surface_form":"diuretic","offset":244},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":335},{"uri":"Aril","surface_form":"aril","offset":375},{"uri":"Tup%C3%AD_people","surface_form":"Tupi","offset":552},{"uri":"Guaran%C3%AD","surface_form":"Guaran\u00ED","offset":561},{"uri":"Tupi-Guarani","surface_form":"Tupi-Guarani","offset":627},{"uri":"Tribe","surface_form":"tribe","offset":662},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":686},{"uri":"Serpent","surface_form":"serpent","offset":818},{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soft drink","offset":916},{"uri":"Energy_drink","surface_form":"energy drink","offset":932},{"uri":"Dietary_supplement","surface_form":"dietary supplement","offset":968},{"uri":"Caffeine","surface_form":"caffeine","offset":1145},{"uri":"Theophylline","surface_form":"theophylline","offset":1186},{"uri":"Theobromine","surface_form":"theobromine","offset":1204},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":1257},{"uri":"Stimulant","surface_form":"stimulant","offset":1280},{"uri":"Alkaloids","surface_form":"alkaloids","offset":1319},{"uri":"Chemical_synthesis","surface_form":"synthetic","offset":1371},{"uri":"Decaffeination","surface_form":"decaffeination","offset":1422},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1506},{"uri":"Aftertaste","surface_form":"aftertaste","offset":1737},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":1845},{"uri":"Guaran%C3%A1_Antarctica","surface_form":"Guaran\u00E1 Antarctica","offset":1876},{"uri":"Schincariol","surface_form":"Schincariol","offset":1915},{"uri":"AmBev","surface_form":"AmBev","offset":1951},{"uri":"Kuat","surface_form":"Kuat","offset":1958},{"uri":"Guaran%C3%A1_Jesus","surface_form":"Guaran\u00E1 Jesus","offset":1968},{"uri":"Food_and_Drug_Administration","surface_form":"Food and Drug Administration","offset":2230},{"uri":"FDA","surface_form":"FDA","offset":2260},{"uri":"Journal_of_Human_Nutrition_and_Dietetics","surface_form":"Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics","offset":2477},{"uri":"June","surface_form":"June","offset":2539},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":2544},{"uri":"Yerba_mate","surface_form":"yerba mate","offset":2632},{"uri":"Damiana","surface_form":"damiana","offset":2656},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":2737},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":2757},{"uri":"Platelet","surface_form":"platelet","offset":2792},{"uri":"Arachidonic_acid","surface_form":"arachidonic acid","offset":2907},{"uri":"Antioxidant","surface_form":"antioxidant","offset":3350},{"uri":"Antibacterial","surface_form":"antibacterial","offset":3363},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":3382},{"uri":"Conjugated_linoleic_acid","surface_form":"conjugated linoleic acid","offset":3421},{"uri":"Ephedrine","surface_form":"ephedrine","offset":3905},{"uri":"Vegetable_fiber","surface_form":"vegetable fiber","offset":3981},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":4001},{"uri":"Caffeine","surface_form":"caffeine","offset":4083},{"uri":"Theobromine","surface_form":"theobromine","offset":4093},{"uri":"Theophylline","surface_form":"theophylline","offset":4106},{"uri":"Yerba_mate","surface_form":"mate","offset":4165},{"uri":"Cocoa","surface_form":"cocoa","offset":4174},{"uri":"Caffeine","surface_form":"caffeine","offset":4387},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":4435},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":4443},{"uri":"Yerba_mate","surface_form":"mate","offset":4451}]}
