{"id":616830,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right","text":"e=\"preserve\">The alt-right is a right-wing political movement originating in the United States. There are many different type of people in the alt-right. They include white nationalists, antifeminists, manospherians, conservatives, Christians, nationalists and men's rights activists. The group is said to have influenced the 2016 United States presidential election in favor of the winning candidate Donald Trump. The term \"Alt-right\" is said to have been coined by Richard B. Spencer, who is a political writer and the current president of the nationalist think-tank National Policy Institute.\nThe alt-right originated on 4chan and other fringe corners of the Internet, such as Reddit, Know Your Meme and Encyclopedia Dramatica. It emerged during the aftermath of the 2012 episode about Fobos-Grunt on the English Wikipedia and Gamergate in 2014.\nAs the years pass since Trump's victory in 2016, the alt-right began to splinter, and its split accelerated following the 2017 Charlottesville incident, with those on the Internet saying they don't like Trump anymore.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":32},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":81},{"uri":"White_nationalist","surface_form":"white nationalist","offset":167},{"uri":"Antifeminist","surface_form":"antifeminist","offset":187},{"uri":"Manospherian","surface_form":"manospherian","offset":202},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservative","offset":217},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christians","offset":232},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalists","offset":244},{"uri":"Men%27s_rights_movement","surface_form":"men's rights","offset":261},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016 United States presidential election","offset":326},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":401},{"uri":"Richard_B._Spencer","surface_form":"Richard B.
