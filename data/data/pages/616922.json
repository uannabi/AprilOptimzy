{"id":616922,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Daley_Park","text":"Maggie Daley Park is a public park in the Loop community area of Chicago. It is near the Lake Michigan shoreline in northeastern Grant Park.\nMaggie Daley Park is connected to Millennium Park by the BP Pedestrian Bridge. It is named for Maggie Daley, the former first lady of the city who died of breast cancer in 2011.\nThe park was almost entirely remade with multiple new features including a new field house, an ice skating ribbon, climbing walls, landscaping and children's playground. A garden honors cancer survivors.\nIt is bounded by Randolph Street, Monroe, Columbus and Lake Shore Drives. Construction took 2 years and cost $60 million, including rebuilding an underground parking lot.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Park","surface_form":"park","offset":30},{"uri":"Chicago_Loop","surface_form":"Loop","offset":42},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":65},{"uri":"Lake_Michigan","surface_form":"Lake Michigan","offset":89},{"uri":"Grant_Park","surface_form":"Grant Park","offset":129},{"uri":"Millennium_Park","surface_form":"Millennium Park","offset":175},{"uri":"BP_Pedestrian_Bridge","surface_form":"BP Pedestrian Bridge","offset":198},{"uri":"Maggie_Daley","surface_form":"Maggie Daley","offset":236},{"uri":"Breast_cancer","surface_form":"breast cancer","offset":296},{"uri":"Climbing_wall","surface_form":"climbing wall","offset":434},{"uri":"Cancer_survivors","surface_form":"cancer survivors","offset":505},{"uri":"Randolph_Street","surface_form":"Randolph Street","offset":540},{"uri":"Columbus_Drive_(Chicago)","surface_form":"Columbus","offset":565},{"uri":"Lake_Shore_Drive","surface_form":"Lake Shore Drive","offset":578}]}
