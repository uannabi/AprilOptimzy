{"id":617184,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyovenator","text":"\"Ichthyovenator\" was a meat-eating theropod dinosaur. It was from the Early Cretaceous, about 113 to 125 million years ago. Its fossils were found in Laos in 2010. \"Ichthyovenator\" was a spinosaurid, they were crocodile-like dinosaurs that ate fish.\nIt is one of three spinosaurids found in Asia, the other two are Siamosaurus, and \"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis.\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe first parts of the skeleton were found in 2010. They include: One rib, part of the animal's backbones (or vertebra), and most hip bones. They did not find the skull.\nThe only known species is \"Ichthyovenator laosensis.\" It was named and described by Ronan Allain and his colleagues in 2012. It was found in the Gr\u00E8s sup\u00E9rieurs Formation.\nThe name \"Ichthyovenator\" comes from the Greek word for \"fish\" and the Latin word for \"hunter\", The name refers to the fact that it ate fish. The species name is \"laosensis\", because it lived in what is now Laos.\nWhile \"Ichthyovenator\" was being described, paleontologists were still digging up more of its bones.\nRonan Allain was one of \"Ichthyovenator's\" original describers. In 2014, he mentioned that more of \"Icthyovenator's\" skeleton was dug up in 2012. He wrote this in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. These new bones include: several teeth, a hip bone, most neck bones, and a few back and tail bones. The description of the new bones has not been officially published.\nIn 2015, some of \"Ichthyovenator's\" bones were compared to the ones of \"Sigilmassasaurus. Sigilmassasaurus\" is another spinosaurid.\nDescription.\nPaleontologists estimate \"Ichthyovenator\" was about long. That's about as big as Baryonyx, one of its close relatives.\nIt had a half-meter sail or hump on its back, similar to \"Suchomimus\", or \"Spinosaurus\". Ichthyovenator's sail was unusual because it was split in two at the hips. Scientists don't know why it was like that.\nClassification.\n\"Ichthyovenator\" was first classified as a spinosaurid, inside the subfamily baryonychinae. This is the same subfamily that includes \"Baryonyx\" and \"Suchomimus\".\nIn 2014 it was found that \"Ichthyovenator\" was part of the subfamily spinosaurinae instead. This was because of specific features on its teeth, and because its backbones look much like the ones of \"Sigilmassasaurus\".\nSome sources say \"Ichthyovenator\" might not have been a spinosaurid. They say it may have been a sail-backed carcharodontosaurid, and that it was related to \"Concavenator\". But this hypothesis has not been published in an academic place.\nThe diagram below is called a cladogram. It shows how \"Ichthyovenator\" is related to other dinosaurs in its family tree.
