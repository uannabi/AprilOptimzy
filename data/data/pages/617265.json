It is described as a multisectoral market economy, where the state sector plays a crucial role in managing economic development with the possible long-term goal of developing socialism.\nThe socialist-oriented market economy is a product of \u0110\u1ED5i m\u1EDBi economic reforms, which led to the replacement of the centrally planned economy with a market-based mixed economy based on state-owned industry. These reforms were implemented to allow Vietnam to participate in the global market economy.\n\u0110\u1ED5i m\u1EDBi-economic reforms were initiated by the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1986 during the party's sixth national congress. These reforms allowed private ownership of small businesses together with state-owned and collectively-owned companies. In addition, these reforms also played a greater role in market forces in order to coordinate economic activity between companies and public authorities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam","offset":87},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialism","offset":293},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Vietnam","surface_form":"Communist Party of Vietnam","offset":651}]}
