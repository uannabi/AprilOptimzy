{"id":61731,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See","text":"The Holy See (Latin: \"Sancta Sedes\", \"holy seat\") is the office of the Bishop of Rome, that is, the Pope.\nThe term Holy See also means the Pope and the Roman Curia, the central government of the Roman Catholic Church.\nEvery episcopal see is seen as holy and the Eastern Orthodox Church constantly applies the adjective \"holy\" or \"sacred\" () to all its sees, but \"the Holy See\" (definite singular) normally means the see of Rome, which is also called \"the Apostolic See\". While \"Apostolic See\" can refer to any see founded by any of the Apostles, the term is in this case used to refer to the see of the bishop seen as successor of the chief of the Apostles, Saint Peter.\nAside from Rome, the archiepiscopal See of Mainz, which was also of electoral and primatial rank, is the only other Western see that bears the title of \"Holy See\", although this usage is less common.\nOrganization of the Holy See.\nThe Pope governs the Church through the Roman Curia. The Roman Curia consists of the Secretariat of State, nine Congregations, three Tribunals, 11 Pontifical Councils, and a complex of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level. The Secretariat of State, under the Cardinal Secretary of State, directs and coordinates the Curia. The current incumbent, Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, is the Holy See's equivalent of a prime minister. Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary of the Section for Relations With States of the Secretariat of State acts as the Holy See's foreign minister. Bertone and Mamberti have been named in their respective roles under by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2006.\nAmong the most active of the major Curial institutions are the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees church doctrine; the Congregation for Bishops, which coordinates the appointment of bishops worldwide; the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, which oversees all missionary activities; and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, which deals with international peace and social issues.\nInternational organizations.\nThe Holy See sends a delegate to the Arab League in Cairo. It is also a guest of honour to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nThe Holy See, not the Vatican City, maintains diplomatic relations with states (such as with the United Kingdom), and participates in international organizations. Foreign embassies are accredited to the Holy See, not to the Vatican City, and it is the Holy See that establishes treaties and concordats with other sovereign entities. When necessary, the Holy See will enter a treaty on behalf of the Vatican City.\nUnder the terms of the Lateran Treaty, the Holy See has extraterritorial authority over 23 sites in Rome and five Italian sites outside of Rome, including the Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo.\nThe same authority is extended under international law over the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See in a foreign country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":14},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"Bishop","offset":71},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":81},{"uri":"Pope","surface_form":"Pope","offset":100},{"uri":"Roman_Curia","surface_form":"Roman Curia","offset":152},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":195},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox Church","offset":262},{"uri":"Twelve_Apostles","surface_form":"Apostles","offset":536},{"uri":"Saint_Peter","surface_form":"Saint Peter","offset":658},{"uri":"Archbishop","surface_form":"archiepiscopal","offset":692},{"uri":"Archbishopric_of_Mainz","surface_form":"See of Mainz","offset":707},{"uri":"Prince-elector","surface_form":"electoral","offset":739},{"uri":"Primate_(religion)","surface_form":"primatial","offset":753},{"uri":"Roman_Curia","surface_form":"Roman Curia","offset":941},{"uri":"Secretariat_of_State_(Vatican)","surface_form":"Secretariat of State","offset":986},{"uri":"Congregation_(Roman_Curia)","surface_form":"Congregations","offset":1013},{"uri":"Ecclesiastical_court","surface_form":"Tribunal","offset":1034},{"uri":"Tarcisio_Cardinal_Bertone","surface_form":"Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone","offset":1270},{"uri":"Dominique_Mamberti","surface_form":"Dominique Mamberti","offset":1358},{"uri":"Pope_Benedict_XVI","surface_form":"Pope Benedict XVI","offset":1570},{"uri":"Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith","surface_form":"Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith","offset":1670},{"uri":"Congregation_for_Bishops","surface_form":"Congregation for Bishops","offset":1750},{"uri":"Congregation_for_the_Evangelization_of_Peoples","surface_form":"Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples","offset":1836},{"uri":"Pontifical_Council_for_Justice_and_Peace","surface_form":"Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace","offset":1934},{"uri":"Arab_League","surface_form":"Arab League","offset":2098},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":2113},{"uri":"Parliamentary_Assembly_of_the_Organization_for_Security_and_Cooperation_in_Europe","surface_form":"Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe","offset":2156},{"uri":"British_Ambassadors_to_the_Holy_See","surface_form":"with the United Kingdom","offset":2327},{"uri":"Embassy","surface_form":"embassies","offset":2410},{"uri":"Treaty","surface_form":"treaties","offset":2517},{"uri":"Concordat","surface_form":"concordat","offset":2530},{"uri":"Extraterritorial","surface_form":"extraterritorial authority","offset":2708},{"uri":"Castel_Gandolfo","surface_form":"Castel Gandolfo","offset":2832},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":2886},{"uri":"Apostolic_Nunciature","surface_form":"Apostolic Nunciature","offset":2913}]}
