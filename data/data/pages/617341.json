Semiotics is the study of how we attach meaning to the world around us and how we communicate that meaning to others.\nRelevant Historical Events.\n1857- Saussure was born in Geneva, Switzerland.\n1870s- Saussure studied Sanskrit, Latin and Ancient Greek at the University of Geneva.\n1876-1880- Saussure studies historical linguistics in the German cities of Leipzig and Berlin.\n1880- Saussure received his doctorate in Leipzig. He moved to Paris to become a professor in historical linguistics.\n1891- Saussure accepted the title of \u201CChevalier of the Legion of Honor\u201D after teaching for 11 years in Paris, at the \u00C9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00C9tudes. He returned to Geneva, accepting a job as a professor.\n1907-1911- For three years in a row, Saussure holds a lecture series about general linguistics.\n1916- Saussure\u2019s students put together notes from the lectures and publish them in a book called \"Cours de linguistique g\u00E9n\u00E9rale\" or \"Course on General Linguistics\"\nSaussure was a professor in historical linguistics, which is concerned with how languages relate to each other and how they change over time. This interest in how language changes over time can be called diachrony. Saussure was more interested in synchrony, which doesn\u2019t change over time. This means he looked at the parts of a language, as if they didn\u2019t change. Saussure studied the structure of language without comparing it to other languages and without focusing on change.\nSaussure distinguished two different parts of language, \"langue\" and \"parole\". \"Langue\" is the system of the language or the theory of the language. When we learn a language in school we are learning the \u201Clangue\u201D of the language: vocabulary words, grammatical structures, the order of words, etc. \"Parole\" is how the language is actually spoken. Often times, people speak in a way that is different from how language is taught in schools. We make mistakes, use slang words, and use figurative language. This is all part of parole. Saussure was more interested in studying the langue of a language. Parole was harder to study because the language people speak changes often. Studying the langue allowed Saussure to understand the basic structure of language.\nSaussure wanted to know how people communicate language with each other. In his \u201CCourse in General Linguistics\u201D, Saussure first defines language and how it is involved in speech.\nDefining Language.\nMany different factors work together to create language.\nTo summarize, Saussure describes language as our ability to represent meaning by using signs (the words themselves and the way they sound when spoken). In the process of communicating with another individual, language can be found in the process of taking meaning from the words that we hear (which make up an \u201Cauditory image\u201D). This process is psychological, while producing signs is the physiological process of speech. To study language, we focus on the psychological process.\nLanguage is studied apart from speech. It does not exist among one person but among the community of people that use it. Each member of the community shares a knowledge of the language but cannot change the system of the language individually. Language as a stable system can be studied scientifically, which is the goal of linguistics.\nSaussure also focuses on the arbitrary nature of signs.This means that a word and the sounds that make up a word don\u2019t tell us anything about word means. For example, the word \u201Cdog\u201D doesn\u2019t tell us about what a dog is. The letters and sounds chosen are not special.\u00A0 Most words are chosen in this way. A small amount of words are not. For example in the word \u201Cslap\u201D, the letters sound like the noise you hear when you slap something. The arbitrary nature of sounds allows us to make many words. If every letter had a single meaning, then we could only create a small number of words with that letter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguistics","offset":77},{"uri":"Semiotics","surface_form":"semiotics","offset":93},{"uri":"Geneva","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":277},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":285},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":322},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":332},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":342},{"uri":"Historical_linguistics","surface_form":"historical linguistics","offset":413},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":460},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":472},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctorate","offset":508},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":542},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":1144},{"uri":"Vocabulary","surface_form":"vocabulary","offset":1774},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammatical structures","offset":1792},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"the order of words","offset":1816}]}
