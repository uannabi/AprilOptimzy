{"id":617387,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was an American immigration policy that allowed some individuals who entered the country as minors, and had either entered or remained in the country illegally, to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and to be eligible for a work permit.\nAs of 2017, about 800,000 individuals\u2014referred to as Dreamers after the DREAM Act bill\u2014were enrolled in the program created by DACA. The policy was established by the Obama Administration in June 2012 and rescinded by the Trump Administration in September 2017. In November 2014 President Barack Obama announced his intention to expand DACA to cover additional illegal immigrants. But multiple states immediately sued to prevent the expansion, which was ultimately blocked by the courts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":70},{"uri":"Immigration_policy","surface_form":"immigration policy","offset":79},{"uri":"Deferred_action","surface_form":"deferred action","offset":266},{"uri":"Work_permit","surface_form":"work permit","offset":324},{"uri":"DREAM_Act","surface_form":"DREAM Act bill","offset":409},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Obama Administration","offset":504},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Trump Administration","offset":559},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":626}]}
