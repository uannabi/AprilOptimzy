Its fossils look very similar to the ones from \"Baryonyx\" and \"Suchomimus.\"\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe first specimens were found in Niger in 1973 by a french paleontologist named Philippe Taquet. The name of the animal refers to the latin word for crest, \"crista\",\" because it had a crest on its snout. The species \"lapparenti\" is named after another french paleontologist called Albert-F\u00E9lix de Lapparent. The fossils discovered so far include two broken snout bones, some pieces from the upper and lower jaws, a claw, and four backbones (also called \"vertebrae\"). Scientists aren't sure if \"Cristatusaurus\" is a new species, some of them say it could be the same dinosaur as \"Suchomimus\" or \"Baryonyx.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":23},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":35},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":44},{"uri":"Early_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Early Cretaceous","offset":62},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":82},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":99},{"uri":"Baryonyx","surface_form":"Baryonyx","offset":143},{"uri":"Suchomimus","surface_form":"Suchomimus","offset":158},{"uri":"Niger","surface_form":"Niger","offset":227},{"uri":"Paleontologist","surface_form":"paleontologist","offset":253},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":402},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":557},{"uri":"Backbone","surface_form":"backbone","offset":624}]}
