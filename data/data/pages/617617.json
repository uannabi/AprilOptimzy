{"id":617617,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suchosaurus","text":"\"Suchosaurus\" (meaning \"crocodile lizard\") is a carnivorous theropod dinosaur from Cretaceous England, it was mistaken for a genus of Crocodile when it was found. The first fossils were of its teeth, two species have been named so far.\nHistory of discovery.\nIn 1820, scientist Gideon Mantell got hold of some fossilized teeth discovered near East Sussex, and in 1822, the British naturalist William Clift identified them as crocodile teeth. Two years later in 1824, Georges Cuvier mentioned them in the first interpretation of a spinosaurid fossil. But at the time, paleontologists didn't know about the crocodile-like teeth of spinosaurids\nIn 1897 the second species \"Suchosaurus girardi\" was named, after two pieces of its jaw and one tooth were found in Portugal.\nDuring the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, scientists thought that \"Suchosaurus\" was probably some kind of obscure Crocodilian. But in 1998, paleontologist Angela Milner was publishing a new description of \"Baryonyx\", and she realized that the teeth of that spinosaurid dinosaur were extremely similar to those from \"Suchosaurus\". Later in 2003, she suggested that they could be the same animal. \"Suchosaurus\" teeth are also very close to the ones from \"Cristatusaurus\" and \"Suchomimus\", all this means it has the general features of a member from the family Baryonychinae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":48},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":60},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":69},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":83},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":94},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":125},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"Crocodile","offset":134},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":173},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":204},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":267},{"uri":"Gideon_Mantell","surface_form":"Gideon Mantell","offset":277},{"uri":"East_Sussex","surface_form":"East Sussex","offset":342},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British","offset":372},{"uri":"Georges_Cuvier","surface_form":"Georges Cuvier","offset":466},{"uri":"Spinosauridae","surface_form":"spinosaurid","offset":529},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":757},{"uri":"Crocodilia","surface_form":"Crocodilia","offset":896},{"uri":"Paleontologist","surface_form":"paleontologist","offset":922},{"uri":"Angela_Milner","surface_form":"Angela Milner","offset":937},{"uri":"Baryonyx","surface_form":"Baryonyx","offset":988},{"uri":"Cristatusaurus","surface_form":"Cristatusaurus","offset":1235},{"uri":"Suchomimus","surface_form":"Suchomimus","offset":1256},{"uri":"Baryonychinae","surface_form":"Baryonychinae","offset":1340}]}
