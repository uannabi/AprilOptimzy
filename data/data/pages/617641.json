{"id":617641,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Can_Do_It%21","text":"\"We Can Do It!\" is an American wartime propaganda poster produced by J. Howard Miller in 1943 for Westinghouse Electric as an inspirational image to boost worker morale. It actively became popular in the 1980s feminist movement.\nThe poster was very little seen during World War II. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called \"We Can Do It!\" but also called \"Rosie the Riveter\" (modeled by Naomi Parker) after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker.\nThe image made the cover of the \"Smithsonian\" magazine in 1994 and was fashioned into a US first-class mail stamp in 1999.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"wartime","offset":31},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":39},{"uri":"J._Howard_Miller","surface_form":"J.
