{"id":61765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_notation","text":"Prefix notation is a mathematical notation. It is a way to write down equations and other mathematical formulae. Prefix notation is also known as \"Polish notation\". The notation was invented by Jan \u0141ukasiewicz in 1920. He wanted to simplify writing logic equations.\nWhen prefix notation is used, no grouping elements (like parenthesis) are needed.\nWith prefix notation, the function is noted before the arguments it operates on.\nSome CASIO calculators use prefix notation. Some programming languages that were influenced by lambda calculus, like LISP, use prefix notation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematical_notation","surface_form":"mathematical notation","offset":21},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":70},{"uri":"Formula","surface_form":"formula","offset":103},{"uri":"Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz","surface_form":"Jan \u0141ukasiewicz","offset":194},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":213},{"uri":"CASIO","surface_form":"CASIO","offset":434},{"uri":"Calculator","surface_form":"calculator","offset":440},{"uri":"Lambda_calculus","surface_form":"lambda calculus","offset":524},{"uri":"LISP","surface_form":"LISP","offset":546}]}
