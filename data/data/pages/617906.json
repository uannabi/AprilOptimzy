His main research interest deals with the relationships between hominins and plants from a palaeoecological perspective. He has conducted and co-ordinated a number of research projects on the palaeoflora and palaeovegetation of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands, ecological changes linked to patterns and processes of human and cultural evolution, eco-cultural collapses, extinctions in plants, palaeoecology and biodiversity conservation and forest management, palaeoenvironments of arid regions, pollen analysis of biogenic materials and archaeological sites, pollen analyses of honeys, aerobiological monitoring (Burkard filters), forensic palynology, and spore and pollen-morphological studies. He is full professor of Evolutionary Botany at University of Murcia, where he leads the Research Group ECCE HOMO (Evolution, Cenozoic, Quaternary, Ecology, Homo). He is currently editor in chief of Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology, and Associate Editor of Quaternary Science Reviews, Elsevier.\nEducation.\nUniversity of Murcia: 1985.
