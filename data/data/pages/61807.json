{"id":61807,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Waldheim","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kurt Josef Waldheim (21 December 1918 \u2013 14 June 2007) was an Austrian diplomat and conservative politician. He was Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981, and President of Austria from 1986 to 1992.\nPolitical career.\nShortly before 1986, Waldheim published an autobiography. During his campaign to become president in 1986, it became public that some statements in that biography were not true. These were about his past. Waldheim was an officer for Germany in the Second World War. He rose to be an oberleutnant in the Wehrmacht. Much historical interest has centered on Waldheim's role in Operation Kozara in 1942. According to one post-war investigator, prisoners were routinely shot within only a few hundred meters (yards) of Waldheim's office, and away at the Jasenovac concentration camp. Waldheim later stated that \"he did not know about the murder of civilians there\".\nThere was a commission of several historians who looked at the issue. They did find that Waldheim had behaved as he should have done. He did not commit any war crimes. However, in his role of an officer, he must have known about the deportation of about 40.000 Jews into concentration camps. These transports, as well as the shooting of soldiers were a clear breach of law.\nBecause of this, he was not allowed to travel to the United States any more.\nIn 1990, he had a success: Saddam Hussein held several foreigners as hostages at the start of the Second Gulf War. When Waldheim heard this, he personally went to Baghdad. Through talks he could get Saddam to release the Austrian and the Swiss hostages. (both countries are neutral)\nDeath.\nOn June 14, 2007, Waldheim died of heart failure. At the time of his death he was the oldest living former Secretary-General of the United Nations and the oldest living former President of Austria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":74},{"uri":"Diplomat","surface_form":"diplomat","offset":83},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":109},{"uri":"United_Nations_Secretary-General","surface_form":"Secretary-General","offset":128},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":153},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":191},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":204},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiography","offset":292},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":482},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":497},{"uri":"Oberleutnant","surface_form":"oberleutnant","offset":532},{"uri":"Wehrmacht","surface_form":"Wehrmacht","offset":552},{"uri":"Operation_Kozara","surface_form":"Operation Kozara","offset":623},{"uri":"Jasenovac_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Jasenovac concentration camp","offset":798},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":944},{"uri":"War_crime","surface_form":"war crime","offset":1066},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":1171},{"uri":"Concentration_camp","surface_form":"concentration camp","offset":1181},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1337},{"uri":"Saddam_Hussein","surface_form":"Saddam Hussein","offset":1388},{"uri":"Foreigner","surface_form":"foreigner","offset":1416},{"uri":"Hostages","surface_form":"hostages","offset":1430},{"uri":"Second_Gulf_War","surface_form":"Second Gulf War","offset":1459},{"uri":"Baghdad","surface_form":"Baghdad","offset":1524},{"uri":"Neutrality_(international_relations)","surface_form":"neutral","offset":1635},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":1686}]}
