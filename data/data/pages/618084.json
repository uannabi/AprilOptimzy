They lived from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous period. Members of the group include \"Spinosaurus\", \"Megalosaurus\", and \"Torvosaurus\".\nClassification.\nThe definition of the clade Megalosauroidea includes \"Megalosaurus bucklandii\" and all taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with it than they do with \"Allosaurus fragilis\" or the House Sparrow.\nHere is a cladogram showing the relationships between different members of Megalosauroidea.
