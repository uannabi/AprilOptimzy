The first officially recognized Test match took place on 15\u201319 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Australia won by 45 runs.\nTest matches eventually spread to other countries around the world. Later came One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 internationals (T20s).\nTest matches are a series of 5-day matches. Each team's two innings' scores are added to find the total runs. The team with more runs wins the match if the other team has completed both of their innings, with there being a tie if they have an equal number of runs; otherwise it is a draw.\nFollow-on.\nFollow-on is a rule by which the team batting in second innings can be enforced to bat again just after the end of their first innings. The follow-on can be enforced by the team batted in the first innings only if their first-innings lead is at least 200 runs.\nTimeless Test.\nTimeless Test matches are Test matches with no limit on the number of days the game can be played for.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":61},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":167},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":179},{"uri":"Melbourne_Cricket_Ground","surface_form":"Melbourne Cricket Ground","offset":196},{"uri":"One_Day_International","surface_form":"One Day Internationals","offset":333},{"uri":"Twenty20_International","surface_form":"Twenty20 internationals","offset":367}]}
