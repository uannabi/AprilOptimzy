It is the home of the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB).\nDuring the stadium's planning process, it was named SunTrust Park when the Braves reached a naming agreement with the Atlanta-based SunTrust banking company. In February 2019, SunTrust merged with another banking company, BB&T, and the new company renamed itself Truist. However, the ballpark kept the SunTrust name through the 2019 season. The new name of Truist Park became official on January 14, 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baseball_stadium","surface_form":"baseball stadium","offset":53},{"uri":"Cobb_County%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Cobb County","offset":86},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":99},{"uri":"Atlanta","surface_form":"Atlanta","offset":119},{"uri":"Atlanta_Braves","surface_form":"Atlanta Braves","offset":166},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":184}]}
