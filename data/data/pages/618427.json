He was the USA Gymnastics national team doctor and an osteopathic physician at Michigan State University.\nNassar's acts of assault sparked the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, in which he was accused of molesting at least 150 underage girls, including a number of well-known Olympic gymnasts. The allegations against him date as far back as 1992. He has admitted to at least ten of the accusations. Some writers described him as a hebephilic doctor.\nIn July 2017, Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. On January 24, 2018, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in a state prison in Michigan after pleading guilty to the sexual assault of minors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Syrian_American","surface_form":"Syrian American","offset":64},{"uri":"Child_sexual_abuse","surface_form":"child molester","offset":97},{"uri":"USA_Gymnastics","surface_form":"USA Gymnastics","offset":124},{"uri":"Osteopathic_physician","surface_form":"osteopathic physician","offset":167},{"uri":"Michigan_State_University_College_of_Osteopathic_Medicine","surface_form":"Michigan State University","offset":192},{"uri":"USA_Gymnastics_sex_abuse_scandal","surface_form":"USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal","offset":256},{"uri":"Child_pornography","surface_form":"child pornography","offset":654}]}
