{"id":618476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_glands","text":"Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and all tetrapods,embedded in the posterior surface of the Thyroid glands.\nFunction.\nThese glands produce parathyroid hormones (PTH). This has an important role in controlling the amount of calcium in blood and bones. Calcium is an important element in our body: it is the only element with its own control system (the parathyroid glands).\nStructure.\nThere are two pairs of parathyroid glands, just behind the thyroid glands. Each gland is about 6\u00A0mm long and 3\u20134\u00A0mm wide. Parathyroid glands get their blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Endocrine_gland","surface_form":"endocrine gland","offset":29},{"uri":"Tetrapods","surface_form":"tetrapods","offset":76},{"uri":"Thyroid","surface_form":"Thyroid glands","offset":127},{"uri":"Parathyroid_hormone","surface_form":"parathyroid hormone","offset":174},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"calcium","offset":258},{"uri":"Thyroid","surface_form":"thyroid glands","offset":478}]}
