{"id":618519,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Country_Squire","text":"The Ford Country Squire was a station wagon from Ford Motor Company. It was first made in 1950. The car got started as a \"woodie\", a car with wood material making up part of the car. But by 1952, the Country Squire was no longer a true woodie. However, all Country Squires were made with steel and wood.\nFrom the 1960s to the early 1980s, many variations of the Squire name were used on wood-grained cars, like the LTD II, Falcon, Escort and the mid-sized LTD.\nDuring the mid-1980s, sales of full-size station wagons began to go down. This was after the Chrysler and Ford Aerostar minivans began being made.\nAt Ford, the role for the 8-passenger station wagon was given to Mercury Sable and Ford Taurus in 1992.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Station_wagon","surface_form":"station wagon","offset":30},{"uri":"Ford_Motor_Company","surface_form":"Ford Motor Company","offset":49},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":100},{"uri":"LTD_II","surface_form":"LTD II","offset":415},{"uri":"Ford_Falcon","surface_form":"Falcon","offset":423},{"uri":"Chrysler","surface_form":"Chrysler","offset":554},{"uri":"Ford_Aerostar","surface_form":"Ford Aerostar","offset":567},{"uri":"Van","surface_form":"minivans","offset":581},{"uri":"Mercury_Sable","surface_form":"Mercury Sable","offset":673},{"uri":"Ford_Taurus","surface_form":"Ford Taurus","offset":691}]}
