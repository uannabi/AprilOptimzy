{"id":618545,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interslavic_language","text":"Interslavic is a constructed language meant to be used by Slavic people. It is like a modern version of the Old Church Slavonic language of the 9th century. It is based on words and other things that exist in all Slavic languages. The idea is that Slavs from any country can understand it without learning it first.\nHistory.\nThe first Interslavic grammar was written in 1659\u20131666 by Juraj Kri\u017Eani\u0107, a priest from Croatia. The modern form was started in 2006 by a team of linguists. The name of that project was Slovianski. In 2011 it merged with another project called Neoslavonic'\". Since that time the name of the language is Interslavic (\"Med\u017Euslovjansky\").\nInterslavic can be written in the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. It is spoken by several hundreds of people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constructed_language","surface_form":"constructed language","offset":17},{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic people","offset":58},{"uri":"Old_Church_Slavonic","surface_form":"Old Church Slavonic","offset":108},{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic languages","offset":213},{"uri":"Roman_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin","offset":695},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic","offset":705}]}
