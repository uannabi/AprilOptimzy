{"id":61861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaborone","text":"Gaborone is the capital city of Botswana. It has a population of 231,626 people. Gaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa. Gaborone is on the Notwane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana. It is from the South African border.\nThe main campus of the University of Botswana is in the city. Gaborone's airport, Sir Seretse Khama International Airport, is Botswana's main international airport.\nHistory.\nBefore 1969, the city was known as Gaberones. Gaberones replaced Mafeking as the capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate in 1965. Mafeking was outside the Bechuanaland Protectorate. It was in an area of South Africa. When the Protectorate became independent, Botswana needed a capital city that was inside the country. It had been thought that Lobatse would be the capital. It was later decided that they would create a new capital next to Gaberones, a small colonial administrative settlement.\nThe original name, Gaberones, is from Gaborone's Village. It was named after Chief Kgosi Gaborone of the BaTlokwa tribe. His village, now called Tlokweng, was just across a river from the \"Government Camp\" (colonial government headquarters). \"Gabs\" is still a common nickname for Gaborone. A newer nickname for Gaborone is G-City.\nThe centre of the city was constructed in three years. It includes Assembly buildings, government offices, a power station, a hospital, schools, a radio station, a telephone exchange, police stations, a post office, and more than 1,000 houses. Much of the city was in place for Independence Day on September 30 1966, when the county became independent of the United Kingdom. The first mayor of Gaborone was Rev J. D. Jones. The old Gaberones became a suburb of the new Gaborone, and is now known as \"the Village\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":16},{"uri":"Botswana","surface_form":"Botswana","offset":32},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":51},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":130},{"uri":"Notwane_River","surface_form":"Notwane River","offset":157},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":226},{"uri":"University_of_Botswana","surface_form":"University of Botswana","offset":271},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":321},{"uri":"Sir_Seretse_Khama_International_Airport","surface_form":"Sir Seretse Khama International Airport","offset":330},{"uri":"Mafeking","surface_form":"Mafeking","offset":487},{"uri":"Bechuanaland_Protectorate","surface_form":"Bechuanaland Protectorate","offset":518},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":626},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":669},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":733},{"uri":"Lobatse","surface_form":"Lobatse","offset":767},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonial","offset":882},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative","offset":891},{"uri":"Settler","surface_form":"settlement","offset":906},{"uri":"Kgosi_Gaborone","surface_form":"Kgosi Gaborone","offset":1001},{"uri":"BaTlokwa","surface_form":"BaTlokwa","offset":1023},{"uri":"Tlokweng","surface_form":"Tlokweng","offset":1063},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":1091},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1134},{"uri":"Headquarter","surface_form":"headquarter","offset":1145},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":1185},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":1325},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"power","offset":1358},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":1375},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":1385},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio station","offset":1396},{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone exchange","offset":1413},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":1433},{"uri":"Mail","surface_form":"post office","offset":1452},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":1485},{"uri":"September_30","surface_form":"September 30","offset":1547},{"uri":"1966","surface_form":"1966","offset":1560},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1608},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":1634},{"uri":"J._D._Jones","surface_form":"J.
