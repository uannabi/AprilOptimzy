{"id":619030,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihonium","text":"Nihonium(\u30CB\u30DB\u30CB\u30A6\u30E0) is a chemical element. It is also named eka-thallium. It has the symbol Nh. It has the atomic number 113. It is a transuranium element.The name nihonium from Japan\"s name nihon\u30CB\u30DB\u30F3.\nNihonium does not exist in nature, but is artificial. It is made from the alpha decay of moscovium.\nThere are no known uses for nihonium. What nihonium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight. Based on trends in the Periodic Table it could be soft, silver color, very reactive metal like sodium.\nHistory.\nOn February 1 2004, Nihonium and moscovium were discovered. A team of Russian scientists at Dubna from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and American scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory first reported the chemical elements.\nOn September 28 2004, a team of Japanese scientists said that they had made the element.,\nIn May 2006, in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research made nihonium using a different method. They found the identity of the last products of the radioactive decay of the nihonium they made.\nName.\nUnuntrium was a temporary IUPAC systematic element name.\nScientists from Japan suggested the name \"japonium\" (symbol \"Jp\") or \"rikenium\" (\"Rk\").However, they picked Nihonium because not only is it discovered in Japan, but it means Japan, too, as nihon is Japan or Japanese in Japanese.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":21},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":103},{"uri":"Transuranium_element","surface_form":"transuranium element","offset":130},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"nihon","offset":187},{"uri":"Artificial","surface_form":"artificial","offset":239},{"uri":"Moscovium","surface_form":"moscovium","offset":286},{"uri":"Periodic_Table","surface_form":"Periodic Table","offset":460},{"uri":"Chemical_reactivity","surface_form":"reactive","offset":512},{"uri":"Sodium","surface_form":"sodium","offset":532},{"uri":"February_1","surface_form":"February 1","offset":552},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":563},{"uri":"Moscovium","surface_form":"moscovium","offset":582},{"uri":"Discovery_(observation)","surface_form":"discovered","offset":597},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":619},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":627},{"uri":"Dubna","surface_form":"Dubna","offset":641},{"uri":"Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","surface_form":"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research","offset":656},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":697},{"uri":"Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory","surface_form":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","offset":724},{"uri":"Report","surface_form":"report","offset":769},{"uri":"September_28","surface_form":"September 28","offset":804},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":817},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":833},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":898},{"uri":"Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","surface_form":"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research","offset":911},{"uri":"Identity","surface_form":"identity","offset":1003},{"uri":"IUPAC","surface_form":"IUPAC","offset":1117},{"uri":"Systematic_element_name","surface_form":"systematic element name","offset":1123}]}
