{"id":619144,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Clarke","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dr Rachel Clarke is a published author and medical doctor specialising in palliative care for the NHS in England. From 2015 Dr Clarke has had an active voice in the debate regarding junior doctors pay rights in the United Kingdom, apearing in multiple television debates on this issue.\nBiography.\nBefore re-training as a doctor at age 29, Rachel Clarke worked as a journalist producing and directing current-affairs documentaries. Some of these documentaries focused on subjects such as Al Qaeda, the Gulf War and the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, otherwise know as the Second Congo War.\nHer motivation for the previously mentioned activism began when the Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, sought to impose a new contract upon junior doctors. Dr Clarke campaigned against the government, arguing in print and on screen that imposition would irrevocably damage the NHS. Her debut book 'Your Life In My Hands' was published by John Blake in July 2017.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Health_Service","surface_form":"NHS","offset":111},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":228},{"uri":"Current_affairs_(news_format)","surface_form":"current-affairs","offset":413},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda","surface_form":"Al Qaeda","offset":500},{"uri":"Gulf_War","surface_form":"the Gulf War","offset":510},{"uri":"Second_Congo_War","surface_form":"Second Congo War","offset":600},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care","surface_form":"Secretary of State for Health","offset":686},{"uri":"Jeremy_Hunt","surface_form":"Jeremy Hunt","offset":717}]}
