The Show stars Rhea Sharma and Avinesh Rekhi and is the sequel to the series Diya Aur Baati Hum. Neelu Vaghela, Ashok Lokhande, and Kanika Maheshwari reprise their roles from that series.\nPLOT / STORY.\nThe story is based o the life of the children of Sooraj and Sandhya, focusing on their daughter, Kanak. Her grandmother Bhabho ignores and looks down upon Kanak because according to her, Kanak is to blame for her (Kanak's) parents' death, but later upon realising her love for Kanak, Bhabho accepts her as family. Later, Kanak gets married to a superstitious but good-hearted gentleman, named Uma Shankar. He is a blind believer in morals taught by his greedy and hypocrite maternal aunt, Nanda Devi. Kanak sets off on a journey with Uma Shankar, who is her perfect opposite, to teach him the greatest moral of life - humanity - while she is criticized by Palomi and repeatedly harmed by Maasi Saa, and later, her lewd son, Aditya. In the process, she herself falls in love with Uma after establishing herself as the perfect wife for him. In a subplot taking place in Bangkok, Uma and Kanak plot to expose Maasi Saa and Aditya, and prove that Palomi is alive. They succeed in doing so and are about to live happily until Uma shockingly marries Meera Mittal, daughter of a rich businessman for some unknown reason, ditching Kanak.\nThe story then takes a two-year leap and Kanak eventually reappears in Uma's life, who is now shown as a successful business tycoon. After a lot of misunderstandings, it is revealed that Uma still loves Kanak and he was actually blackmailed and forced into marrying Meera to save his sister Suman's life. Meera gets mad with jealousy and vows to destroy Kanak\u2019s life. She alongside Aditya tries many heinous ways to separate the duo including attempting to marry off Kanak to a man who is also after her, but fails every time and eventually gets arrested thanks to a cunning plan made by Kanak. Aditya also realises his mistake and has a change of heart, becoming loyal towards his brother. Kanak gets rid of her hatred towards Uma and the couple are united again. It is then that Maasi Saa comes out of jail with the same evil intention of decimating the protagonists.\nSaras (Uma's sister) meanwhile suffers an unfortunate miscarriage, and seeing Uma's grief over the matter Kanak with the help of Aditya launches a Bike Ambulance so that every emergency patient gets admitted to the hospital as quickly as possible. But this noble idea creates many enemies for Uma and Kanak from the very outset and Dr. Parag, Dean of Pratistha Medical College joins hands with Maasi Saa to cancel Uma's license so that he can use the idea to flourish his own Medical College and take the credit wholly upon himself. Kanak decides to study Paramedicals and become a doctor herself to save the license from being cancelled and no one can label her as amateur when she treats any patient. After facing several hurdles and hindrances in the college set up by Dr. Parag himself, she at last succeeds in removing the mask out of Dr. Parag's face, unveiling his true nature in front of the public and gets him behind bars. It is revealed before that Maasi Saa was ill-treated by Dr. Parag while in jail, and she was planning for revenge ever since she got out of jail. She later stops plotting against Uma and Kanak and becomes kind towards them.\nUma at this time receives a fake call and gets attacked by some goons who also trashes his Bike Ambulance. He recovers some months later, but loses his memory and to everyone's surprise turns into that same superstitious person he used to be before. He asks Kanak to either choose him or to pursue the Paramedics course as he is against the idea of her studying. However, Kanak chooses to continue her dream of becoming a doctor. Uma supports her decision and Aditya then reveals that it was Uma's plan all along to infuse some confidence and passion inside Kanak which she was lacking hitherto, and that he never lost his memory. With her husband at her side, the story finally ends on a happy note as Kanak sets off for her new career with the blessings of Bhabo and other elders.\nRemakes.\nBecause of it's Popularity it is remaded in several language.
