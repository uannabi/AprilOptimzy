{"id":61948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niamey","text":"Niamey is the capital city of the African country of Niger. It is Niger's largest city. The city is on the Niger River. Naimey is the administrative, cultural and economic center of the country. The city has 674,950 people.\nThe city is in a pearl millet growing region. Manufacturing industries in the city include bricks, ceramic goods, cement and weaving.\nHistory.\nNiamey was probably founded during the 18th century. It was of little importance until the French created a colonial post there in the 1890s. The city grew quickly after that happened. In 1926, it became the capital of Niger. The number of people grew slowly from about 3,000 people in 1930 to around 30,000 in 1960, 250,000 in 1980 and 675,000 in 2002. The major cause of the increase has been immigration during droughts.\nThings to see.\nThings to see in the city include the Niger National Museum. The museum includes a zoo, a museum of vernacular architecture, a craft centre, and displays including dinosaur skeletons and the Tree of T\u00E9n\u00E9r\u00E9. The city also has American, French and Nigerien cultural centres, two major markets, and a traditional wrestling arena.\nThe city is the site of Diori Hamani International Airport, the National School of Administration, and Abdou Moumouni University of Niamey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":14},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":34},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":42},{"uri":"Niger","surface_form":"Niger","offset":53},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":92},{"uri":"Niger_River","surface_form":"Niger River","offset":107},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administrative","offset":134},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":150},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economic","offset":163},{"uri":"Pearl_millet","surface_form":"pearl millet","offset":241},{"uri":"Manufacture","surface_form":"Manufacturing","offset":270},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industries","offset":284},{"uri":"Brick","surface_form":"brick","offset":315},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":323},{"uri":"Cement","surface_form":"cement","offset":338},{"uri":"Weaving","surface_form":"weaving","offset":349},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"founded","offset":387},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":406},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":458},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonial post","offset":475},{"uri":"1890s","surface_form":"1890s","offset":502},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":555},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":762},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":781},{"uri":"Niger_National_Museum","surface_form":"Niger National Museum","offset":844},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":871},{"uri":"Zoo","surface_form":"zoo","offset":889},{"uri":"Vernacular_architecture","surface_form":"vernacular architecture","offset":906},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":933},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":970},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":979},{"uri":"Tree_of_T%C3%A9n%C3%A9r%C3%A9","surface_form":"Tree of T\u00E9n\u00E9r\u00E9","offset":997},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1031},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":1041},{"uri":"Market","surface_form":"market","offset":1089},{"uri":"Wrestling","surface_form":"wrestling","offset":1116},{"uri":"Diori_Hamani_International_Airport","surface_form":"Diori Hamani International Airport","offset":1157},{"uri":"National_School_of_Administration","surface_form":"National School of Administration","offset":1197},{"uri":"Abdou_Moumouni_University_of_Niamey","surface_form":"Abdou Moumouni University of Niamey","offset":1236}]}
