{"id":619487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_division","text":"but it can be divided by any polynomial with one variable.\nSynthetic division can be used to make calculations without writing variables. It also uses a small number of calculations, and takes less room on paper than long division. The subtractions in long division are changed to additions by changing the signs at the very beginning, which keeps sign errors from happening.\nSynthetic division for linear denominators is also called division in\u00A0Ruffini's rule.\nRegular synthetic division.\nThe first example is synthetic division with only a single-variable linear denominator formula_1.\nThe coefficients of the polynomial to divide are put at the top (the zero is for the invisible 0\"x\").\nMake the coefficients of the denominator\u00A0negative.\nPut every coefficient of the divisor except the first one on the left.\nPut the first number after the bar, 1, at the bottom.\nMultiply the dropped number by the number before the bar, and put it under the next coefficient, 12.\nAdd the numbers in the second column (which equals -9 in this example).\nCount the terms to the left of the bar. Since there is only one, the remainder has degree zero, which means it is a\u00A0constant\u00A0that is more than zero. Put an up and down line next to the last number, -123.\nThe terms are written with a rising degree from right to left. It begins with degree zero for both the remainder and the result.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ruffini%27s_rule","surface_form":"Ruffini's rule","offset":446},{"uri":"Denominator","surface_form":"denominator","offset":565},{"uri":"Coefficients","surface_form":"coefficients","offset":592},{"uri":"Terms","surface_form":"terms","offset":1049},{"uri":"Remainder","surface_form":"remainder","offset":1108},{"uri":"Constant","surface_form":"constant","offset":1155}]}
