{"id":61949,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Roman","text":"The Basic Roman system serves no particular standard of English pronunciation. Instead, it gives one way to spell the different varieties of English. The system uses 22 Roman letters to represent the set of English phonemes considered by J.C. Wells. The letters \u2018j\u2019, \u2018q\u2019, \u2018w\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 are not used (letters \u2018j\u2019 and \u2018w\u2019 are used in an extended version of the Basic Roman spelling, see below).\nApart from respelling of English, the Basic Roman could also be used as the target spelling of a universal algorithm for the designing of superior, user-friendly Romanization systems transliterating and transcribing a variety of languages. This \u2018streamlined approach\u2019 has been successfully tested in the case of Bulgarian language, with the 1995 Streamlined System for the Romanization of Bulgarian becoming established in Bulgaria (eventually codified in a 2009 law), and adopted also by UN in 2012, and for official US and UK use by BGN and PCGN in 2013. Recently this approach has been used to design the 2017 Streamlined System for the Romanization of Russian aimed at replacing the plethora of systems currently occurring in the non-academic practice of transliteration of Russian Cyrillic.\nThe Extended Basic Roman is close to one-to-one phoneme-grapheme correspondence, paving the way to a pronunciation respelling for English by means of the closely related Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English.\nRoman Phonetic Alphabet for English.\nThe Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English is a system based on the Extended Basic Roman spelling of English. It includes two pairs of stress marks which disambiguate words which share the same spelling but have different meanings. This is to get a one-to-one phoneme (sound)\u2013grapheme (spelling) correspondence. The system has certain similarities to the systems of the NBC Handbook of Pronunciation, the Carnegie Mellon version of Arpabet alphabet, and the World Book Dictionary.\nPrimary stress is indicated by the mark <\u2019>, respectively <\u201D> in the case of \\\\ and \\\\. Secondary stress is shown by <,> and <\u201E> respectively. Stress marks are placed before the syllables concerned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bulgarian_language","surface_form":"Bulgarian language","offset":703},{"uri":"Romanization_of_Bulgarian","surface_form":"Streamlined System for the Romanization of Bulgarian","offset":737},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"UN","offset":880},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"US","offset":909},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"U","offset":916},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Russian Cyrillic","offset":1169},{"uri":"Phoneme","surface_form":"phoneme","offset":1235},{"uri":"Grapheme","surface_form":"grapheme","offset":1243},{"uri":"Roman_Phonetic_Alphabet_for_English","surface_form":"Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English","offset":1357},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1463},{"uri":"Phoneme","surface_form":"phoneme","offset":1688},{"uri":"Grapheme","surface_form":"grapheme","offset":1704},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":1798}]}
