{"id":61957,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buto","text":"e=\"preserve\">Buto or Butos or Butosos, was the later, Greek name for an ancient Egyptian city 95\u00A0km east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta of Egypt. It is the modern \"Kem Kasir\".\nHistory.\nButo originally was two cities, Pe and Dep, which merged into one city that the Egyptians named \"Per-Wadjet\". The goddess Wadjet was its local goddess, often represented as a cobra, and she was considered the patron deity of Lower Egypt.\nThe city was an important site in Ancient Egypt since more than ten thousand years. Archaeological evidence shows that Upper Egyptian culture replaced the Buto-culture at the delta when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified.\nUses.\nThe Greek historians told that town was celebrated for its temple and oracle of the goddess Wadjet.\nThey also told that at Buto there was also a sanctuary of Horus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Egyptian","offset":80},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":108},{"uri":"Nile_Delta","surface_form":"Nile Delta","offset":126},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":140},{"uri":"Pe","surface_form":"Pe","offset":218},{"uri":"Dep","surface_form":"Dep","offset":225},{"uri":"Wadjet","surface_form":"Wadjet","offset":308},{"uri":"Cobra","surface_form":"cobra","offset":361},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":458},{"uri":"Upper_Egypt","surface_form":"Upper Egypt","offset":543},{"uri":"Lower_Egypt","surface_form":"Lower Egypt","offset":620},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":711},{"uri":"Oracle","surface_form":"oracle","offset":722},{"uri":"Horus","surface_form":"Horus","offset":810}]}
