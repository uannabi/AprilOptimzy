{"id":619664,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadejia_River","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Hadejia River (known as \"kogin Ha\u0257eja\" in Hausa language) is a river in northern Nigeria and is a part of the Yobe River (Komadugu Yobe).\nThe river flows through Hadejia and Nguru.\nWater from the river has been held back in a process called damming for the purposes of irrigation. This has reduced the amount of water in the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands, which the river forms along with Nguru Lake.\nThe Hadejia river is now 80% controlled by the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams in Kano State.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":98},{"uri":"Yobe_River","surface_form":"Yobe River","offset":127},{"uri":"Hadejia","surface_form":"Hadejia","offset":179},{"uri":"Nguru%2C_Nigeria","surface_form":"Nguru","offset":191},{"uri":"Hadejia-Nguru_wetlands","surface_form":"Hadejia-Nguru wetlands","offset":342},{"uri":"Nguru_Lake","surface_form":"Nguru Lake","offset":399},{"uri":"Tiga_Dam","surface_form":"Tiga","offset":458},{"uri":"Challawa_Gorge_Dam","surface_form":"Challawa Gorge","offset":467},{"uri":"Kano_State","surface_form":"Kano State","offset":490}]}
