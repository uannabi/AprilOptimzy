It aims to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas. It is involved in the building of the Hyperloop in Los Angeles.\nElon Musk complained via Twitter about Los Angeles traffic and the same day, December 17, 2016, founded the company. It built a short test tunnel in Los Angeles.\nTo raise money for the expensive project, Elon Musk started selling merchandise - first caps and then flamethrowers (branded as 'Not a flamethrower' to thwart customs) and then fire extinguishers to go with. The company website is written in a lighthearted tone, for example describing the fire extinguishers as 'overpriced'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tunnel","surface_form":"tunnel","offset":24},{"uri":"SpaceX","surface_form":"SpaceX","offset":88},{"uri":"Traffic_congestion","surface_form":"traffic congestion","offset":114}]}
