{"id":62010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Jimmu","text":"was the 1st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Jimmu is known as the founder of the Imperial dynasty.\nThere are no certain dates for this emperor's life or reign. The names and sequence of the early emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nJimmu is almost certainly a legend. His name and genealogy are recorded in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\". Jimmu is regarded as a direct descendant of the Shinto sun goddess, Amaterasu.\nDuring reign of Emperor Jimmu, the capital of Japan was at Kashiwabara, Yamato at the foot of Mt. Unebi.\nEvents of Jimmu's life.\nThe absence of information about Jimmu does not mean that he did or did not exist. There is very little data about the rulers of Japan before the reign of Emperor Bidatsu\nThe traditional story is that Jimmu came from Kyushu to Yamato Province on the island of Honshu. The story explains that he followed a three legged crow. He established his reign at Kashihara near Osaka.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jimmu.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") in Kashihara at Nara. The mausoleum is located a short distance from Kashihara Shrine.\nNational holiday.\nIn 1872, the Meiji government declared that February 11, 660 BC was the exact date on which the reign of Jimmu began. This was identified as the start of the Japanese nation. This mythical date was commemorated as the holiday \"Kigensetsu\" (\"Era Day\"). This national holiday was celebrated from 1872 to 1948.\nThe \"Kigensetsu\" events in 1940 were special. They celebrated what was believed to be 2,600 years since the start of Emperor Jimmu's reign.\nThere has been a similar Japanese national holiday since February 11, 1966. It is called National Foundation Day (\"Kenkoku Kinen no hi\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":12},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":23},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":47},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"Imperial dynasty","offset":117},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":148},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":189},{"uri":"Sequence","surface_form":"sequence","offset":210},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":250},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":296},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":328},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":343},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":408},{"uri":"Genealogy","surface_form":"genealogy","offset":429},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":460},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":473},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":534},{"uri":"Amaterasu","surface_form":"Amaterasu","offset":554},{"uri":"Capital_of_Japan","surface_form":"capital of Japan","offset":600},{"uri":"Kashihara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Kashiwabara, Yamato","offset":624},{"uri":"Mt._Unebi","surface_form":"Mt.
