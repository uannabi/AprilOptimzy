The tract starts from the optic chiasma, which receives the optic nerves from the eyes.\nThere are two individual tracts, the left optic tract and the right optic tract. Each passes visual information only from \"the other side of the visual field\".\nEach of these tracts develops from retinal fibers from each eye that corresponds to one half of the visual field.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Visual_system","surface_form":"visual system","offset":33},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":54},{"uri":"Optic_chiasma","surface_form":"optic chiasma","offset":87},{"uri":"Optic_nerve","surface_form":"optic nerve","offset":121},{"uri":"Visual_field","surface_form":"visual field","offset":294},{"uri":"Retina","surface_form":"retinal fiber","offset":344}]}
