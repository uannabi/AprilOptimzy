{"id":62012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumous_name","text":"e=\"preserve\">A posthumous name is an honorary name given to someone after their death. This type of name was common with naming royalty in the countries of Japan and China. They were also sometimes used in Vietnam and Korea.\nHistory.\nThis idea was created during the Zhou Dynasty in China. The first person to be named in this way was Ji Chang, named by his son. His son, Ji Fa of Zhou, called his father the \"Civil King\". This meant that he found his father to be good and sympathetic to the people he ruled.\nThese sort of names were not used during the Qin Dynasty. During that time, these names were not thought to show respect. Posthumous names were used again during the Han Dynasty.\nChinese emperors.\nChinese posthumous names, for rulers, end in one or both symbols for \"emperor\", \"Hu\u00E1ngd\u00EC\". This can be shortened to \"D\u00EC\".\nJapanese emperors.\nThe posthumous names of Japanese emperors are called \"teig\u014D\". Some names are given a long time after their death. Others are given right after the emperor had died.\nSome of these names tell about the place they were born or lived in, or traits they had that their people admired.\nSome also put together two previous emperors' or empresses' names, like Empress Meish\u014D. The empresses before her were called Gemmei and Gensh\u014D. So her name became Meish\u014D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Honor","surface_form":"honor","offset":37},{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":46},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":80},{"uri":"Name","surface_form":"name","offset":100},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":156},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":166},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":206},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":218},{"uri":"Zhou_Dynasty","surface_form":"Zhou Dynasty","offset":267},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":283},{"uri":"Ji_Chang","surface_form":"Ji Chang","offset":335},{"uri":"Ji_Fa","surface_form":"Ji Fa","offset":372},{"uri":"Zhou_Dynasty","surface_form":"Zhou","offset":381},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":416},{"uri":"Sympathy","surface_form":"sympathetic","offset":474},{"uri":"Qin_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qin Dynasty","offset":555},{"uri":"Respect","surface_form":"respect","offset":623},{"uri":"Han_Dynasty","surface_form":"Han Dynasty","offset":676},{"uri":"Chinese_character","surface_form":"symbols","offset":764},{"uri":"Japanese_emperors","surface_form":"Japanese emperors","offset":872},{"uri":"Place","surface_form":"place","offset":1048},{"uri":"Trait","surface_form":"trait","offset":1085},{"uri":"Admiration","surface_form":"admired","offset":1119},{"uri":"Empress_Meish%C5%8D","surface_form":"Empress Meish\u014D","offset":1200},{"uri":"Empress_Gemmei","surface_form":"Gemmei","offset":1253},{"uri":"Empress_Gensh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gensh\u014D","offset":1264}]}
