{"id":620275,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_pizza","text":"The history of pizza begins when different ancient cultures produced flatbread with toppings. Toppings are food added to pizza, like pepperoni, cheese or sausage. Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. The food that came before pizza was probably focaccia (a flatbread to which toppings were added). The word \"pizza\" was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta, Italy. The word came later in parts of Central and Southern Italy.\nThe innovation that led to flatbread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous.\nModern pizza was developed in Naples, Italy, when tomato was added to focaccia in the late 18th century. Pizza, though, was mainly eaten \"in\" the country of Italy.\nBy the late 18th century, it was common for the poor in and around Naples to add the tomato to their yeast-based flatbread. That's when pizza began.\nPizzas need to be baked at temperatures of 200250\u00A0\u00B0C. Not many household ovens could reach such temperatures before the late 1800s. Because of this, pizza was made at home, and then given to the town bakery to bake.\nIn June 1889, Raffaele Esposito, a chef from Naples, created the \"Margherita\" in honour of Queen Margherita. It was the first pizza to include cheese. Most pizzas include cheese as a topping.\nPizza first made its appearance to the United States in the 19th century when Italian immigrants came to the country. It was very popular with Italian people in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and St. Louis.\nAllied troops in Italy came to enjoy pizza and other Italian foods during World War II.\nThe first printed reference to the word \"pizza\" in the U.S. was in 1904 in \"The Boston Journal\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flatbread","surface_form":"flatbread","offset":69},{"uri":"Pepperoni","surface_form":"pepperoni","offset":133},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":144},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"sausage","offset":154},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":211},{"uri":"Pizza","surface_form":"pizza","offset":252},{"uri":"Flatbread","surface_form":"flatbread","offset":283},{"uri":"Gaeta","surface_form":"Gaeta","offset":375},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":382},{"uri":"Innovation","surface_form":"innovation","offset":453},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":574},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":590},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":660},{"uri":"Naples","surface_form":"Naples","offset":701},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":721},{"uri":"Bakery","surface_form":"bakery","offset":1184},{"uri":"Naples","surface_form":"Naples","offset":1245},{"uri":"Margherita_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Queen Margherita","offset":1291},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1431},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1553},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":1568},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":1577},{"uri":"St._Louis","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":1594},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allied","offset":1605},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1679},{"uri":"The_Boston_Journal","surface_form":"The Boston Journal","offset":1769}]}
