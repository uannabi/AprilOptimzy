It was led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi after the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. It aimed to resist British rule in India through non-violent means or \"satyagraha\". Protestors would refuse to buy British goods, adopt nihal use of local handicrafts and picket and liquor shops. The ideas of Ahimsa and nonviolence, and Gandhi's ability to rally hundreds of thousands of common citizens towards the cause of Indian independence, were first seen on a large scale in this movement through the summer 1920. Gandhi feared that the movement might lead to popular violence. The non-cooperation movement was launched on 5th September, 1920.\nIt was called off in February 1922 when a group of peasants lit fire to police station in chauri chaura located in Uttar Pradesh","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Indian_independence_movement","surface_form":"Indian independence movement","offset":72},{"uri":"Mahatma_Gandhi","surface_form":"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi","offset":138},{"uri":"Jallianwala_Bagh_Massacre","surface_form":"Jallianwala Bagh Massacre","offset":175},{"uri":"Ahimsa","surface_form":"Ahimsa","offset":411},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":677}]}
