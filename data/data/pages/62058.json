He is voiced by co-creator Trey Parker.\nCartman is one of four main characters in the series. He is often the main reason for their adventures because of his over-enthusiasm and selfishness. Cartman often reacts violently to things that he hates. He hates any race or group of which he is not a member, particularly the Jews. This comes from his rivalry with Kyle Broflovski. Eric idolizes Adolf Hitler, Henry Ford, and Mel Gibson. He is also a fan of T.S. Elliot. He often tricks others, at which he is good at, to meet his own ends, no matter the consequences to other people, even if it can result in deaths.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":27},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":54},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":63},{"uri":"South_Park","surface_form":"South Park","offset":82},{"uri":"Trey_Parker","surface_form":"Trey Parker","offset":122},{"uri":"Enthusiasm","surface_form":"over-enthusiasm","offset":253},{"uri":"Selfish","surface_form":"selfishness","offset":273},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":355},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":415},{"uri":"Kyle_Broflovski","surface_form":"Kyle Broflovski","offset":454},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":485},{"uri":"Henry_Ford","surface_form":"Henry Ford","offset":499},{"uri":"Mel_Gibson","surface_form":"Mel Gibson","offset":515},{"uri":"T.S._Elliot","surface_form":"T.S.
