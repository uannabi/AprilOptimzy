Two examples of algebraic fractions are formula_1 and formula_1.\nA rational fraction is an algebraic fraction where the top and the bottom are polynomials. formula_1 is a rational fraction, but formula_1 is not. This is because the top has a square root function.\nMultiplication.\nformula_1\nformula_1\nformula_1\nDivision.\nTurn the equation into multiplication by flipping one of the fractions. After that, do what is shown above.\nformula_1","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fraction","offset":40},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebraic expressions","offset":82},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":248},{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":347},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":359}]}
