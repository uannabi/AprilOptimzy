She started competing in ski races three years before the 2018 Games. Her sister is Chlo\u00E9 Sana. She is El\u00E9onor's guide skier. They use a microphone and a headset in their helmets to talk to each other. El\u00E9onor and her older sister won two medals at the 2017 World Championships. One was a silver and the other was a bronze. It costs them a lot of money to participate in ski races. There is not much sponsorship in Belgium. Chlo\u00E9 said this can make it very difficult to compete in races. Before the 2018 Games, Chlo\u00E9 wanted to win a medal. At the same time, she was happy just to be going to Pyeongchang.\nMarine Antoine went with the Sana sisters to South Korea. She was a reserve guide in case an accident or injury happened to Chloe.\nJasper Balcaen finished twenty-ninth at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. He wanted to do better than that in South Korea. His goal was to finish in the top ten.

The road to this selection was not always easy and would have been impossible without my family and my 2 trainers Gustav &\u00A0 \u00A0 Mark Scorgie. The selection is the result of Teamwork. I hope this shows that no dream is impossible as long as you keep believing in it! \" He trains in Stubaital, Austria.
