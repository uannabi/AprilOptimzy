There will be at least one person competing in para-snowboarding.\nTeam.\nThe table below contains the list of members of people (called \"Team Denmark\") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.\nBackground.\nIn autumn of 2017, responsibility for sending a team to the Paralympics was changed from Parasport Denmark, the National Paralympic Committee of Denmark, to National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark (DIF). The decision was made because people wanted to make Olympic and Paralympic sport more equal. Niels Christiansen, secretary general of Parasport Denmark, said, \"We are very happy with the move, and we look forward to working together with DIF. The Paralympics and the development and preparation of world class Para-athletes is still very much a focal point of our work in Parasport Denmark, but allowing DIF to take the reigns sends an important message and hopefully it will lead to even more Paralympic success for Denmark.\" Despite this change, Parasport Denmark was still in charge of preparing to send a team to the Winter Paralympic Games.\nHistory.\nDenmark first went to the Winter Paralympics in 1980 in Geilo.\u00A0 Before South Korea, they had won a total of two gold medals, one silver medal and three bronze medals at the Winter Games.

The last time the country won a medal at the 1994 Winter Paralympics.
