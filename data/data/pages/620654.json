Corruption in the Czech Republic involving subsidies for sport resulted in the national team getting less money to support their training and ability to compete in tournaments. FA\u010CR Chairman Miroslav Pelta was arrested as part of the corruption issues. About the corruption, team captain Zden\u011Bk \u0160afr\u00E1nek said, \"The subsidy scandal has radically reduced the amount we receive. For the sake of illustration, the Czech Paralympic Committee has now gotten less money than last year's sledge hockey players, and it has to be divided into a lot of sports.\" The team could not buy time to use ice at skating rinks to train much before their final qualifying competition in Sweden. They also could not buy new equipment like sledges, hockey sticks or hockey gloves. To make sure they were ready to qualify, the captain thought the team needed around 1 million Czech Koruna () to pay for all the costs of training and traveling. Because they could not get funding from the government, players had to ask individuals to support them financially.\nThe team went to Nagano to compete in a tournament in February 2018 to prepare for the Games.\nQualification.\nJapan, Sweden and the Czech Republic were the last 3 teams that were able to go to the 2018 Games. They could go because of how they finished at the Qualification Tournament in October in Ostersund, Sweden in October 2017. Teams participating in the tournament included Sweden, Germany, Slovakia, Japan and Great Britain.\nSchedule and results.\nThe United States, South Korea, the Czech Republic and Japan were in Group B for the sledge hockey competition.

The Czech Republic plays Japan on 13 March.\nMedia coverage.\nSome of the Paralympics would be broad on television by \u010CT TV and \u010CT Sport.
