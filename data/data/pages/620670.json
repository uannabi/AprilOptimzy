People will compete in cross-country skiing, para-alpine skiing, biathlon and para-snowboarding. Team members include Katarzyna Rogowiec and Igor Sikorski.\nTeam.\nIn January 2018, Poland thought their team for the 2018 Games would include ten sportspeople in four sports: cross-country skiing, para-alpine skiing, biathlon and para-snowboarding. The complete list of all members of Team Poland was shared in February 2018.\nThe table below contains the list of members of people (called \"Team Poland\") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.\nIt can be difficult for people with disabilities to participate in winter sports. Katarzyna Rogowiec said the reason is because people are more dependent on others. They need help to put on jackets. They may need help to get into a special chair. It can be difficult to stay warm when you do not have hands. Winter sports are also very expensive. The cost makes it difficult for many people to participate.\nGoals.\nPoland did not win any medals at the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Poland won a bronze medal at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Polish Paralympic Committee President \u0141ukasz Szeliga said the goal of Poland is to have better finishes than 2010 and 2014. They would like to win at least one medal.\nSkiers.\nThe team includes Igor Sikorski. Sikorski is from Krakow.\nBefore the Games.\nIn January 2018, Igor Sikorski went to the World Cup in Zagreb, Croatia. He skied really well at the competition.\nSchedule and results.\nThe first event on the para-alpine program is the downhill. It starts on 10 March. People ski from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM.
