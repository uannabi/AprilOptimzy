{"id":620673,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_at_the_2018_Winter_Paralympics","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Norway sent people to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. People are competing in para-alpine skiing, para-Nordic skiing, para-snowboarding, sledge hockey and wheelchair curling.\nTeam.\nThe table below contains the list of members of people (called \"Team Norway\") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.\nOwe L\u00FCthcke is a sledge hockey referee. The Norwegian went to Pyeongchang to referee matches. He was part of the official Norwegian delegation.\nHistory.\nAt the 2014 Winter Paralympics, there were 31 people from Norway competing. There were 25 men and 6 women.\u00A0 They won 1 gold medal, 2 silver medals and 1 bronze medal.\nGoals.\nFor the 2018 Winter Paralympics, Nord-Tr\u00F8ndelag County Council has some goals. These included getting more people to compete in disability sports. They also wanted to increase the level of accessibility to sports buildings and sports field in Nord-Tr\u00F8ndelag County and the rest of Norway.\nDoping.\nIn December 2017, Norway said it would not send any anti-doping officials to the Winter Olympics or Paralympics. They are tired of needing to use unpaid volunteers. They think anti-doping officials need to be paid. Anti-doping Norway chief executive Anders Solheim said, \"If you sell TV rights for this arrangement for billions of dollars, then we think it's wrong that we pay for Norwegian doping controllers to help with the controls. An inspector should receive a reasonable salary and his trip paid for the three weeks he or she will be there. By not paying doping controllers, the organisers are \"de facto\" relying on volunteers. Anti-doping work should not be a voluntary profession for those who want to. It is downplaying the priority of our work, and we are tired of it.\"\nSkiers.\nBirgit Skarstein competes in two sports: adapted rowing and para-Nordic skiing.\u00A0 She won a gold medal at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in the PR1 W1x.\u00A0 Skarstein also went to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and she finished fourth.\u00A0 Skarstein has also went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics, competing in para-Nordic skiing.\nSchedule and results.\nOn 12 March, the 15\u00A0km race takes place, with standing and vision impaired women starting at 10:00 PM.
