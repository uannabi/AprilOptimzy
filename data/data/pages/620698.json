{"id":620698,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator","text":"=\"preserve\">The lowest common denominator (also least common denominator and LCD) is the least common multiple of the denominators (bottom parts) of a group of fractions. It makes it easier to add, subtract, and compare fractions.\nThe LCD of formula_1 and formula_1 is 6. This is because formula_1 and formula_1 equal formula_1 and formula_1. 6 is the smallest number that can be at the bottom of both of those fractions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Least_common_multiple","surface_form":"least common multiple","offset":89},{"uri":"Denominator","surface_form":"denominator","offset":118},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":"fraction","offset":160}]}
