When the Trump campaign announced that the rally would not take place, there was a great deal of shouting and a few small fights between Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters.\nTrump blamed Senator Bernie Sanders Sanders for the clashes in Chicago. He said that the protesters were \"Bernie's crowd\" and that a protester who charged the stage at an event in Dayton, Ohio the following day was a \"Bernie person\", calling on Sanders to \"get your people in line.\" Sanders later called out Trump as a \"pathological liar\" who leads a \"vicious movement\", and said that \"while I appreciate that we had supporters at Trump's rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign%2C_2016","surface_form":"Donald Trump presidential campaign","offset":23},{"uri":"University_of_Illinois_at_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Illinois at Chicago","offset":91},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":135},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":144},{"uri":"UIC_Pavilion","surface_form":"UIC Pavilion","offset":458},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":709},{"uri":"Dayton%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Dayton, Ohio","offset":868}]}
