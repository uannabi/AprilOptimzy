{"id":62096,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urartu","text":"=\"preserve\">Urartu (Assyrian \"Urar\u1E6Du\", Urartian \"Biainili\") was an ancient kingdom in Armenia. It was in the mountainous plateau between Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Caucasus mountains, later known as the Armenian Highland, and it centered around Lake Van (present-day eastern Turkey). The kingdom existed from ca. 860 BC, emerging from Late Bronze Age Nairi polities, until 585 BC. The name corresponds to the Biblical Ararat.\nUrartu extended from Lake Van southeastward to Mannai, and sometimes even included that land as one of its provinces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urartian_language","surface_form":"Urartian","offset":39},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":86},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":137},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Mesopotamia","offset":149},{"uri":"Caucasus_mountains","surface_form":"Caucasus mountains","offset":166},{"uri":"Armenian_Highland","surface_form":"Armenian Highland","offset":205},{"uri":"Lake_Van","surface_form":"Lake Van","offset":247},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":277},{"uri":"860s_BC","surface_form":"860 BC","offset":315},{"uri":"Nairi","surface_form":"Nairi","offset":353},{"uri":"585_BC","surface_form":"585 BC","offset":375},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Biblical","offset":411},{"uri":"Mount_Ararat","surface_form":"Ararat","offset":420},{"uri":"Lake_Van","surface_form":"Lake Van","offset":449}]}
