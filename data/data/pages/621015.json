It currently employs more than 2,400 people. Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Union Carbide was 50.9% stakeholder in Union Carbide India Limited, the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster.\nFounded in 1917 as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company's researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dow_Chemical","surface_form":"Dow Chemical Company","offset":71},{"uri":"Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","surface_form":"Dow Jones Industrial Average","offset":590},{"uri":"Union_Carbide_India_Limited","surface_form":"Union Carbide India Limited","offset":659},{"uri":"Bhopal_disaster","surface_form":"Bhopal disaster","offset":720},{"uri":"National_Carbon_Company","surface_form":"National Carbon Company","offset":817},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":856},{"uri":"Ethylene","surface_form":"ethylene","offset":904},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":918},{"uri":"Ethane","surface_form":"ethane","offset":947},{"uri":"Propane","surface_form":"propane","offset":958},{"uri":"Petrochemical_industry","surface_form":"petrochemical industry","offset":994},{"uri":"Eveready_Battery_Company","surface_form":"Eveready","offset":1084},{"uri":"Energizer_Holdings","surface_form":"Energizer","offset":1097},{"uri":"Glad_(company)","surface_form":"Glad","offset":1118},{"uri":"Simoniz","surface_form":"Simoniz","offset":1139},{"uri":"Prestone","surface_form":"Prestone","offset":1160},{"uri":"Antifreeze","surface_form":"antifreeze","offset":1169},{"uri":"Polyurethane","surface_form":"polyurethane","offset":1310}]}
