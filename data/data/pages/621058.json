{"id":621058,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy","text":"Falcon Heavy is a reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and made by SpaceX. It is inspired from the Falcon 9 vehicle. This increases the low Earth orbit (LEO) maximum payload to, compared to for a Falcon 9 Full Thrust, for Delta IV Heavy, for the Space Shuttle and for Saturn V. Falcon Heavy is the world's fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built, after Saturn V, Energia and N1, and the most powerful rocket in operation as of 2020.\nSpaceX conducted Falcon Heavy's first launch on February 6, 2018, at 3:45\u00A0p.m. EST (20:45 UTC). The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk as a dummy payload into a path around the sun. The first commercial launch was on 11 April 2019, for Arabsat. It was a success.\nFalcon Heavy was designed to carry humans into space, for example to the Moon and Mars, although as of February 2018, it is not certified and there are no plans to use it for crewed missions. It will instead be devoted to launching large satellites or space probes.\nOther websites.\n[https://spacex.com/falcon-heavy SpaceX's Falcon Heavy overview page]","categories":[],"infobox_types":["rocket/payload","rocket/payload","rocket/payload","rocket/payload","rocket/stage","rocket/stage","rocket/stage"],"annotations":[{"uri":"SpaceX","surface_form":"SpaceX","offset":74},{"uri":"Falcon_9","surface_form":"Falcon 9","offset":106},{"uri":"Low_Earth_orbit","surface_form":"low Earth orbit","offset":143},{"uri":"Falcon_9","surface_form":"Falcon 9","offset":203},{"uri":"Delta_IV","surface_form":"Delta IV Heavy","offset":229},{"uri":"Space_Shuttle","surface_form":"Space Shuttle","offset":253},{"uri":"Saturn_V","surface_form":"Saturn V","offset":275},{"uri":"Energia","surface_form":"Energia","offset":372},{"uri":"N1_(rocket)","surface_form":"N1","offset":384},{"uri":"Eastern_Time_Zone","surface_form":"EST","offset":521},{"uri":"Tesla_Roadster","surface_form":"Tesla Roadster","offset":559},{"uri":"Elon_Musk","surface_form":"Elon Musk","offset":602},{"uri":"Arab_Satellite_Communications_Organization","surface_form":"Arabsat","offset":713},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":813},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":822}]}
