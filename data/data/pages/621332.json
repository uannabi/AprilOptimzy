{"id":621332,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand","text":"=\"preserve\">In math, an operand is a number being worked on in an equation. In 1 + 2 = 3, 1 and 2 are operands. (1 + 2) together is also an operand.\nNotation.\nIn (3 + 5) \u00D7 2, (3 + 5) and 2 are the operands. (3 + 5) has operands that are separate: 3 and 5.\nThere are three ways to set operands: 1 + 2, + 1 2, and 1 2 +. The first of those is used the most.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Math","surface_form":"math","offset":15},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":66}]}
