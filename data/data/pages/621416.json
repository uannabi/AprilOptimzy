Four countries gone to their first Winter Paralympics. They are Pakistan, Georgia, North Korea and Tajikstan.\nJust like at the Olympics which happened the month before, there are no athletes from Russia taking part in the Paralympics under their country's name because the IOC found out many of them had been doping. Those who were not caught could compete as an \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\".\nSports.\nSix sports were at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. Between them, they will award 80 medals. Unlike the 2014 Winter Paralympics, para-snowboarding is not included with para-alpine skiing at the 2018 Games. The sport is giving 10 medals in 2018. In 2014, it only gave 2.
