When he was a young man he trained with the artist Giovanni Carnovali. He lived in Venice from 1852 to 1859. Then he moved to Milan. In Milan he became part of the Scapigliatura movement. Cremona died in Milan from a sudden intestinal blockage. The illness was caused by poisoning from the oil paints which he made himself. He tested them by spreading them on the bare skin of his arms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":57},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portrait","offset":92},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":123},{"uri":"Marco_Polo","surface_form":"Marco Polo","offset":152},{"uri":"Kubla_Khan","surface_form":"Kubla Khan","offset":179},{"uri":"Pavia","surface_form":"Pavia","offset":223},{"uri":"Giovanni_Carnovali","surface_form":"Giovanni Carnovali","offset":281},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":356},{"uri":"Scapigliatura","surface_form":"Scapigliatura","offset":394},{"uri":"Intestinal_blockage","surface_form":"intestinal blockage","offset":454},{"uri":"Oil_paint","surface_form":"oil paint","offset":520}]}
