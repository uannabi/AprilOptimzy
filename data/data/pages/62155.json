Historians consider Emperor Suizei to be a legendary person, and the name Suizei\"-tenn\u014D\" was created for him after his death by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that Suizei ruled from the palace of \"Takaoka-no-miya\" at Katsuragi in what will come to be known as Yamato province.\nTraditional history.\nSuizei is almost certainly a legend. The \"Kojiki\" records only his name and genealogy. The \"Nihonshoki\" includes Suizei as the earliest or first of.\nThe \"Gukansh\u014D\" records that Suizei was one of the sons of Emperor Jimmu.\nDuring reign of Emperor Suizei, the capital of Japan was at Kazuraki, Yamato.\nEvents of Suizei's life.\nThe Kojiki includes a story about how Suizei attained the throne. His older brother supported Suizei because of his courage.\nThe absence of information about Suizei does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei (509?-571).\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Suizei.\nThe actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"emperor","offset":12},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":23},{"uri":"List_of_Emperors_of_Japan","surface_form":"traditional order of succession","offset":47},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":123},{"uri":"Created","surface_form":"created","offset":173},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"after his death","offset":189},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":214},{"uri":"Certain","surface_form":"certain","offset":230},{"uri":"Assign","surface_form":"assigned","offset":251},{"uri":"Reign","surface_form":"reign","offset":286},{"uri":"Convention","surface_form":"conventionally","offset":297},{"uri":"Confirm","surface_form":"confirmed","offset":377},{"uri":"Emperor_Kammu","surface_form":"Emperor Kammu","offset":423},{"uri":"Monarch","surface_form":"monarch","offset":455},{"uri":"Yamato_dynasty","surface_form":"Yamato dynasty","offset":470},{"uri":"Gukansh%C5%8D","surface_form":"Gukansh\u014D","offset":491},{"uri":"Yamato_province","surface_form":"Yamato province","offset":610},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":677},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":690},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":740},{"uri":"Emperor_Jimmu","surface_form":"Emperor Jimmu","offset":855},{"uri":"Capital_of_Japan","surface_form":"capital of Japan","offset":906},{"uri":"Kazuraki%2C_Yamato","surface_form":"Kazuraki, Yamato","offset":930},{"uri":"Attained","surface_form":"attained","offset":1018},{"uri":"Emperor_Kimmei","surface_form":"Emperor Kimmei","offset":1274},{"uri":"Posthumous_name","surface_form":"posthumous name","offset":1368},{"uri":"Regularize","surface_form":"regularized","offset":1389},{"uri":"Ascribe","surface_form":"ascribed","offset":1445},{"uri":"Site","surface_form":"site","offset":1476},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":1488},{"uri":"Imperial_Household_Agency","surface_form":"Imperial Household Agency","offset":1525},{"uri":"Venerate","surface_form":"venerated","offset":1568},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":1583},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":1592},{"uri":"Shrine","surface_form":"shrine","offset":1599},{"uri":"Nara%2C_Nara","surface_form":"Nara","offset":1622}]}
