{"id":62168,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria","text":"Pretoria is one of the three capital cities of the African country of South Africa. It is the executive (administrative) and de facto capital of the country. The other two capitals are Cape Town (legislative) and Bloemfontein (judicial). The city is in the northern part of Gauteng Province, South Africa.\nGeography and climate.\nPretoria is between the Highveld and the Bushveld, about 50 km north of Johannesburg in the north-east of South Africa. It is in a warm, well sheltered valley. The valley is surrounded by the hills of the Magaliesberg mountain range. Pretoria has a humid subtropical climate (Cwa in the Koeppen climate classification). Snow is a very rare event. It only snows in Pretoria once or twice in a century.\nDemographics.\nThe city has a population of about 1.9 million people. The main languages spoken in Pretoria include Tswana, Ndebele, Afrikaans, and English.\nHistory.\nNguni-speaking settlers were probably the first people to live in the river valley that later became the location of the city of Pretoria.\nPretoria was founded in 1855 by Marthinus Wessel Pretorius. He was a leader of the Voortrekkers. Pretoruis named the city after his father Andries Pretorius. Andries Pretorius had become a hero of the Voortrekkers after the Battle of Blood River. The city became the capital of the South African Republic (ZAR) on May 1, 1860.\nDuring the First Boer War, the city was attacked in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty which ended the war was signed in Pretoria on August 3, 1881 at the Pretoria Convention.\nThe Second Boer War (1899 to 1902) caused the end of the South African Republic. After this war, the United Kingdom took control of South Africa. During the war, Winston Churchill was imprisoned in the Staats Model School in Pretoria. He later got free and went to Mozambique. The city surrendered to British forces on June 5, 1900. The war ended in Pretoria with the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging on May 31 1902.\nIn 1910, Pretoria then became the administrative capital of all of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal. On 14 October 1931, Pretoria got official city status. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria stayed its administrative capital.\nPretoria was at one time seen as \"the capital of Apartheid South Africa\". This was changed when Nelson Mandela became the country's first black President.\nEconomy.\nPretoria is an important industrial centre. It has many industries including iron and steel as well as automobile, railroad and machinery manufacture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital
