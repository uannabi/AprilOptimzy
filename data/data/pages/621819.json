{"id":621819,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istituto_Centrale_per_il_Catalogo_Unico","text":"e=\"preserve\">Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico or ICCU (in English Central Institute for the Union Catalogue of Italian Libraries and for Bibliographic Information'\") is an Italian government agency. It manages the network and online catalog of the Italian National Library Service (\"Servizio bibliotecario nazionale\" or SBN). It also manages Internet Culturale, an online collection of digitized documents and pictures held in Italian libraries. The ICCU publishes books and reports on library science in Italy and organizes conferences on library science. ICCU numbers serve as authority controls. As of February 2012, the ICCU had authority controls for the names of over 43,000 people.\nThe ICCU was officially created in 1975. Its first director was Angela Vinay (1922\u20131990). The ICCU replaced the Centro nazionale per il catalogo unico (National Single Directory Center). That organization was founded in 1951 to start building a single catalog for all of Italy's libraries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government_agency","surface_form":"government agency","offset":187},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":221},{"uri":"Catalog","surface_form":"catalog","offset":240},{"uri":"Digitize","surface_form":"digitized","offset":393},{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"document","offset":403},{"uri":"Authority_control","surface_form":"authority controls","offset":586}]}
