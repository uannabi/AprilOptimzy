{"id":621847,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para-Nordic_skiing","text":"e=\"preserve\">Para-Nordic skiing is a type of skiing for people with disabilities. It includes two sports. They are cross country skiing and biathlon. Both sports are for blind people and people with physical disabilities.\nBiathlon.\nBiathlon uses the same rules created by the International Biathlon Association (IBU). Some changes have been made to the rules by the International Paralympic Nordic Skiing Committee (IPNNC).\nBiathlon is two sports combined. These sports are shooting and cross country skiing. Biathlon has several types of races. They are 7.5 km, 12.5 km, and pursuit. During the race, people shoot their guns two to four times. Each time they shoot, they take five shots. Depending on the competition, there are two different consequences for missing. They may get a points penalty. They may have to ski a penalty distance.\nBlind people and people with physical disabilities compete in the biathlon. People with physical disabilities are separated into two groups. These are standing skiers and sitting skiers.\nBlind people use a special electro-acoustic firing system. Their helmets have a wireless connection with their weapons. Using their headphones, they can locate the target. The closer their weapon is aimed at the target, the louder the sound.\nCross country skiing.\nThe rules for cross country skiing are similar to the ones created by International Ski Federation (FIS). They have been modified by the International Para Nordic Skiing Committee (IPNNC). Blind people and people with physical disabilities compete in cross country skiing. People with physical disabilities are separated into two groups. These are standing skiers and sitting skiers. People with physical disabilities who ski while standing are classified from LW2 to LW9. People with physical disabilities who use a sit ski are classified from LW10 to LW12. People who are blind are classified from B1 to B3. People who are blind use a guide skier. Guide skiers tell a blind skier which direction to ski.\nBecause people with different types of disabilities ski against each other, a system has been created to make the results more fair. The person with the best time does not always win. Instead, the finishing time is multiplied against a percentage. The percentage is based on how difficult a person's disability makes it to ski. The time multiplied by the percentages gives a new time result. This new time is used to determine who wins a race.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Acoustic","surface_form":"electro-acoustic","offset":1055},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"firing system","offset":1072},{"uri":"Target","surface_form":"target","offset":1192},{"uri":"Sit-ski","surface_form":"sit ski","offset":1809},{"uri":"Guide_skier","surface_form":"guide skier","offset":1929}]}
