{"id":62186,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope","text":"An oscilloscope (sometimes abbreviated CRO, for cathode ray oscilloscope, or commonly just scope or O-scope) is a piece of electronic equipment that lets you see changes in signal voltage. For example, if you want to see the signal a small electronic timer was producing, you could connect it to an oscilloscope and see.\nUsually, it shows a two-dimensional graph of one or more electrical potential differences (vertical axis). These graphs are plotted with time or of some other voltage along horizontal axis.\nDescription.\nA typical oscilloscope is usually box shaped with a display screen, numerous input connectors, control knobs and buttons on the front panel.\nTo aid measurement, a grid called the \"graticule\" is drawn on the face of the screen. Each square in the graticule is known as a \"division\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cathode_ray","surface_form":"cathode ray","offset":48},{"uri":"Potential_difference","surface_form":"potential difference","offset":389}]}
