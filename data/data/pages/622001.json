{"id":622001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_y_Fan","text":"Pen y Fan () is the highest peak in South Wales, situated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. At above sea-level, it is also the highest British peak south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia. The twin summits of Pen y Fan and Corn Du at were formerly referred to as Cadair Arthur or 'Arthur's Seat'.\nThe mountain and surrounding area are owned by the National Trust whose work parties attempt to combat the erosion caused by the passage of thousands of feet up and down this most popular of South Wales' peaks. The mountain is used by the military as part of the selection process of the UK's Special Forces personnel. Three soldiers who died after collapsing in the field in July 2013 were believed to have been climbing the mountain (see \"Fan Dance\") while undergoing Special Air Service selection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Wales","surface_form":"South Wales","offset":36},{"uri":"Brecon_Beacons_National_Park","surface_form":"Brecon Beacons National Park","offset":65},{"uri":"Cadair_Idris","surface_form":"Cadair Idris","offset":160},{"uri":"Snowdonia","surface_form":"Snowdonia","offset":176},{"uri":"Corn_Du","surface_form":"Corn Du","offset":221},{"uri":"National_Trust","surface_form":"National Trust","offset":346},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":402},{"uri":"Ministry_of_Defence_(UK)","surface_form":"military","offset":534},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK's","offset":583},{"uri":"S.A.S.","surface_form":"Special Forces","offset":588},{"uri":"Fan_dance_(exercise)","surface_form":"Fan Dance","offset":736},{"uri":"Special_Air_Service","surface_form":"Special Air Service","offset":765}]}
