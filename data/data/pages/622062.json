{"id":622062,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex","text":"A vertex is a corner. More than one vertex are called vertices. A vertex is a point where two or more lines, curves, rays, or sides meet, and is often represented by letters such as formula_1, formula_1, formula_1 and formula_1.\nFor example, the vertex of an angle is the point where the two edges of the angle intersect, and a vertex of a cube is simply one of its corners\u2014of which there are 8.\nThe concept of vertex applies to both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometrical objects. For example, a tetrahedron has 4 vertices, and a pentagon has 5 vertices.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":102},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":109},{"uri":"Ray","surface_form":"ray","offset":117},{"uri":"Side","surface_form":"side","offset":126},{"uri":"Tetrahedron","surface_form":"tetrahedron","offset":508},{"uri":"Pentagon","surface_form":"pentagon","offset":542}]}
