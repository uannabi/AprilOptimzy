The pieces of meat used for steaks are usually cut across the muscle fiber, not along it. This makes them appear more tender.\nA restaurant that mainly makes steaks is known as a steakhouse. A well-known side dish to steak is prawns or a cooked lobster tail. This combination is often called \"surf and turf\" or \"reef and beef\" (the words \"surf\" and \"reef\" refer to the seafood and \"turf\" and \"beef\" refer to the steak).

Other common side dishes are baked potatoes, dinner rolls, salad, and corn on the cob. In France, steaks are often served with french fries.
