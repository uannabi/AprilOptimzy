Each corner is 147.27\u00B0. All corners added together equal 6840\u00B0.\nArea.\nThe amount of space a regular nonagon takes up is\n\"a\" is the length of one of its sides.\nTilings.\nThe regular enneagon can tessellate the euclidean tiling with gaps. These gaps can be filled with regular hexagons and isosceles triangles. In the notation of symmetrohedron this tiling is called H(*;3;*;[2]) with H representing *632 hexagonal symmetry in the plane.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"shape","offset":24},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"corner","offset":49},{"uri":"Symmetrohedron","surface_form":"symmetrohedron","offset":454}]}
