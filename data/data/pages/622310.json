A 'hexangle', 'star hexagon', or 'hexalpha' means the same thing.\nIt is used in historical, religious and cultural contexts, for example in Hanafism, Judaism, Hinduism and occultism. It is possible that this simple geometric shape, like the triangle, circle, or square, has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.\nGroup theory.\nIn mathematics, the root system for the simple Lie group G2 is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":73},{"uri":"Hanafism","surface_form":"Hanafism","offset":230},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":240},{"uri":"Occultism","surface_form":"occultism","offset":262},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":448},{"uri":"Root_system","surface_form":"root system","offset":465},{"uri":"Lie_group","surface_form":"Lie group","offset":492},{"uri":"G2_(mathematics)","surface_form":"G2","offset":502}]}
