{"id":62253,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient)","text":"=\"preserve\">Heliopolis was one of the oldest cities of Egypt. Its name also refers (in European languages) to a modern suburb of Cairo. The ancient city stood five miles east of the Nile north of the apex of the river delta. The modern city of Heliopolis is in a different place. In ancient times it was the main city of sun-worship.\nThis was also where the Heliopolitan version of Egyptian mythology was created.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":55},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":119},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":129},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":182},{"uri":"River_delta","surface_form":"river delta","offset":212},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":321},{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"Egyptian mythology","offset":382}]}
