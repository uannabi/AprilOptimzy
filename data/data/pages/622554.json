{"id":622554,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency","text":"The cutoff frequency is the minimum frequency that is required for the emission of electrons from a metallic surface, due to incident radiation. Below the cutoff frequency, the phenomenon of the photoelectric effect stops altogether.\nWhen electromagnetic radiation is incident upon a metallic surface, if the radiation has a frequency greater than the threshold frequency, a part of the energy of the incident radiation (known as threshold work function) is absorbed by the electrons on the metallic surface; facilitating electronic excitement. The remaining portion (i.e, energy of incident radiation - threshold work function) is transformed into the kinetic energy of the electrons and accounts for their ejection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":36},{"uri":"Emission","surface_form":"emission","offset":71},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":83},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":177},{"uri":"Photoelectric_effect","surface_form":"photoelectric effect","offset":195}]}
