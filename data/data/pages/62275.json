It is a member of the \"Bartonella\" genus. The bacteria was found by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also helped with the discovery.\nThe bacterium was first found in a 43-year-old American woman. She was in Peru when she became very sick. She had a high fever, anemia and insomnia. The illness was thought to be \"Bartonella bacilliformis\", a similar bacteria that causes Oroya fever. The scientists later discovered that a new species of bacteria had caused the illness. They gave the patient some antibiotics. Her condition later improved.\nThe findings were published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" on June 7, 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gram-negative","surface_form":"gram-negative","offset":59},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":73},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":378},{"uri":"Oroya_fever","surface_form":"Oroya fever","offset":542},{"uri":"Antibiotic","surface_form":"antibiotic","offset":669},{"uri":"New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","surface_form":"New England Journal of Medicine","offset":748}]}
