{"id":622837,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_We_Take_Manhattan","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"First We Take Manhattan\" is a song written by Leonard Cohen. It was originally recorded by Jennifer Warnes on her 1986 Cohen tribute album \"Famous Blue Raincoat\", which consisted entirely of songs written or co-written by Cohen.\nBen Hewitt writing for \"The Guardian\" in 2015 drew attention to the lyric's apocalyptic nature, imagining Cohen \"greedily eyeing world domination like a Bond villain\".\nJoe Cocker covered \"First We Take Manhattan\" on his 1999 album \"No Ordinary World\".\nAn explanation.\nCohen explained himself in a backstage interview: \"I think it means exactly what it says. It is a terrorist song. I think it's a response to terrorism. There's something about terrorism that I've always admired. The fact that there are no alibis or no compromises. That position is always very attractive. I don't like it when it's manifested on the physical plane \u2013 I don't really enjoy the terrorist activities \u2013 but Psychic Terrorism. I remember there was a great poem by Irving Layton that I once read, I'll give you a paraphrase of it. It was 'well, you guys blow up an occasional airline and kill a few children here and there', he says. 'But our terrorists, Jesus, Freud, Marx, Einstein. The whole world is still quaking.'\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Leonard_Cohen","surface_form":"Leonard Cohen","offset":60},{"uri":"Jennifer_Warnes","surface_form":"Jennifer Warnes","offset":105},{"uri":"Famous_Blue_Raincoat_(album)","surface_form":"Famous Blue Raincoat","offset":154},{"uri":"Joe_Cocker","surface_form":"Joe Cocker","offset":411},{"uri":"No_Ordinary_World","surface_form":"No Ordinary World","offset":475},{"uri":"Irving_Layton","surface_form":"Irving Layton","offset":986}]}
