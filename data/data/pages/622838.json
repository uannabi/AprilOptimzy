Political events and history are found elsewhere on the album, with Cohen making references to Tiananmen Square, Stalin, World War II and Hiroshima.\nThe title track was originally called \"If You Could See What's Coming Next\", and underwent extensive rewrites, taking up almost sixty pages in Cohen's notebook, while \"Closing Time\" took two years with Cohen even starting over from scratch on the song as late as March 1992.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":42},{"uri":"Leonard_Cohen","surface_form":"Leonard Cohen","offset":69},{"uri":"Tiananmen_Square","surface_form":"Tiananmen Square","offset":197},{"uri":"Stalin","surface_form":"Stalin","offset":215},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":223},{"uri":"Hiroshima","surface_form":"Hiroshima","offset":240}]}
