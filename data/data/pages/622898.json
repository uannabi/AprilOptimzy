{"id":622898,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecagon","text":"An hexadecagon or hekkaidecagon is a shape with 16 sides and 16 corners.\nRegular hexadecagon.\nA \"regular hexadecagon\" is a hexadecagon in which all angles are equal and all sides are congruent. Its Schl\u00E4fli symbol is and can be constructed as a truncated octagon, t, and a twice-truncated square tt. A truncated hexadecagon, t, is a triacontadigon.\nArea.\nThe area of a regular hexadecagon with edge length \"t\" is\nSince the area of the circumcircle is formula_1 the regular hexadecagon fills approximately 97.45% of its circumcircle.\nDissection.\nCoxeter states that every parallel-sided 2\"m\"-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the \"regular hexadecagon\", \"m\"=8, and it can be divided into 28: 4 squares and 3 sets of 8 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 8-cube, with 28 of 1792 faces. The list [http://oeis.org/A006245 A006245] enumerates the number of solutions as 1232944, including up to 16-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.\nSkew hexadecagon.\nA skew hexadecagon is a skew polygon with 24 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an hexadecagon is not generally defined. A \"skew zig-zag hexadecagon\" has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.\nA regular skew hexadecagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew hexadecagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a octagonal antiprism with the same D8d, [2+,16] symmetry, order 32. The octagrammic antiprism, s and octagrammic crossed-antiprism, s also have regular skew octagons.\nIn art.\nIn the early 16th century, Raphael was the first to construct a perspective image of a regular hexadecagon: the tower in his painting \"The Marriage of the Virgin\" has 16 sides, elaborating on an eight-sided tower in a previous painting by Pietro Perugino.\nHexadecagrams (16-sided star polygons) are included in the Girih patterns in the Alhambra.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"shape","offset":37},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"corner","offset":64},{"uri":"Regular_polygon","surface_form":"regular","offset":97},{"uri":"Octagon","surface_form":"octagon","offset":255},{"uri":"Square","surface_form":"square","offset":289},{"uri":"Triacontadigon","surface_form":"triacontadigon","offset":333},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":359},{"uri":"Coxeter","surface_form":"Coxeter","offset":545},{"uri":"Petrie_polygon","surface_form":"Petrie polygon","offset":768},{"uri":"8-cube","surface_form":"8-cube","offset":799},{"uri":"Skew_polygon","surface_form":"skew polygon","offset":1028},{"uri":"Vertex-transitive","surface_form":"vertex-transitive","offset":1279},{"uri":"Octagonal_antiprism","surface_form":"octagonal antiprism","offset":1428},{"uri":"Octagrammic_antiprism","surface_form":"octagrammic antiprism","offset":1499},{"uri":"Octagrammic_crossed-antiprism","surface_form":"octagrammic crossed-antiprism","offset":1528},{"uri":"Raphael","surface_form":"Raphael","offset":1629},{"uri":"Perspective_(graphical)","surface_form":"perspective","offset":1666},{"uri":"The_Marriage_of_the_Virgin_(Raphael)","surface_form":"\"The Marriage of the Virgin\"","offset":1736},{"uri":"Pietro_Perugino","surface_form":"Pietro Perugino","offset":1841},{"uri":"Star_polygon","surface_form":"star polygon","offset":1882},{"uri":"Girih","surface_form":"Girih","offset":1917},{"uri":"Alhambra","surface_form":"Alhambra","offset":1939}]}
