{"id":622974,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentacontagon","text":"In geometry, a pentacontagon or pentecontagon or 50-gon is a fifty-sided polygon. The sum of any pentacontagon's interior angles is 8640 degrees.\nRegular pentacontagon.\nA \"regular pentacontagon\" is represented by Schl\u00E4fli symbol and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated icosipentagon, t, which alternates two types of edges.\nArea.\nOne interior angle in a regular pentacontagon is 172\u00B0, meaning that one exterior angle would be 7\u00B0.\nThe area of a regular pentacontagon is (with)\nThe circumradius of a regular pentacontagon is\nSince 50 = 2 \u00D7 52, a regular pentacontagon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge, and is not constructible even if the use of an angle trisector is allowed.\nDissection.\nCoxeter states that every zonogon (a 2\"m\"-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into \"m\"(\"m\"-1)/2 parallelograms.\nIn particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the \"regular pentacontagon\", \"m\"=25, it can be divided into 300: 12 sets of 25 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 25-cube.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":73},{"uri":"Regular_polygon","surface_form":"regular","offset":172},{"uri":"Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol","surface_form":"Schl\u00E4fli symbol","offset":213},{"uri":"Truncation_(geometry)","surface_form":"truncated","offset":270},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":445},{"uri":"Circumradius","surface_form":"circumradius","offset":491},{"uri":"Constructible_polygon","surface_form":"constructible","offset":584},{"uri":"Compass_and_straightedge","surface_form":"compass and straightedge","offset":606},{"uri":"Angle_trisector","surface_form":"angle trisector","offset":679},{"uri":"Coxeter","surface_form":"Coxeter","offset":719},{"uri":"Zonogon","surface_form":"zonogon","offset":745},{"uri":"Petrie_polygon","surface_form":"Petrie polygon","offset":1116},{"uri":"25-cube","surface_form":"25-cube","offset":1147}]}
