{"id":622975,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexacontagon","text":"A hexacontagon or 60-gon is a shape with 60 sides and 60 corners.\nRegular hexacontagon.\nA \"regular hexacontagon\" is represented by Schl\u00E4fli symbol and also can be constructed as a truncated triacontagon, t, or a twice-truncated pentadecagon, tt. A truncated hexacontagon, t, is a 120-gon.\nOne interior angle in a regular hexacontagon is 174\u00B0, meaning that one exterior angle would be 6\u00B0.\nArea.\nThe area of a regular hexacontagon is (with)\nThe circumradius of a regular hexacontagon is\nThis means that the trigonometric functions of \u03C0/60 can be expressed in radicals.\nConstructible.\nSince 60 = 22 \u00D7 3 \u00D7 5, a regular hexacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge. As a truncated triacontagon, it can be constructed by an edge-bisection of a regular triacontagon.\nDissection.\nCoxeter states that every zonogon (a 2\"m\"-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into \"m\"(\"m\"-1)/2 parallelograms.\nIn particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the \"regular hexacontagon\", \"m\"=30, and it can be divided into 435: 15 squares and 14 sets of 30 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 30-cube.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"shape","offset":30},{"uri":"Vertex_(geometry)","surface_form":"corner","offset":57},{"uri":"Regular_polygon","surface_form":"regular","offset":91},{"uri":"Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol","surface_form":"Schl\u00E4fli symbol","offset":131},{"uri":"Truncation_(geometry)","surface_form":"truncated","offset":180},{"uri":"Triacontagon","surface_form":"triacontagon","offset":190},{"uri":"Pentadecagon","surface_form":"pentadecagon","offset":228},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":398},{"uri":"Circumradius","surface_form":"circumradius","offset":443},{"uri":"Constructible_polygon","surface_form":"constructible","offset":631},{"uri":"Compass_and_straightedge","surface_form":"compass and straightedge","offset":653},{"uri":"Truncation_(geometry)","surface_form":"truncated","offset":684},{"uri":"Triacontagon","surface_form":"triacontagon","offset":694},{"uri":"Bisection","surface_form":"bisection","offset":741},{"uri":"Coxeter","surface_form":"Coxeter","offset":790},{"uri":"Zonogon","surface_form":"zonogon","offset":816},{"uri":"Regular_polygon","surface_form":"regular polygon","offset":973},{"uri":"Petrie_polygon","surface_form":"Petrie polygon","offset":1205},{"uri":"30-cube","surface_form":"30-cube","offset":1236}]}
