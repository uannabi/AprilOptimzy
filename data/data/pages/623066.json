{"id":623066,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle","text":"In geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having two \"and only two\" sides of equal length, and sometimes as having \"at least\" two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.\nExamples of isosceles triangles include the isosceles right triangle, the golden triangle, and the faces of bipyramids and certain Catalan solids.\nThe mathematical study of isosceles triangles dates back to ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Isosceles triangles have been used as decoration from even earlier times, and appear frequently in architecture and design, for instance in the pediments and gables of buildings.\nThe two equal sides are called the legs and the third side is called the base of the triangle. The other dimensions of the triangle, such as its height, area, and perimeter, can be calculated by simple formulas from the lengths of the legs and base.\nEvery isosceles triangle has an axis of symmetry along the perpendicular bisector of its base. The two angles opposite the legs are equal and are always acute, so the classification of the triangle as acute, right, or obtuse depends only on the angle between its two legs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":40},{"uri":"Equilateral_triangle","surface_form":"equilateral triangle","offset":263},{"uri":"Special_case","surface_form":"special case","offset":289},{"uri":"Isosceles_right_triangle","surface_form":"isosceles right triangle","offset":347},{"uri":"Golden_triangle_(mathematics)","surface_form":"golden triangle","offset":377},{"uri":"Bipyramid","surface_form":"bipyramid","offset":411},{"uri":"Catalan_solid","surface_form":"Catalan solid","offset":434},{"uri":"Ancient_Egyptian_mathematics","surface_form":"ancient Egyptian mathematics","offset":510},{"uri":"Babylonian_mathematics","surface_form":"Babylonian mathematics","offset":543},{"uri":"Pediment","surface_form":"pediment","offset":711},{"uri":"Gable","surface_form":"gable","offset":725},{"uri":"Perpendicular_bisector","surface_form":"perpendicular bisector","offset":1055},{"uri":"Acute_angle","surface_form":"acute","offset":1149}]}
