It is 5,000 light years from Earth.\nVV Cephei A is one of the largest known stars, being a red supergiant. Its diameter is 1,000 times that of the Sun. It is orbited by VV Cephei B, a blue star with 1325 times the Solar radius. If VV Cephei A were placed in the center of our Solar System, its radius would reach almost to the orbit of Jupiter. Nevertheless, stars like VY Canis Majoris,WOH G64 and Stephenson 2-18 are larger still.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eclipse","surface_form":"eclipsing","offset":15},{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary star","offset":25},{"uri":"Cepheus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Cepheus","offset":44},{"uri":"Light_years","surface_form":"light years","offset":79},{"uri":"Solar_radius","surface_form":"Solar radius","offset":281},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":343},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":403},{"uri":"VY_Canis_Majoris","surface_form":"VY Canis Majoris","offset":437},{"uri":"WOH_G64","surface_form":"WOH G64","offset":454},{"uri":"Stephenson_2-18","surface_form":"Stephenson 2-18","offset":466}]}
