He is best known for two novels that he wrote in the late 1940s, \"Animal Farm\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". In those works, he said that totalitarianism, especially Stalinism, was very bad.\nOrwell fought in the Spanish Civil War with the antifascist troops. These troops were against the dictatorship of fascist governments.\nOrwell died of tuberculosis in London.\nEarly life.\nEric Arthur Blair was born on 25 June 1903, in India. His great-grandfather Charles Blair was a rich gentleman who had married Lady Mary Fane, and he owned slaves and plantations in Jamaica. His grandfather, Thomas Richard Arthur Blair, was a clergyman. His father, Richard Walmesley Blair, worked in the Indian Civil Service. His mother, Ida Mabel Blair, grew up in Burma. He had a younger sister Avril and an older sister Marjorie. When Eric was one year old, Ida took him to England.\nEric grew up with his mother and sisters. Except for a short visit, he did not see his father again until 1912. The family moved to Shiplake before World War I. There, Eric became friends with the Buddicom family, especially Jacintha Buddicom. They read poetry and hoped to become famous writers. At this time, he also liked fishing and watching birds with Jacintha's brother and sister.\nWhen he was five, Eric was sent to a Catholic convent school where Marjorie went. His mother wanted him to go to public school, but his family was not rich enough to pay for it. Ida's brother, Charles Limouzin, was asked to help find the best school to help Eric prepare for better things. He suggested St Cyprian's School in Eastbourne, Sussex. Limouzin, who was a good golfer, came to know the school and its headmaster at the Royal Eastbourne Golf Club. The headmaster helped Blair win the scholarship to pay for his education. He also let Blair's parents pay only half the usual amount of money. However, Blair hated the school.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":54},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"dia","offset":62},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":77},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":134},{"uri":"Animal_Farm","surface_form":"Animal Farm","offset":175},{"uri":"Nineteen_Eighty-Four","surface_form":"Nineteen Eighty-Four","offset":193},{"uri":"Totalitarianism","surface_form":"totalitarianism","offset":245},{"uri":"Stalinism","surface_form":"Stalinism","offset":273},{"uri":"Criticize","surface_form":"very bad","offset":288},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":319},{"uri":"Confederacion_nacional_del_trabajo","surface_form":"antifascist troops","offset":346},{"uri":"Fascist","surface_form":"fascist","offset":412},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":448},{"uri":"Grandfather","surface_form":"grandfather","offset":548},{"uri":"Gentry","surface_form":"gentleman","offset":585},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":603},{"uri":"Slaves","surface_form":"slaves","offset":640},{"uri":"Plantations","surface_form":"plantations","offset":651},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":666},{"uri":"Pastor","surface_form":"clergyman","offset":727},{"uri":"Indian_Civil_Service","surface_form":"Indian Civil Service","offset":789},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":851},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":962},{"uri":"Shiplake","surface_form":"Shiplake","offset":1103},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":1225},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":1296},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":1396},{"uri":"Convent","surface_form":"convent","offset":1405},{"uri":"Golf","surface_form":"golf","offset":1730},{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":1852}]}
