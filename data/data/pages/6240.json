{"id":6240,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino","text":"San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world. It is found in southern Europe and is fully surrounded by Italy (this is called an \"enclave\", and only the Vatican City, Lesotho <nowiki/>and San Marino are like this). Fewer than 30,000 people live there. Its total area is 61\u00A0km2. Its capital is the City of San Marino.\nSan Marino is the world's oldest republic that still exists. It was started on 3 September in A.D. 301 by a skilled builder called Saint Marinus. Its written constitution was adopted on October 8, 1600. The very small nation was recognized by Napoleon's France in 1797, and by the other European nations at the 1815 Congress of Vienna.\nEven though it is an independent country, it depends very much on Italy. Since the 19th century, when Italy was unified, San Marino has been fully surrounded by Italy.\nThe biggest industry in San Marino is tourism. Selling postage stamps is an important source of income, too. San Marino is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is used in San Marino.\nPeople in San Marino speak the Italian language. Most people in San Marino believe in Roman Catholicism.\nGeography.\nSan Marino is covered by the Apennine mountain range, and it has a rugged terrain. The highest point in the country is Monte Titano. There are no bodies of water of any significant size. San Marino has no natural level ground. It is hilly terrain.\nSan Marino is the third smallest country in Europe, Only Vatican City and Monaco are smaller.\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino. There is no major water transport, and no major port or harbour.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of San Marino is strongly similar to Italian, especially that of the Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions. It has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the \"Torta Tre Monti\" (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate. It shows The Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["country"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":34},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":82},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":116},{"uri":"Enclave","surface_form":"enclave","offset":142},{"uri":"Vatican_City","surface_form":"Vatican City","offset":165},{"uri":"Lesotho","surface_form":"Lesotho","offset":179},{"uri":"City_of_San_Marino","surface_form":"City of San Marino","offset":309},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":362},{"uri":"3_September","surface_form":"3 September","offset":408},{"uri":"301","surface_form":"301","offset":428},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":487},{"uri":"Adopt","surface_form":"adopted","offset":504},{"uri":"Napoleon_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":572},{"uri":"Congress_of_Vienna","surface_form":"Congress of Vienna","offset":645},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":826},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":845},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":871},{"uri":"Postage_stamp","surface_form":"postage stamp","offset":888},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":976},{"uri":"Euro","surface_form":"euro","offset":1000},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian language","offset":1059},{"uri":"Roman_Catholicism","surface_form":"Roman Catholicism","offset":1114},{"uri":"Apennine_Mountains","surface_form":"Apennine","offset":1173},{"uri":"Monte_Titano","surface_form":"Monte Titano","offset":1263},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1436},{"uri":"Vatican_City","surface_form":"Vatican City","offset":1449},{"uri":"Monaco","surface_form":"Monaco","offset":1466},{"uri":"Italian_cuisine","surface_form":"Italian","offset":1645},{"uri":"Emilia-Romagna","surface_form":"Emilia-Romagna","offset":1677},{"uri":"Marche","surface_form":"Marche","offset":1696},{"uri":"Torta_Tre_Monti","surface_form":"Torta Tre Monti","offset":1799},{"uri":"The_Three_Towers_of_San_Marino","surface_form":"The Three Towers of San Marino","offset":1931}]}
