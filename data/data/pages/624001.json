{"id":624001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Greenwald","text":"Glenn Edward Greenwald (born March 6, 1967) is an American journalist and author, best known for his role in a series of reports published by \"The Guardian\" newspaper. The first of these reports were published in June 2013. The reports were about the United States and British global surveillance programs. They were based on classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden. Greenwald and the team he worked with won both a George Polk Award and a Pulitzer Prize for these reports. Greenwald has written several best-selling books, including, \"No Place to Hide\".\nGreenwald's work on the Snowden story was featured in the documentary, \"Citizenfour\", which won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Greenwald appeared on-stage with director Laura Poitras and Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsey Mills, when the Oscar was given. In the 2016 Oliver Stone feature film \"Snowden\", Greenwald was played by actor Zachary Quinto.\nBefore the Snowden file disclosures, Greenwald was widely considered one of the most influential opinion columnists in the United States. After working as a constitutional attorney for ten years, he began blogging on national security issues before becoming a \"Salon\" contributor in 2007 and then moving to \"The Guardian\" in 2012. He currently writes for and co-edits \"The Intercept\", which he founded in 2013 with Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["writer"],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Guardian","surface_form":"The Guardian","offset":143},{"uri":"Global_surveillance","surface_form":"global surveillance","offset":277},{"uri":"Edward_Snowden","surface_form":"Edward Snowden","offset":360},{"uri":"George_Polk_Award","surface_form":"George Polk Award","offset":425},{"uri":"Pulitzer_Prize","surface_form":"Pulitzer Prize","offset":449},{"uri":"No_Place_to_Hide_(Greenwald_book)","surface_form":"No Place to Hide","offset":545},{"uri":"Citizenfour","surface_form":"Citizenfour","offset":636},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature","surface_form":"Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature","offset":669},{"uri":"Laura_Poitras","surface_form":"Laura Poitras","offset":755},{"uri":"Oliver_Stone","surface_form":"Oliver Stone","offset":848},{"uri":"Snowden_(film)","surface_form":"\"Snowden\"","offset":874},{"uri":"Zachary_Quinto","surface_form":"Zachary Quinto","offset":915},{"uri":"Salon_(website)","surface_form":"Salon","offset":1192},{"uri":"The_Intercept","surface_form":"The Intercept","offset":1300},{"uri":"Laura_Poitras","surface_form":"Laura Poitras","offset":1346},{"uri":"Jeremy_Scahill","surface_form":"Jeremy Scahill","offset":1364}]}
