{"id":624134,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiero_del_Viandante","text":"The Sentiero del Viandante (in English the \"Wayfarer's Path\") is a footpath in Lombardy. It goes along the eastern side of Lake Como. The path starts near the Church of Saint Martin at Abbadia Lariana in the Province of Lecco and ends at a church called Madonna di Val Pozzo near Piantedo in the Province of Sondrio. The path is about 45 km long.\nThe path dates from Ancient Roman times. It originally went from Milan to the border with Switzerland. In 1989, the Province of Lecco began to clear and restore the trail. It was given the name \"Sentiero del Viandante\" in 1992. It is now one of the most popular hiking trails in Northern Italy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lombardy","surface_form":"Lombardy","offset":79},{"uri":"Lake_Como","surface_form":"Lake Como","offset":123},{"uri":"Province_of_Lecco","surface_form":"Province of Lecco","offset":208},{"uri":"Province_of_Sondrio","surface_form":"Province of Sondrio","offset":296},{"uri":"Km","surface_form":"km","offset":338},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Roman","offset":367},{"uri":"Milan","surface_form":"Milan","offset":412},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":437},{"uri":"Hiking","surface_form":"hiking","offset":609}]}
