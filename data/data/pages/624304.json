{"id":624304,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuchon","text":"Zuchon or Shichon is a hybrid breed dog or a designer dog. It is cross between Bichon Fris\u00E9 and Shih Tzu.\nThe Zuchon is a small designer dog with a height around 12 inches. It weighs 12 to 14 pounds. Because it is a hybrid dog from two purebreds, it is known to have hybrid vigor (extra strength and health). When these dogs are first generation, they could possibly have better health than purebred dogs.\nSince people are usually not allergic to them, Zuchons are generally more suitable for homes with allergy problems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dog_crossbreeds","surface_form":"hybrid breed","offset":23},{"uri":"Designer_dog","surface_form":"designer dog","offset":45},{"uri":"Crossbreed","surface_form":"cross","offset":65},{"uri":"Bichon_Fris%C3%A9","surface_form":"Bichon Fris\u00E9","offset":79},{"uri":"Shih_Tzu","surface_form":"Shih Tzu","offset":96}]}
