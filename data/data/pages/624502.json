{"id":624502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France","text":"Charles VIII of France (June 30, 1470 \u2013 April 7, 1498) was the son of Louis XI, King of France and Charlotte of Savoy. He was born on June 30, 1470 in the Chateau d'Amboise, France.\nCharles became King when aged 13. Because Charles was a minor, his older sister Anne acted as his regent, until he was 21-years-old.\nIn 1488, Anne, Duchess of Brittany was chosen to be Charles's wife. Anne, who was a wealthy, independent ruler had already agreed to marry Maximillian, the heir to the Austrian throne. To prevent the marriage, France invaded Brittany, and forced Anne to change her mind. Charles and Anne were married in December 1491.\nAs a king he was both militarily successful and diplomatically clever, and between 1494 and 1498 he completed an invasion of Italy without much opposition.\nAlthough the young king was active and healthy, his children with Anne were not, and all died in infancy. So, when Charles died in an accident in April 1498, his cousin Louis succeeded him as Louis XII.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["royalty"],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_of_France","surface_form":"King of France","offset":80},{"uri":"Charlotte_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Charlotte of Savoy","offset":99},{"uri":"Chateau_d%27Amboise","surface_form":"Chateau d'Amboise","offset":155},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":174},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":280},{"uri":"Duchess_of_Brittany","surface_form":"Duchess of Brittany","offset":330},{"uri":"Maximillian","surface_form":"Maximillian","offset":454},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":747},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":759},{"uri":"Louis_XII","surface_form":"Louis XII","offset":982}]}
