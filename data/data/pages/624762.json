{"id":624762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Reuleaux triangle is a shape made when three circles cross. It looks like a triangle with round sides and pointed corners.\nTo make one, first draw two dots. Then put a compass on the two dots and draw a circle. Do the same thing again, this time with the other dot as the middle of the circle. Choose either the top or bottom points of the connecting circles as a new center, using the two drawn dots as the edge, and draw the third circle.\nIf \"a\" is how wide the Reuleaux triangle is, the area is formula_1. The perimeter is formula_1.\nA Reuleaux polygon is a shape like the Reuleaux triangle with an odd number of sides.\nA Reuleaux tetrahedron is made when four spheres cross. It looks like a Reuleaux triangle as a pyramid with three sides at the bottom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":60},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":91},{"uri":"Compass_(drafting)","surface_form":"compass","offset":183},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":505},{"uri":"Perimeter","surface_form":"perimeter","offset":528},{"uri":"Odd_number","surface_form":"odd number","offset":617},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":679},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":733}]}
