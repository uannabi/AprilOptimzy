Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. was the son of John Fillmore Jr. (1702\u20131777), a ship's captain. John Fillmore Jr. was the son of John Fillmore Sr. (1676\u20131712), a native and mariner.\nCareer.\nAfter his marriage, Fillmore began farming in Vermont. Shortly thereafter, Nathaniel and his brother Calvin Fillmore were approached by land agents offering tracts in New York state. Unhappy with trying to make the stony ground of their Vermont land productive, they quickly grabbed the opportunity and moved to western New York, sight unseen.\nAccording to biographers of Millard Fillmore, \"The Fillmore brothers moved their two families to their new homeland nestled deep within a timber-laden forest. Location was not their greatest problem. Nor was the dense clay they unearthed once the land was cleared. Their greatest setback came with the realization that faulty surveying coupled with corrupt local government officials had left them with virtually nothing. Duped, tired, and poor, Nathaniel eventually became a tenant farmer while occasionally teaching school, working the soil for landlords and taking their charity when necessary to survive.\nOver time, Nathaniel Fillmore's fortunes changed; he became prominent enough while living in Niles, New York that he served as a justice of the peace for eleven years. He eventually purchased a farm in East Aurora, New York which he developed into a productive enterprise. He died in East Aurora, New York in 1863, and was buried at East Aurora Cemetery.\nHistorians have credited his wife, Phoebe, for convincing her husband to secure a clerk\u2019s position for Millard in the office of their landlord, Judge Walter Wood. Though Fillmore did not complete the clerkship, it did set him on the eventual path to a successful legal and political career that carried him to the presidency.\nAfter Millard assumed the presidency in 1850, Nathaniel visited him the following year, Robert J. Scarry writing that the visit was the one most anticipated by President Fillmore.\nPersonal life.\nAfter Phoebe died in 1831, he remarried to Eunice Love in 1834.\nDistinction.\nHe was the first of only four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., and George H. W. Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":73},{"uri":"Millard_Fillmore","surface_form":"Millard Fillmore","offset":98},{"uri":"List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"13th President of the United States","offset":120},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":252},{"uri":"American_Revolution","surface_form":"American Revolution","offset":340},{"uri":"Joseph_P._Kennedy%2C_Sr.","surface_form":"Joseph P.
