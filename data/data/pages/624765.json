{"id":624765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cary%2C_Jr.","text":"Henry Cary, Jr. (Mid to late 1600s \u2013 18th century) was an American businessman and building contractor, active during the early 1700s. He was the father of Col. Archibald Cary.\nBiography.\nHenry Cary Jr. was born in Colonial Virginia around the mid to late 1600s, the son of Henry Cary Sr., also a businessman and building contractor, and his wife, Judith Lockey. There are few surviving records of his early life but it is likely that he learned about contracting through his father. Cary married three times and had seven children, three with his first wife Sarah Sclater and four with his second wife, Ann Edwards.\nConstruction.\nCary became visibly active in construction after his father's retirement in 1710 and in December 1720 he was authorized to work on the Governor's Palace, in Williamsburg, Virginia, a project that his father had begun but was unable to complete. This was one of several jobs that Cary performed at Williamsburg and in 1726 he was hired to construct new gates for the Capitol.\nHe went on to oversee the construction of several buildings at the College of William & Mary (also in Williamsburg): a chapel wing (1729) and the President's House (1732), and Cary was also likely in charge of constructing the Brafferton building (1723).\nAround 1733, Cary moved to the bank of the James River, where he built Ampthill, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, which served as the Cary family home for many generations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"General_contractor","surface_form":"building contractor","offset":83},{"uri":"Colony_of_Virginia","surface_form":"Colonial Virginia","offset":215},{"uri":"Williamsburg%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Williamsburg","offset":788},{"uri":"James_River","surface_form":"James River","offset":1304}]}
