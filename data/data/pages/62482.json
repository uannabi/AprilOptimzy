Woodside Racecourse opened in 1866 on a park called Stroud Green Farm, it has now closed and is now the site of Ashburton Learning Village, closing in 1890. Woodside station opened to serve visitors to the racecourse, but not a lot of people used it when the course closed so it was replaced to make way for a tram line.\nWoodside is close to South Norwood and Addiscombe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Croydon","surface_form":"Croydon","offset":31},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Croydon","surface_form":"London Borough of Croydon","offset":47},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":74},{"uri":"South_Norwood","surface_form":"South Norwood","offset":425},{"uri":"Addiscombe","surface_form":"Addiscombe","offset":443}]}
