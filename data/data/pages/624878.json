{"id":624878,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Sanger_Institute","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Wellcome Sanger Institute, previously called The Sanger Centre and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, is a non-profit British genomics and genetics research institute. It is funded mostly by the Wellcome Trust.\nThe Institute is on the Wellcome Genome Campus near the village of Hinxton, outside Cambridge. The campus also has the European Bioinformatics Institute. It was established in 1992 and named after double Nobel Laureate, Frederick Sanger. It was conceived as a large scale DNA sequencing centre. It took part in the Human Genome Project, and then made the largest single contribution to the gold standard sequence of the human genome. From its start the Institute had a policy of data sharing, and does much of its research in collaboration.\nSince 2000, the Institute expanded its mission to understand \"the role of genetics in health and disease\". The Institute now employs around 900 people and does four main areas of research: human genetics, pathogen genetics, mouse and zebrafish genetics and bioinformatics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Non-profit_organisation","surface_form":"non-profit","offset":122},{"uri":"Genomics","surface_form":"genomics","offset":141},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":154},{"uri":"Wellcome_Trust","surface_form":"Wellcome Trust","offset":210},{"uri":"Wellcome_Genome_Campus","surface_form":"Wellcome Genome Campus","offset":250},{"uri":"Hinxton","surface_form":"Hinxton","offset":293},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":310},{"uri":"European_Bioinformatics_Institute","surface_form":"European Bioinformatics Institute","offset":345},{"uri":"Nobel_Laureate","surface_form":"Nobel Laureate","offset":430},{"uri":"Frederick_Sanger","surface_form":"Frederick Sanger","offset":446},{"uri":"DNA_sequencing","surface_form":"DNA sequencing","offset":498},{"uri":"Human_Genome_Project","surface_form":"Human Genome Project","offset":541},{"uri":"Human_genome","surface_form":"human genome","offset":646},{"uri":"Data_sharing","surface_form":"data sharing","offset":705},{"uri":"Collaboration","surface_form":"collaboration","offset":752},{"uri":"Human_genetics","surface_form":"human genetics","offset":956},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"pathogen","offset":972},{"uri":"Laboratory_mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":991},{"uri":"Zebrafish","surface_form":"zebrafish","offset":1001},{"uri":"Bioinformatics","surface_form":"bioinformatics","offset":1024}]}
