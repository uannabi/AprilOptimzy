{"id":625037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Le_Prince","text":"Louis Aim\u00E9 Augustin Le Prince (; 28 August 1841 \u2013 vanished 16 September 1890) was a French artist and inventor. He shot what may have been the first moving picture sequences to use a single lens camera and a strip of (paper) film.\nLe Prince was never able to perform a planned public demonstration in the US because he mysteriously vanished from a train on 16 September 1890. His body and luggage were never found, but, over a century later, a police archive was found to contain a photograph of a drowned man who could have been him.\nIn the years after his death, his son Adolphe was in a court, representing Louis, in a battle against Thomas Edison to name the true inventor of motion pictures. Edison won the case and a few months later, Adolphe was killed in a hunting accident.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Film","surface_form":"film","offset":225},{"uri":"Thomas_Edison","surface_form":"Thomas Edison","offset":637}]}
