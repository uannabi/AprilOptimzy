{"id":625067,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2012","text":"Windows Server 2012, codenamed \"Windows Server 8\", is the sixth release of Windows Server. It is the server version of Windows 8 and succeeds Windows Server 2008 R2. Two pre-release versions, a developer preview and a beta version, were released during development. The software was generally available to customers starting on September 4, 2012.\nUnlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2012 has no support for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various features were added or improved over Windows Server 2008 R2 (with many placing an emphasis on cloud computing), such as an updated version of Hyper-V, an IP address management role, a new version of Windows Task Manager, and ReFS, a new file system. Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8.\nThe successor to Windows Server 2012, called Windows Server 2012 R2, was released along with Windows 8.1 in October 2013. A service pack, formally designated Windows Server 2012 R2 Update, was released in April 2014.\nHistory.\nWindows Server 2012, codenamed \"Windows Server 8\", is the sixth release of Windows Server family of operating systems developed concurrently with Windows 8. It was not until April 17, 2012 that the company announced that the final product name would be \"Windows Server 2012\".\nMicrosoft introduced Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 conference on September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only made available to MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.\nBefore Windows Server 2012 was finalized, two test builds were made public. A public beta version of Windows Server 2012 was released along with the Windows 8 Consumer Preview on February 29, 2012. The release candidate of Windows Server 2012 was released on May 31, 2012, along with the Windows 8 Release Preview.\nThe product was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012 and became generally available on September 4, 2012. However, not all editions of Windows Server 2012 were released at the same time. Windows Server 2012 Essentials was released to manufacturing on October 9, 2012 and was made generally available on November 1, 2012. As of September 23, 2012, all students subscribed to DreamSpark program can download Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter free of charge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Windows_Server","surface_form":"Windows Server","offset":75},{"uri":"Windows_8","surface_form":"Windows 8","offset":119},{"uri":"Windows_Server_2008_R2","surface_form":"Windows Server 2008 R2","offset":142},{"uri":"Alpha_version","surface_form":"developer preview","offset":194},{"uri":"Beta_version","surface_form":"beta version","offset":218},{"uri":"Itanium","surface_form":"Itanium","offset":410},{"uri":"Cloud_computing","surface_form":"cloud computing","offset":560},{"uri":"Hyper-V","surface_form":"Hyper-V","offset":608},{"uri":"IP_address_management","surface_form":"IP address management","offset":620},{"uri":"Windows_Task_Manager","surface_form":"Windows Task Manager","offset":665},{"uri":"ReFS","surface_form":"ReFS","offset":691},{"uri":"File_system","surface_form":"file system","offset":703},{"uri":"Metro_(design_language)","surface_form":"Metro","offset":819},{"uri":"Windows_8.1","surface_form":"Windows 8.1","offset":958},{"uri":"Service_pack","surface_form":"service pack","offset":989},{"uri":"Windows_Server","surface_form":"Windows Server","offset":1166},{"uri":"Windows_8","surface_form":"Windows 8","offset":1237},{"uri":"Alpha_version","surface_form":"developer preview","offset":1416},{"uri":"BUILD_(Microsoft)","surface_form":"BUILD 2011","offset":1441},{"uri":"MSDN","surface_form":"MSDN","offset":1584},{"uri":"Graphical_user_interface","surface_form":"graphical user interface","offset":1616},{"uri":"Metro_(design_language)","surface_form":"Metro design language","offset":1656},{"uri":"Software_build","surface_form":"builds","offset":1956},{"uri":"Beta_version","surface_form":"beta version","offset":1990},{"uri":"Release_candidate","surface_form":"release candidate","offset":2107},{"uri":"Release_to_manufacturing","surface_form":"released to manufacturing","offset":2236},{"uri":"General_availability","surface_form":"generally available","offset":2291},{"uri":"DreamSpark","surface_form":"DreamSpark","offset":2601}]}
