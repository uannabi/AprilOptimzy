A thousand kilograms of TNT exploded in a van near his car. His car was passing through St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. People are still trying to learn who did it, and the United Nations have helped to investigate. Serge Brammertz is leading this investigation. Many people in Lebanon said that the government of Syria and its allies did it. So far, Brammertz said that DNA evidence collected from the exploded area shows that the killing was done by a young man who blew himself up at the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":117},{"uri":"Lebanon","surface_form":"Lebanon","offset":135},{"uri":"Lebanese_Civil_War","surface_form":"civil war","offset":333},{"uri":"Trinitrotoluene","surface_form":"TNT","offset":435},{"uri":"Car_bomb","surface_form":"in a van","offset":448},{"uri":"Beirut","surface_form":"Beirut","offset":541},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":602},{"uri":"Serge_Brammertz","surface_form":"Serge Brammertz","offset":645},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":743},{"uri":"Suicide_bombing","surface_form":"blew himself up","offset":897}]}
