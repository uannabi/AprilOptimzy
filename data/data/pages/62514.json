{"id":62514,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(biology)","text":"An antenna (plural antennae) is one of a pair of feelers (appendages) connected to the front segments of crustaceans and insects. They are found on the first two segments of the head. The smaller pair are known as antennules.\nAntennae are jointed and extend forward from the head. They are sensory organs. The organ may sense touch, air motion, heat, vibration (sound), and especially smell or gustation (taste).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Appendage","surface_form":"appendage","offset":58},{"uri":"Morphogenesis","surface_form":"segments","offset":93},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":105},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":121},{"uri":"Antennule","surface_form":"antennule","offset":214},{"uri":"Sensory_system","surface_form":"sensory organ","offset":290},{"uri":"Olfaction","surface_form":"smell","offset":385},{"uri":"Taste","surface_form":"gustation","offset":394}]}
