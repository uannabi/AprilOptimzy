{"id":625179,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Sa-ik","text":"Hong Sa-ik (hangul: \uD64D\uC0AC\uC775, hanja: \u6D2A\u601D\u7FCA, born February 2, 1887 \u2013 September 26, 1946) was a military general for Japan, but he was from Korea.\nIn September 1905, Hong Sa-ik entered the Korean empire military school but switched to a Japanese military school in Tokyo after Japan took over the country. He joined the Japanese military. From 1910 until 1936, he served in the army and he was promoted to general. In 1940, he was appointed to work in the city of Nanjing in China. In 1944 he was sent to the Philippines, where he was put in charge of prisons for captured Allied soldiers.\nIn August 1945, Japan was defeated by the American army and other Allied forces. Hong Sa-ik tried to escape, but he was arrested by the American army. He was called a Class B war criminal, meaning that he committed crimes that are not unusual in war, like harming the prisoners in his camps. But the Allies did not think he planned the war or committed crimes against humanity, like the Nazis who ran the Holocaust.\nOn September 26, 1946, he was executed by firing squad with other Japanese generals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":108},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":131},{"uri":"Korean_empire_military_school","surface_form":"Korean empire military school","offset":180},{"uri":"Japanese_military","surface_form":"Japanese military","offset":311},{"uri":"Nanjing","surface_form":"Nanjing","offset":455},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":466},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":500},{"uri":"America","surface_form":"American","offset":623},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allied","offset":647},{"uri":"War_crimes","surface_form":"war criminal","offset":756}]}
