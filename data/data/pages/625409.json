{"id":625409,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE","text":"e=\"preserve\">MOVE is a Philadelphia-based black liberation group founded by John Africa (born Vincent Leaphart) in 1972. The group lives communally.\nThe group had two major conflicts with the Philadelphia Police Department. In 1978, a standoff resulted in the death of one police officer, injuries to several other people, and life sentences for nine members.\nIn 1985, another standoff ended when a police helicopter dropped a bomb on their compound. This was a row house in the middle of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue. The bomb caused a fire, and killed eleven MOVE members, including five children. The fire burst out of control and destroyed 65 houses in the neighborhood, prompting widespread news coverage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":23},{"uri":"Black_power","surface_form":"black liberation","offset":42},{"uri":"Commune","surface_form":"communally","offset":137},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":192},{"uri":"Life_sentence","surface_form":"life sentence","offset":327}]}
