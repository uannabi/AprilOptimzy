February 1, 1960 in North Carolina is where the setting was. It happened at the woolworth store.\nThere were four men influenced by non-violent protest. Ralph Johns helped put there protest together. The four men were inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. They were inspired by the freedom riders. They planned their protest very carefully. By February 8, 500 people joined the protest. They sat at the table. They wanted to be severed at but didn\u2019t get served. The owners didn\u2019t want the black people to sit there because they didn\u2019t like the color of their skin. They sat at the counter because they didn\u2019t care for there rules and the men wanted their food. The four men went to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College. At Woolworth\u2019s you could only sit on the stools if you were white. This all started because these four men wanted to prove a point about segregation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
