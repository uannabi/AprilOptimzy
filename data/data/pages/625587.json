The Helmholtz Association is named after him.\nIn physiology and psychology, he is known for his mathematics of the eye, theories of vision, ideas on the visual perception of space, and color vision research. His work on the sensation of tone, perception of sound, and the physiology of perception is also notable.\nIn physics, he is known for his theories on the conservation of energy, work in electrodynamics, chemical thermodynamics, and on a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics.\nAs a philosopher, he is known for his philosophy of science, ideas on the relation between the laws of perception and the laws of nature, the science of aesthetics, and ideas on the civilizing power of science.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":88},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":102},{"uri":"Helmholtz_Association_of_German_Research_Centres","surface_form":"Helmholtz Association","offset":181},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiology","offset":226},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":241},{"uri":"Eye","surface_form":"eye","offset":292},{"uri":"Vision","surface_form":"vision","offset":309},{"uri":"Visual_perception","surface_form":"visual perception","offset":330},{"uri":"Color_vision","surface_form":"color vision","offset":362},{"uri":"Tone","surface_form":"tone","offset":414},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":434},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiology","offset":449},{"uri":"Perception","surface_form":"perception","offset":463},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":494},{"uri":"Conservation_of_energy","surface_form":"conservation of energy","offset":539},{"uri":"Electrodynamics","surface_form":"electrodynamics","offset":571},{"uri":"Chemical_thermodynamics","surface_form":"chemical thermodynamics","offset":588},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanical","offset":622},{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamics","offset":647},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":668},{"uri":"Philosophy_of_science","surface_form":"philosophy of science","offset":701},{"uri":"Physical_law","surface_form":"laws of nature","offset":785},{"uri":"Aesthetics","surface_form":"aesthetics","offset":816}]}
