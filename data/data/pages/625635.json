It is from the centre of Paris.\nAntony is a subprefecture of the Hauts-de-Seine department and the seat of the arrondissement of Antony.\nWatered by the Bi\u00E8vre, a tributary of the Seine, Antony is located at the crossroads of very important transport routes, especially the main north-south axis which has existed for 2,000 years. Little urbanized until the early 20th century, the city grew considerably between the two wars, under Senator-Mayor Auguste Mouni\u00E9, from 4,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. In the early 1960s the population quickly increased from 25,000 to 50,000 to accommodate the repatriated people from Algeria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":15},{"uri":"Communes_of_France","surface_form":"commune","offset":22},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":57},{"uri":"Kilometre_Zero","surface_form":"centre of Paris","offset":87},{"uri":"Subprefecture","surface_form":"subprefecture","offset":116},{"uri":"Hauts-de-Seine","surface_form":"Hauts-de-Seine","offset":137},{"uri":"Departments_of_France","surface_form":"department","offset":152},{"uri":"Arrondissements_of_France","surface_form":"arrondissement","offset":183},{"uri":"Arrondissement_of_Antony","surface_form":"Antony","offset":201},{"uri":"Bi%C3%A8vre_(river)","surface_form":"Bi\u00E8vre","offset":224},{"uri":"Seine","surface_form":"Seine","offset":251},{"uri":"Mayor_(France)","surface_form":"Mayor","offset":512},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":685}]}
