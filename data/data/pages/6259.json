{"id":6259,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_verb","text":"e=\"preserve\">Phrasal verb is the name given to an English verb which is composed of two or three words. One verb is combined with a preposition (like \"on, in, under)\" or an adverb (like \"up, down, away\"). Sometimes a phrasal verb can have a meaning that is very different to the meaning of at least one of those two or three words separately. Some text books call these verbs multi-word verbs. Phrasal verbs are used more frequently in everyday speech than in formal, official writing or speaking.\n\"Maria didn't know the word, so she\" looked it up \"in the dictionary.\"\n\"Oh no, we've\" run out of \"milk! I'll have to buy some more.\"\n\"Farmers have to\" get up \"early in the morning.\"\n\"The rocket\" took off \"with a loud roar.\"\nOften these phrasal verbs have a one-word equivalent in other languages.\nIn Spanish, to get up can be translated as \"levantarse\", in French as \"se lever\" etc.\nTypes of phrasal verbs.\nThere are four different types of phrasal verbs.\nInstead of \"separate\" or \"separable\", some text books use the word \"split\" or \"splittable\".\nIf you do not know if a phrasal verb is separable or inseparable ALWAYS use a noun or noun phrase and do not try to separate the verb.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":50},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":58},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"word","offset":97},{"uri":"Preposition","surface_form":"preposition","offset":132},{"uri":"Adverb","surface_form":"adverb","offset":173},{"uri":"Formality","surface_form":"formal","offset":460},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":477},{"uri":"Speaking","surface_form":"speaking","offset":488},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":798},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translated","offset":824},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":855},{"uri":"Separate","surface_form":"separate","offset":966},{"uri":"Split","surface_form":"split","offset":1022}]}
