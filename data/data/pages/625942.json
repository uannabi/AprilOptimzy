It was one of six new Maastriichtian/Danian-aged pterosaurs described in 2018. Two of these pterosaurs are yet to be named.\nDescription.\n\"Barbaridactylus\" was probably a slender pterosaur. Its arm and wing bones were averagely sized for a pterosaur of its time.\nDiscovery and naming.\n\"Barbaridactylus\" was described based from two specimens.\nThe first specimen consisted of a partial jaw, a single neck vertebra, part of the arm and wing bones and the left thigh bone.\nThe second specimen (catalogued as USM93000) consists of a well preserved skeleton.\nPaleoecology.\n\"Barbaridactylus\" was discovered in the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. It coexisted with the pterosaurs \"Alcione\", \"Simurghia\", \"Tethydraco\" and \"Phospatodraco\" and the dinosaur \"Chenanisaurus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":32},{"uri":"Nyctosauridae","surface_form":"nyctosaurid","offset":41},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":53},{"uri":"Late_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Maastrichtian","offset":68},{"uri":"Paleocene","surface_form":"Danian","offset":82},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":131},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":189},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":318},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":524},{"uri":"Vertebra","surface_form":"vertebra","offset":543},{"uri":"Arm","surface_form":"arm","offset":565},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":573},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":578},{"uri":"Femur","surface_form":"thigh bone","offset":597},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":769},{"uri":"Alcione_elainus","surface_form":"Alcione","offset":812},{"uri":"Simurghia","surface_form":"Simurghia","offset":823},{"uri":"Tethydraco","surface_form":"Tethydraco","offset":836},{"uri":"Phospatodraco","surface_form":"Phospatodraco","offset":853},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":876},{"uri":"Chenanisaurus","surface_form":"Chenanisaurus","offset":886}]}
