{"id":62637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker","text":"A baker is somebody who makes mainly bread. Some bakers also make cakes and desserts, but a traditional baker only makes bread. The place where a baker works is called a bakehouse or a bakery.\nThe first bread was made by the Egyptians in 8000 BC and in the Middle Ages most landlords had a bakery. They had a public oven and housewives brought the dough to the baker to cook.\nBread is now much sweeter than it was in the Middle Ages because a lot of corn syrup or honey is used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":37},{"uri":"Cake","surface_form":"cake","offset":66},{"uri":"Dessert","surface_form":"dessert","offset":76},{"uri":"Traditional","surface_form":"traditional","offset":92},{"uri":"Egyptian","surface_form":"Egyptian","offset":225},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":257},{"uri":"Landlord","surface_form":"landlord","offset":274},{"uri":"Oven","surface_form":"oven","offset":316},{"uri":"Housewife","surface_form":"housewives","offset":325},{"uri":"Dough","surface_form":"dough","offset":348},{"uri":"Corn_syrup","surface_form":"corn syrup","offset":450},{"uri":"Honey","surface_form":"honey","offset":464}]}
