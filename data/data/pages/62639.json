{"id":62639,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test","text":"=\"preserve\">A statistical hypothesis test is a method used in statistics. It helps you describe the results you get from an experiment. The hypothesis test tells you the likelihood that a specific result would happen by chance.\nStatistical hypothesis tests answer the question: \"Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of getting a value which is at least as extreme as the value that was actually observed?\".\nSo, for example, if the result would only happen by chance 5% of the time, then the experimental hypothesis is supported to the 95% level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":62},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":124},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":140},{"uri":"Chance","surface_form":"chance","offset":220},{"uri":"Null_hypothesis","surface_form":"null hypothesis","offset":297}]}
