In the city is found the Luxembourg Castle, built by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nHistory.\nDuring the Roman period, two main roads crossed the territory of the present city of Luxembourg; these two roads met at the place \"March\u00E9-aux-Poissons\" (now a street and a neighborhood) dominated by a fortified tower. A castle was built here and it was called \"Lucilinburhuc\" (\"small castle\"). In 963, this place became a property of Siegfried I, a close relative of the Emperors of Germany and Kings of France. Siegfried built a castle, not far from the \"Lucilinburhuc\" castle, on a rocky cliff called the \"Bock\" (). This place is now considered the birthplace of the city, the country and the nation.\nIn 1994 UNESCO named the Old Quarters and Fortifications a World Heritage Site.\nGeography.\nThe city of Luxembourg has an area of, about 2% of the territory of the whole country. The altitude varies between high (Beggen, Bastogne street) and high (Dommeldange); it is high at the centre of the city.\nLuxembourg's climate is on the boundary of oceanic (\"Cfb\" in the Koeppen climate classification) and humid continental (\"Dfb\") climates.\nPopulation.\n, there are 115,227 persons living in the \"commune\", for a population density of inhabitants/km\u00B2.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":26},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":81},{"uri":"Communes_of_Luxembourg","surface_form":"commune","offset":114},{"uri":"List_of_cities_in_Luxembourg","surface_form":"city status","offset":127},{"uri":"Capital_(political)","surface_form":"capital","offset":148},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Luxembourg","offset":163},{"uri":"Confluence","surface_form":"confluence","offset":209},{"uri":"Alzette","surface_form":"Alzette","offset":227},{"uri":"P%C3%A9trusse","surface_form":"P\u00E9trusse","offset":239},{"uri":"Luxembourg_Castle","surface_form":"Luxembourg Castle","offset":304},{"uri":"Franks","surface_form":"Franks","offset":336},{"uri":"Early_Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Early Middle Ages","offset":350},{"uri":"Settlement","surface_form":"settlement","offset":384},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":426},{"uri":"Period","surface_form":"period","offset":432},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":449},{"uri":"Neighborhood","surface_form":"neighborhood","offset":587},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortified","offset":616},{"uri":"Tower","surface_form":"tower","offset":626},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":635},{"uri":"Siegfried_I_of_Luxembourg","surface_form":"Siegfried I","offset":749},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rocky","offset":899},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":905},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":1026},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":1077},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":1200},{"uri":"Beggen","surface_form":"Beggen","offset":1230},{"uri":"Dommeldange","surface_form":"Dommeldange","offset":1265},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":1330},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic","offset":1360},{"uri":"Koeppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"Koeppen climate classification","offset":1382},{"uri":"Humid_continental","surface_form":"humid continental","offset":1418},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"population density","offset":1525}]}
