{"id":626454,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit","text":"A Qubit (or QBit) is a unit of measure used in quantum computing.\nLike a bit in normal (non-quantum) computing, a Qubit has two distinct states, 0 state and the 1 state. However, unlike the normal bit, a qubit can have a state that is somewhere in-between, called a \"superposition.\"\nIf you try measure a qubit that is in a superposition, the qubit will change, and become one of two states. The state the qubit changes to depends on how it is measured. For simplicity, let's assume we are measuring in a way that will make the qubit change to either a 0 state or a 1 state.\nA qubit can be represented as a 2-element column vector.\nA qubit in the 0 state looks like formula_1.\nA qubit in the 1 state looks like formula_1.\nIn general, a qubit state will look like formula_1, where formula_1.\n\u03B1 and \u03B2 are called amplitudes. They can be complex numbers. Each state has an amplitude.\nBy squaring a state's amplitude, you can get the probability of measuring that state.\nEach state can also have a phase. The phase is part of the amplitude and is what can make the amplitude a complex number.\nA state's phase is like how much that state has rotated. The angle of phase is usually represented as either \u03A6 or \u03C6. Let's use \u03C6.\n\u03C6 can go from 0 to formula_1 radians. The angle sort of goes into an Euler identity, where instead of formula_1, the formula_1 gets substituted with the angle \u03C6. The state's phase becomes formula_1.\nThis expression formula_1is a phase factor that becomes part of a state's amplitude. It gets multiplied with the amplitude.\nA phase angle of 0 makes the amplitudes positive real numbers, since formula_1.\nA phase angle of formula_1 makes the amplitudes negative real numbers, since formula_1. (This is Euler's identity)\nA phase angle of formula_1 makes the amplitudes positive imaginary numbers, since formula_1.\nA phase angle of formula_1 makes the amplitudes negative imaginary numbers, since formula_1.\nBeyond 0 and formula_1, the phase angle just wraps back around again, since it is just a rotation.\nAn example qubit may look like formula_1. There is a 50% chance of measuring a 0 or a 1. There is a phase of 1 on the 0 state's amplitude. There is a phase of -1 on the 1 state's amplitude.\nQubits are generally written as kets, which look like formula_1. Kets are part of Bra-Ket notation, also known as Dirac notation. Kets are a way of saying column vector.\nThe 0 and 1 state are written as formula_1 and formula_1 respectively.\nA general qubit in ket notation will be written as formula_1.\nThis equation is exactly the same as formula_1, since formula_1","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quantum_computer","surface_form":"quantum computing","offset":47},{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bit","offset":73}]}
