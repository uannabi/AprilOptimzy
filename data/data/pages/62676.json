It is written as formula_1, but it is not related to the number \u03C0. Some key values of the function include formula_1, formula_1 and formula_1.\nIn general, if formula_1stands for the \"n\"-th prime number, then formula_1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Function_(mathematics)","surface_form":"function","offset":51},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":83},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":124},{"uri":"Pi_(mathematical_constant)","surface_form":"\u03C0","offset":205}]}
