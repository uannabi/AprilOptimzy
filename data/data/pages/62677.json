{"id":62677,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate","text":"=\"preserve\">Bertrand's postulate states that if \"n\" > 3 is an integer, then there always exists at least one prime number \"p\" with \"n\" < \"p\" < 2\"n\"\u00A0\u2212\u00A02.\nThis statement was first made in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand. Bertrand verified his statement for all numbers in the interval [2, 3 \u00D7 106].\nHis statement was completely proven by Pafnuty Chebyshev in 1850. For this reason, the postulate is also called the Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem or Chebyshev's theorem'\". Srinivasa Ramanujan gave a simpler proof. Ramanujan later used that proof when he discovered Ramanujan primes. In 1932, Paul Erd\u0151s published a simpler proof using the Chebyshev function \u03B8(\"x\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":62},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":109},{"uri":"Joseph_Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois_Bertrand","surface_form":"Joseph Bertrand","offset":194},{"uri":"Pafnuty_Chebyshev","surface_form":"Pafnuty Chebyshev","offset":328},{"uri":"Srinivasa_Ramanujan","surface_form":"Srinivasa Ramanujan","offset":458},{"uri":"Ramanujan_prime","surface_form":"Ramanujan prime","offset":551},{"uri":"Paul_Erd%C5%91s","surface_form":"Paul Erd\u0151s","offset":578},{"uri":"Chebyshev_function","surface_form":"Chebyshev function","offset":625}]}
