He worked with hundreds of mathematicians on problems in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, classical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory.\nErd\u0151s number.\nBecause he wrote so many articles, friends created Erd\u0151s number. Erd\u0151s has a number of 0 (for being himself), and his direct collaborators were given the number 1. Their collaborators were given a number of 2, an so on.\nThe Erd\u0151s number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman, a mathematician whose Erd\u0151s number is 1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":31},{"uri":"March_26","surface_form":"March 26","offset":65},{"uri":"1913","surface_form":"1913","offset":75},{"uri":"September_20","surface_form":"September 20","offset":82},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":96},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":116},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":131},{"uri":"Combinatorics","surface_form":"combinatorics","offset":203},{"uri":"Graph_theory","surface_form":"graph theory","offset":218},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":232},{"uri":"Classical_analysis","surface_form":"classical analysis","offset":247},{"uri":"Approximation_theory","surface_form":"approximation theory","offset":267},{"uri":"Set_theory","surface_form":"set theory","offset":289},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":305},{"uri":"Erd%C5%91s_number","surface_form":"Erd\u0151s number","offset":390}]}
