Later the capital was shifted to Rajahmundry.\nThroughout their history the Eastern Chalukyas were the cause of many wars between the more powerful Cholas and Western Chalukyas. Eastern Chalukyan rule of Vengi saw the growth of Telugu culture, literature, poetry and art throughout the region.\nBirth of the dynasty.\nThe Chalukyas of Vengi emerged from (came from) the Chalukyas of Badami.The Badami ruler Pulakeshin II (608\u2013644 C.E) conquered the Vengi region in eastern Deccan by defeating the Vishnukundina dynasty. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as the governor of the new territory in 624 CE. Kubja Vishnuvardhana founded the Eastern Chalukya dynasty after the death of Pulikeshin II in the Battle of Vatapi.\nHistory.\nBetween 641 CE and 705 CE some kings, except Jayasimha I and Mangi Yuvaraja, ruled for very short durations. Then periods with weak rulers followed. At this time, the Rashtrakutas removed the Western Chalukyas of Badami. The weak rulers of Vengi had to face the Rashtrakutas. There was no Eastern Chalukya ruler who could fight against them. During the period of Gunaga Vijayaditya III, the Rashtrakuta emperor Amoghavarsha treated him as his ally (supporter). After Amoghavarsha's death, Vijayaditya made the state independent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chalukyas_of_Badami","surface_form":"Chalukyas of Badami","offset":223},{"uri":"Vengi","surface_form":"Vengi","offset":524},{"uri":"Rajahmundry","surface_form":"Rajahmundry","offset":569},{"uri":"Vishnukundina_dynasty","surface_form":"Vishnukundina dynasty","offset":1030},{"uri":"Kubja_Vishnuvardhana","surface_form":"Kubja Vishnuvardhana","offset":1078},{"uri":"Kubja_Vishnuvardhana","surface_form":"Kubja Vishnuvardhana","offset":1147},{"uri":"Battle_of_Vatapi","surface_form":"Battle of Vatapi","offset":1245},{"uri":"Western_Chalukyas","surface_form":"Western Chalukyas","offset":1464}]}
