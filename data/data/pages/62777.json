She suggested it in her judgment in a lawsuit called Lynch v. Donnelly in 1984.\nThe endorsement test is a question that you can ask if you think that the government is doing something in favor of religion. According to the United States Constitution, the government cannot endorse any particular religion, and cannot endorse religion in general.
