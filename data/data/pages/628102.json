{"id":628102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(mythology)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In\u00A0Greek mythology, Ganymede or\u00A0Ganymedes (,\u00A0\"Ganym\u0113d\u0113s\") was an extremely handsome youth. Homer said he was the most beautiful of all mortals. He was born a prince of Troy. His parents were King\u00A0Tros (from whose name \"Troy\" is derived), and Queen Callirrhoe, daughter of the river god\u00A0Scamander.\nWhen Zeus began lusting for the boy, he went down to Earth\u00A0in the form of an eagle and took him up to\u00A0Mount Olympus. There, Ganymede was made immortal. He served as the cup-bearer\u00A0of the gods. To remember this event, Zeus placed Ganymede into the sky as the constellation Aquarius. Ganymede, the largest and most massive of all Jupiter's moons, was named after this mythological figure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":16},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":104},{"uri":"Troy","surface_form":"Troy","offset":181},{"uri":"Tros_(mythology)","surface_form":"Tros","offset":209},{"uri":"Troy","surface_form":"Troy","offset":232},{"uri":"Callirrhoe_(daughter_of_Scamander)","surface_form":"Callirrhoe","offset":261},{"uri":"Scamander","surface_form":"Scamander","offset":299},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":315},{"uri":"Lust","surface_form":"lust","offset":326},{"uri":"Mount_Olympus","surface_form":"Mount Olympus","offset":412},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":568},{"uri":"Aquarius_(constellation)","surface_form":"Aquarius","offset":582},{"uri":"Ganymede_(moon)","surface_form":"Ganymede","offset":592},{"uri":"Moons_of_Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter's moons","offset":638}]}
