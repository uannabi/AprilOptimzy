{"id":62823,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm","text":"Elms are deciduous and semi-deciduous trees, found throughout the Northern Hemisphere from Siberia to Indonesia, Mexico to Japan. They have alternate, simple, single- or doubly-serrate leaves, usually asymmetric at the base and sharply pointed at the tip.\nElms are hermaphroditic, having perfect flowers, and which, being wind-pollinated, are without petals. The fruit is a round samara.\nElms take many decades to grow to maturity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":9},{"uri":"Semi-deciduous","surface_form":"semi-deciduous","offset":23},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":38},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":66},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":91},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":102},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":113},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":123},{"uri":"Hermaphroditic","surface_form":"hermaphroditic","offset":265},{"uri":"Perfect_flower","surface_form":"perfect flower","offset":288},{"uri":"Petal","surface_form":"petal","offset":351},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":363},{"uri":"Samara_(fruit)","surface_form":"samara","offset":380}]}
