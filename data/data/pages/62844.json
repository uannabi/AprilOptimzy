{"id":62844,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kirk_Clarke","text":"=\"preserve\">Charles Kirk Clarke (c. 1857 - January 20 1924) was a psychiatrist who had a big role in Canadian politics. He was born in Elora, Ontario, to a former parliamentarian. He went to college at the University of Toronto in 1879. He later went on to found the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene. Clarke first practised psychiatry at the 999 Queen Street institution in Toronto. In 1880, then took a post at the Hamilton asylum.\nClarke was a student and brother-in-law of Joseph Workman, Superintendent of the Toronto Asylum. By 1905, Clarke had abandoned the movement, and many of the other leading psychiatrists would follow suit by the end of World War I, when it was clear that eugenic measures were not having the desired effects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1857","surface_form":"1857","offset":36},{"uri":"January_20","surface_form":"January 20","offset":43},{"uri":"1924","surface_form":"1924","offset":54},{"uri":"Psychiatrist","surface_form":"psychiatrist","offset":66},{"uri":"Canadian_politics","surface_form":"Canadian politics","offset":101},{"uri":"Elora%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Elora, Ontario","offset":135},{"uri":"University_of_Toronto","surface_form":"University of Toronto","offset":206},{"uri":"1879","surface_form":"1879","offset":231},{"uri":"Joseph_Workman","surface_form":"Joseph Workman","offset":490},{"uri":"Toronto_Asylum","surface_form":"Toronto Asylum","offset":528},{"uri":"1905","surface_form":"1905","offset":547}]}
