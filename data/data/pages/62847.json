{"id":62847,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale","text":"\"The Internationale\" (,;,,) is a very well known communist, socialist, and social democratic/democratic socialist song. While it was originally written in French, it was translated into many other languages, including English. The most famous versions, however, are those in Russian and Chinese.\nThe French words, written by Eugene Pottier, were originally supposed to be sung to the tune of \"La Marseillaise\", but a separate tune was created for it by a Belgian named Pierre Degeyter.\nThe Russian version, written by Arkady Yakolevich Kots () in 1902, was adopted as the national anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR) in 1918 and as that of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the Soviet Union) in 1922. It stayed like this until 1944, when it was replaced by the State Anthem of the Soviet Union written by Alexander Alexandrov.\nThe Chinese lyrics were written by Qu Qiubai ().\nThe song is known by its tune, and its chorus, which in French begins with \" (meaning \"It's the final battle\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communist","offset":49},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialist","offset":60},{"uri":"Social_democracy","surface_form":"social democratic","offset":75},{"uri":"Democratic_socialism","surface_form":"democratic socialist","offset":93},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":155},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":218},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":275},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":287},{"uri":"Eugene_Pottier","surface_form":"Eugene Pottier","offset":325},{"uri":"La_Marseillaise","surface_form":"La Marseillaise","offset":393},{"uri":"Belgians","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":455},{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":572},{"uri":"Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic","offset":595},{"uri":"Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics","surface_form":"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics","offset":682},{"uri":"State_Anthem_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"State Anthem of the Soviet Union","offset":806},{"uri":"Alexander_Alexandrov","surface_form":"Alexander Alexandrov","offset":850},{"uri":"Qu_Qiubai","surface_form":"Qu Qiubai","offset":907}]}
