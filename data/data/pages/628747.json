He was an Imam of knowledge according to the Zaydi (Fiver) Shia school and Sufis. He lived in a period when Abbasid caliphs were facing many difficulties, the most important of which was Shia revolts. The Caliph Al-Mamun tried to fix this problem by appointing Al-Ridha as the next caliph, however, according to the Shia view, when Al-Ma'mun saw that the Imam gained even more popularity, he decided to correct his mistake by poisoning him. The Imam was buried in a village in Khorasan, which afterwards gained the name Mashhad, meaning the place of martyrdom. Today the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad occupies a total area of 598,657 square meters (147.931 acres).\nWorks.\nFollowing works are attributed to him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":14},{"uri":"Shia","surface_form":"Shia","offset":106},{"uri":"Musa_al-Kadhim","surface_form":"Musa al-Kadhim","offset":134},{"uri":"Muhammad_al-Jawad","surface_form":"Muhammad al-Jawad","offset":169},{"uri":"Zaydi","surface_form":"Zaydi","offset":233},{"uri":"Shia","surface_form":"Shia","offset":247},{"uri":"Sufi","surface_form":"Sufi","offset":263},{"uri":"Al-Mamun","surface_form":"Al-Mamun","offset":400},{"uri":"Khorasan","surface_form":"Khorasan","offset":665}]}
