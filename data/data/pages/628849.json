{"id":628849,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period","text":"The Vedic period (Vedic age) c.\u20091500 \u2013 c.\u2009600 BC is a period in the history of the Indian subcontinent between the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, and about BC.\nIt gets its name from the \"Vedas\", which are religious texts. They do contain some details of life during this period. They are the main sources for understanding this period.\nThe \"Vedas\" were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language. They had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c.\u20091200 or 1100 BC, and centred in the Punjab.\nThe society then spread eastward to the Ganges Plain, becoming more agricultural and settled. The Vedic period saw the emergence of social classes, and developed into kingdoms known as the Janapada. Archaeological cultures show phases of Vedic culture such as the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture, the Gandhara Grave culture, the Black and red ware culture and the Painted Grey Ware culture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":46},{"uri":"History_of_India","surface_form":"history of the Indian subcontinent","offset":68},{"uri":"Indus_Valley_Civilization","surface_form":"Indus Valley Civilization","offset":126},{"uri":"Vedas","surface_form":"Vedas","offset":194},{"uri":"Indo-Aryan","surface_form":"Indo-Aryan","offset":414},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migrated","offset":444},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":490},{"uri":"Pastoralism","surface_form":"pastoral","offset":576},{"uri":"Punjab","surface_form":"Punjab","offset":630},{"uri":"Ganges_Plain","surface_form":"Ganges Plain","offset":678},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"social class","offset":770},{"uri":"Ochre","surface_form":"Ochre","offset":902}]}
