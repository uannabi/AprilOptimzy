{"id":62907,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC","text":"H\u00FCsker D\u00FC was an American hardcore punk and later alternative rock band from the 1980s. The band formed in 1979 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The people in the band were Bob Mould who sang and played electric guitar, Greg Norton who played bass guitar and Grant Hart who sang and played drums. The band stopped playing together in 1987.\nThe band's sound changed very much over the years they were together, but it was always very loud and powerful. The band began as a hardcore band. They played extremely loud and very fast and often screamed their vocals instead of singing. As time went on, the songs began to get slower and more melodic. By the time the band had stopped playing together, their music was no longer punk rock and had changed to alternative rock.\nH\u00FCsker D\u00FC always had more than one singer. This is because the band decided early in their time together that whoever wrote the lyrics of a song would sing that song. This meant that many of the songs were be very different from each other, but it also caused fights within the band. In 1987, the band stopped playing together because of these fights.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":17},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":26},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":50},{"uri":"Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota","surface_form":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","offset":115},{"uri":"Bob_Mould","surface_form":"Bob Mould","offset":167},{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"sang","offset":181},{"uri":"Electric_guitar","surface_form":"electric guitar","offset":197},{"uri":"Greg_Norton","surface_form":"Greg Norton","offset":214},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":237},{"uri":"Grant_Hart","surface_form":"Grant Hart","offset":253},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":284}]}
