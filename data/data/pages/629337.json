{"id":629337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Llorona_(song)","text":"\"La Llorona\" (lit. \"The weeping woman\") is a Mexican folk song. The song began in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Its origins are unknown, but composer Andres Henestrosa in about 1940 popularized the song and may have added to the existing verses.\nOne popular interpretation of the song is of the singer feeling trapped by this woman (La Llorona) who has fallen in love with him. If he even thinks about leaving her, she weeps. He tries everything in his power to leave her, but he is trapped by pity for the woman.\nAnother interpretation is that someone who was so in love with La Llorna climed the highest pine tree to see her, but because the pine tree was young and not solid enough, fell and lost their life. Thus proving that even in death, the admirer still loves La Llorna. \"Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona no dejar\u00E9 de quererte.\"\nThe song \u201CLa Llorona\u201D is featured in the 2017 Disney-Pixar movie \"Coco\"; it is performed by Alanna Ubach (in the English version) and Ang\u00E9lica Vale (in the Spanish version) as Imelda Rivera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":45},{"uri":"Folklore","surface_form":"folk song","offset":53},{"uri":"Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec","surface_form":"Isthmus of Tehuantepec","offset":86},{"uri":"Andres_Henestrosa","surface_form":"Andres Henestrosa","offset":148},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Pictures","surface_form":"Disney","offset":885},{"uri":"Pixar","surface_form":"Pixar","offset":892},{"uri":"Coco","surface_form":"Coco","offset":905},{"uri":"Alanna_Ubach","surface_form":"Alanna Ubach","offset":931},{"uri":"Ang%C3%A9lica_Vale","surface_form":"Ang\u00E9lica Vale","offset":973}]}
