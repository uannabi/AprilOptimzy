{"id":62935,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)","text":"Galicia or Galiza is a nationality in Spain that became a Spanish autonomous community in 1978. It is in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It shares borders with Portugal to the South and the communities of Castile and Le\u00F3n and Asturias to the east.\nHistory.\nGalicia is a green country with Celtic features. Since re-gaining autonomy in 1978, Galicia has been governed by the Xunta de Galicia (government of Galicia). Galicia was strictly governed from 1990 until 2005, during the Manuel Fraga years. The Xunta de Galicia was then under a socialist president Emilio Perez Touri\u00F1o, who had made Galicia more liberal than ever before, until 2009. From March 2009 Partido Popular (right-wing party) won power and the new president is Alberto N\u00FA\u00F1ez Feijoo, who won a second term as President in 2012.\nLanguage.\nGalicia has one main language:\"Galician\" \"galego\". It has many similarities with Portuguese. Galego and Portuguese have the same origin. Spanish is also spoken in Galicia, but mainly as a second language.\nCuisine.\nGalicia is very famous for its fishing industry and seafood remains an important part of its cuisine. A very popular dish in Galicia is \"polbo \u00E1 feira\", (\"polbo\" means octopus). There are many restaurants that serve seafood in Galicia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nationalities_of_Spain","surface_form":"nationality","offset":23},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":38},{"uri":"Autonomous_communities_of_Spain","surface_form":"Spanish autonomous community","offset":58},{"uri":"Iberian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":126},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":168},{"uri":"Castile_and_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Castile and Le\u00F3n","offset":213},{"uri":"Asturias","surface_form":"Asturias","offset":234},{"uri":"Manuel_Fraga","surface_form":"Manuel Fraga","offset":487},{"uri":"Emilio_Perez_Touri%C3%B1o","surface_form":"Emilio Perez Touri\u00F1o","offset":565},{"uri":"Alberto_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_Feijoo","surface_form":"Alberto N\u00FA\u00F1ez Feijoo","offset":737},{"uri":"Galician_language","surface_form":"Galician","offset":844},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":894},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":950},{"uri":"Fishing_industry","surface_form":"fishing industry","offset":1058},{"uri":"Seafood","surface_form":"seafood","offset":1079},{"uri":"Octopus","surface_form":"octopus","offset":1195},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":1220}]}
