It is a non-essential amino acid, meaning the body can make it. Its codons are UAC and UAU.\nTyrosine can be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine. It is also found in many high-protein food products such as chicken, turkey, fish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy products, lima beans, avocados, bananas and eggs.\nIt is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amino_acid","surface_form":"amino acid","offset":52},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":119},{"uri":"Protein_biosynthesis","surface_form":"make proteins","offset":128},{"uri":"Non-essential_amino_acid","surface_form":"non-essential amino acid","offset":151},{"uri":"Codon","surface_form":"codon","offset":211},{"uri":"Phenylalanine","surface_form":"phenylalanine","offset":280},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":325},{"uri":"Chicken_(food)","surface_form":"chicken","offset":355},{"uri":"Turkey_(bird)","surface_form":"turkey","offset":364},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":372},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":378},{"uri":"Yogurt","surface_form":"yogurt","offset":384},{"uri":"Cottage_cheese","surface_form":"cottage cheese","offset":392},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":408},{"uri":"Peanut","surface_form":"peanut","offset":416},{"uri":"Almond","surface_form":"almond","offset":425},{"uri":"Pumpkin","surface_form":"pumpkin","offset":434},{"uri":"Sesame","surface_form":"sesame","offset":449},{"uri":"Soy","surface_form":"soy","offset":463},{"uri":"Lima_bean","surface_form":"lima bean","offset":477},{"uri":"Avocado","surface_form":"avocado","offset":489},{"uri":"Bananas","surface_form":"bananas","offset":499},{"uri":"Functional_group","surface_form":"functional group","offset":560}]}
