{"id":62962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torbay","text":"Torbay is a Unitary authority in England. 120,000 people live there. It is on the south coast and has over 20 beaches. Tourism is very important to the local economy.\nTorbay is not a town. Rather, it contains three towns (Torquay, Paignton and Brixham) and a few villages, the largest of which is Galmpton.\nTorbay was first created as a county borough in 1967, uniting the urban districts of its three towns. In 1974 it became a borough of Devon, its surrounding county. Then in 1993 It was given unitary authority status, having the powers of both a borough and a county. In 2007 a referendum led to the adoption of a directly elected Mayor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Unitary_authority","surface_form":"Unitary authority","offset":12},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":33},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":110},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"Tourism","offset":119},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":158},{"uri":"Torquay","surface_form":"Torquay","offset":222},{"uri":"Paignton","surface_form":"Paignton","offset":231},{"uri":"Brixham","surface_form":"Brixham","offset":244},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":263},{"uri":"Galmpton","surface_form":"Galmpton","offset":297},{"uri":"County_borough","surface_form":"county borough","offset":337},{"uri":"Urban_district","surface_form":"urban district","offset":373},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":429},{"uri":"Devon","surface_form":"Devon","offset":440},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":463},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":583},{"uri":"Direct_election","surface_form":"directly elected","offset":619},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"Mayor","offset":636}]}
