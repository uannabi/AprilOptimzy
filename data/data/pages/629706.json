{"id":629706,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle_2","text":"The \"Beagle 2\" was a British Mars lander that was carried to Mars by the European Space Agency's 2003 \"Mars Express\" mission. It was an astrobiology mission that was designed to look for past life on the shallow surface of Mars.\nThe Beagle 2 was conceived by a group of British academics. It was led by Professor Colin Pillinger of the Open University.\nThe spacecraft successfully arrived in orbit round Mars on 19 December 2003. It was going to land on the surface of Mars on 25 December. There was no contact at the expected time of landing. ESA declared that the mission was lost in February 2004, after several attempts to contact the spacecraft were unsuccessful.\n\"Beagle 2\" fate remained a mystery until January 2015. Then it was found on the surface of Mars by a series of images from NASA's \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\" HiRISE camera. The images suggest that two of the spacecraft's four solar panels failed to deploy, blocking the spacecraft's communications antenna.\nThe \"Beagle 2\" was named after, the ship used by Charles Darwin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":21},{"uri":"Mars_lander","surface_form":"Mars lander","offset":29},{"uri":"European_Space_Agency","surface_form":"European Space Agency","offset":73},{"uri":"Mars_Express","surface_form":"Mars Express","offset":103},{"uri":"Astrobiology","surface_form":"astrobiology","offset":136},{"uri":"Life_on_Mars","surface_form":"life","offset":192},{"uri":"Colin_Pillinger","surface_form":"Colin Pillinger","offset":313},{"uri":"Open_University","surface_form":"Open University","offset":336},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":792},{"uri":"Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter","surface_form":"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter","offset":800},{"uri":"HiRISE","surface_form":"HiRISE","offset":829},{"uri":"Solar_panel","surface_form":"solar panel","offset":897},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":1027}]}
