{"id":6298,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal","text":"is a kind of straight line. A diagonal line does not go straight up, down, or across. It is a line that connects two corners of a line\nIn mathematics, \"diagonal\" has different meanings. For example, in geometry a diagonal is any line that goes between the corners of a polygon. So a square has two diagonals, and a five-sided shape has five diagonals. In general the count of diagonal can be identified by a formula [n(n-3)]/2 where n is the total number of sides of shapes.\nA diagonal connects 2 non-consecutive vertices of a convex polygon. It is not a word to be used to describe a slanted line. Lines in 2D are horizontal, vertical or oblique.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":138},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":202},{"uri":"Polygon","surface_form":"polygon","offset":269},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":283},{"uri":"Pentagon","surface_form":"five-sided shape","offset":315}]}
