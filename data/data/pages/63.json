{"id":63,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration","text":"Speed (a scalar quantity) (uses no direction)\nVelocity (a vector quantity) (uses a direction)\nFinding acceleration.\nSometimes the change in velocity formula_1 is written as \u0394formula_1. Sometimes the change in time formula_1 is written as \u0394t.\nIn difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using mathematics: in calculus, acceleration is the derivative of the velocity (with respect to time), formula_1.\nUnits of measurement.\nAcceleration has its own units of measurement. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2).\nOther words.\nAcceleration can be positive or negative. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word \"acceleration\".\nNewton's second law of motion.\nNewton's laws of motion are rules for how things move. These rules are called \"laws of motion\". Isaac Newton is the scientist who first wrote down the main laws of motion.\nAccording to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's mass (the amount of \"stuff\" the object is made from or how \"heavy\" it is).\nThe formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is formula_1,\nwhere formula_1 is the acceleration, formula_1 is the force, and formula_1 the mass.\nThis formula is very well-known, and it is very important in physics. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short \"Newton's Second Law\", is often one of the first things that physics students learn.\nDeceleration.\nDeceleration is the opposite of acceleration. This means that something slows down instead of speeding up. For example, when a car brakes, it is decelerating.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":308},{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":324},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"derivative","offset":354},{"uri":"Units_of_measurement","surface_form":"units of measurement","offset":463},{"uri":"Positive","surface_form":"positive","offset":680},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative","offset":692},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":978},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"move","offset":999},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":1029},{"uri":"Motion_(physics)","surface_form":"motion","offset":1037},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":1046},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":1066},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":1170},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":1240},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":1520}]}
