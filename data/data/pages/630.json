{"id":630,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction","text":"=\"preserve\">A prediction is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen. It is often very helpful to know what is going to happen to help prepare for these future events. Predictions are based on the idea that two beginning positions that are like each other will have similar results. By watching something happen, it is possible to predict what will happen if something similar happens. Predictions are given by science or fortune tellers or horoscopes.\nThe most common example of a prediction is the weather forecast. Studying how weather happens lets people predict what the weather will be by looking at what is currently happening. This is helpful because by knowing that it is going to rain, a person can wear the right clothes for it.\nNostradamus has made many predictions about the future.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Future","surface_form":"future","offset":184},{"uri":"Event","surface_form":"event","offset":191},{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":228},{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"position","offset":252},{"uri":"Similar","surface_form":"similar","offset":297},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":442},{"uri":"Horoscope","surface_form":"horoscope","offset":472},{"uri":"Example","surface_form":"example","offset":500},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":531},{"uri":"Forecast","surface_form":"forecast","offset":539},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":721},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothes","offset":755},{"uri":"Nostradamus","surface_form":"Nostradamus","offset":771}]}
