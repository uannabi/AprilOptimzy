If a person uses up energy from carbohydrates (starches) and lipids (fats), their body may begin to use protein for energy.\nThe body breaks down protein into energy that can be used. They then do not have enough protein for other needed bodily functions such as growth and building tissues like bones. Usually this is a condition of children from aged 1 to 5 years, but rarely adults and older children get it. It is common in poor places in Africa. Symptoms include having a pot belly, swollen face, and hair that is dark then light then dark. This can be cured by having a protein- rich diet.\nKwashiorkor comes from a protein deficiency (lack) in the diet.
