{"id":630079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOL","text":"STOL refers to short take-off and landing aircraft. They only need a short runway for takeoff and landing. This type of aircraft is made to use short runways for take off and landing in high altitudes, hilly regions, and remote areas.\nAn STOL aircraft has a large wing for its weight. These wings often use aerodynamic devices like flaps, slots, slats, and vortex generators. Typically, an STOL aircraft has lower maximum speed, but good payload lifting. The payload is critical, because many small, isolated communities rely on STOL aircraft for their transport link to the outside world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aerodynamic","surface_form":"aerodynamic","offset":307}]}
