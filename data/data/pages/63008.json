It is a cube with a length, height, and width of one metre, with 1,000 litres of space.\nIn the many places it is spelled \"cubic meter\". Other names are st\u00E8re and kilolitre or kiloliter.\nConversions.\nA cubic metre of pure water at the temperature of maximum density (3.98 \u00B0C) and standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) has a mass of 1000 kg, or one tonne. At 0\u00A0\u00B0C, the freezing point of water, it is slightly less, 999.972 kg.\nIt is sometimes abbreviated,,, when superscript characters or markup are not available/accessible (i.e. in some typewritten documents and postings in Usenet newsgroups).\nAbbreviated CBM in the freight business and MTQ (or numeric code 49) in international trade.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI_unit","surface_form":"SI unit","offset":35},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":46},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"litre","offset":125},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":275},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":325},{"uri":"Atmospheric_pressure","surface_form":"atmospheric pressure","offset":342},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":383},{"uri":"Kilogram","surface_form":"kg","offset":396},{"uri":"Tonne","surface_form":"tonne","offset":407},{"uri":"Superscript","surface_form":"superscript","offset":521},{"uri":"Glyph","surface_form":"characters","offset":533},{"uri":"Markup","surface_form":"markup","offset":547},{"uri":"Usenet","surface_form":"Usenet","offset":635},{"uri":"Freight","surface_form":"freight","offset":678}]}
