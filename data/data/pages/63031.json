{"id":63031,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cayley","text":"Mount Cayley is an eroded stratovolcano. It is 11\u00A0km southeast of Callaghan Lake and 24 west of Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. It is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt which is a segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc.\nA scenario of an eruption of Mount Cayley shows how western Canada is vulnerable to an eruption. The scenario is based on past activity in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and involves both effusive and explosive eruptions. The scenario impact is largely a result of the concentration of vulnerable infrastructure in valleys.\nIn 2003, Catherine Hickson, a scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada, was one of the three scientists to report on the hypothetical eruption at Mount Cayley. The first signs of activity at the volcano would probably be enlarged seismic activity in and close to the mountain. Flooding would turn out to be a huge issue for the community of Squamish and could eventually overrun parts of Highway 99.\nThe Mount Cayley volcanic field is named after Mount Cayley.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stratovolcano","surface_form":"stratovolcano","offset":26},{"uri":"Callaghan_Lake","surface_form":"Callaghan Lake","offset":66},{"uri":"Whistler%2C_British_Columbia","surface_form":"Whistler, British Columbia","offset":96},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":124},{"uri":"Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt","surface_form":"Garibaldi Volcanic Belt","offset":150},{"uri":"Cascade_Volcanic_Arc","surface_form":"Cascade Volcanic Arc","offset":200},{"uri":"Scenario","surface_form":"scenario","offset":224},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":534},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":546},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":573},{"uri":"Geological_Survey_of_Canada","surface_form":"Geological Survey of Canada","offset":592},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":816},{"uri":"Flooding","surface_form":"Flooding","offset":826},{"uri":"Squamish","surface_form":"Squamish","offset":890},{"uri":"Highway_99","surface_form":"Highway 99","offset":937},{"uri":"Mount_Cayley_volcanic_field","surface_form":"Mount Cayley volcanic field","offset":953}]}
