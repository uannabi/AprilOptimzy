Its capital is Hasselt.\nGeography.\nLimburg is located west of the Meuse (Dutch \"Maas\") river, upon which it borders the similarly named province Limburg of the Netherlands. It also borders on the Walloon province of Li\u00E8ge to the south, with which it also has historical ties. To the north and west are the old territories of the Duchy of Brabant, the Flemish provinces of Flemish Brabant and Antwerp to the west, and the Dutch province of North Brabant to the north.\nThe province of Limburg has an area of with a population of and a density of inhabitants per km\u00B2. The province is divided into three arrondissements (\"arrondissementen\" in Dutch) with 44 municipalities. Among these municipalities are the current capital Hasselt, the early medieval capital Borgloon, Genk, Diepenbeek (home to Hasselt University), and Tongeren, the only Roman city in the province and regarded as the oldest city of Belgium.\nThe municipality of Voeren is geographically detached (an exclave) from Limburg and the rest of Flanders, with the Netherlands to the north and the Walloon province of Li\u00E8ge to the south. This municipality was established by the municipal reform of 1977.\nThe highest point of the province, is in the town of Remersdaal, Voeren municipality.\nThe centre of Belgian Limburg is crossed east to west by the Demer river and the Albert Canal, which run similar paths. The Demer river's drainage basin covers most of the central and southern part of the province, except for the southeastern corner, where the Jeker (in French: \"(le) Geer\") runs past Tongeren and into the Maas river (in French: \"(la) Meuse\") at Maastricht.\nThe eastern border of the province corresponds to the western side of the Maas, which originates in France. It's drainage basin includes not only the Jeker but most of the northern part of Belgian Limburg.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe province of Limber is divided into 3 \"arrondissements\" (Hasselt, Maaseik and Tongeren) and a total of 44 municipalities.\nPopulation by arrondissement.\nPopulation on 1 January or on 1 July of each year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flanders","surface_form":"Flanders","offset":59},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":147},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":160},{"uri":"Hasselt","surface_form":"Hasselt","offset":171},{"uri":"Meuse_(river)","surface_form":"Meuse","offset":222},{"uri":"Limburg_(Netherlands)","surface_form":"Limburg","offset":301},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":316},{"uri":"Wallonia","surface_form":"Walloon","offset":352},{"uri":"Li%C3%A8ge_(province)","surface_form":"Li\u00E8ge","offset":372},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Brabant","surface_form":"Duchy of Brabant","offset":485},{"uri":"Flemish_Brabant","surface_form":"Flemish Brabant","offset":528},{"uri":"Antwerp_(province)","surface_form":"Antwerp","offset":548},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":577},{"uri":"North_Brabant","surface_form":"North Brabant","offset":595},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"arrondissement","offset":756},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":795},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":810},{"uri":"Hasselt","surface_form":"Hasselt","offset":877},{"uri":"Borgloon","surface_form":"Borgloon","offset":913},{"uri":"Genk","surface_form":"Genk","offset":923},{"uri":"Diepenbeek","surface_form":"Diepenbeek","offset":929},{"uri":"Hasselt_University","surface_form":"Hasselt University","offset":949},{"uri":"Tongeren","surface_form":"Tongeren","offset":974},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":993},{"uri":"Voeren","surface_form":"Voeren","offset":1084},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographically","offset":1094},{"uri":"Exclave","surface_form":"exclave","offset":1122},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":1179},{"uri":"Wallonia","surface_form":"Walloon","offset":1212},{"uri":"Voeren","surface_form":"Voeren","offset":1384},{"uri":"Demer","surface_form":"Demer","offset":1466},{"uri":"Albert_Canal","surface_form":"Albert Canal","offset":1486},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":1543},{"uri":"Jeker","surface_form":"Jeker","offset":1666},{"uri":"Meuse_(river)","surface_form":"Maas","offset":1729},{"uri":"Maastricht","surface_form":"Maastricht","offset":1769},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":1894},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"\"arrondissements\"","offset":2054},{"uri":"Arrondissement_Hasselt","surface_form":"Hasselt","offset":2073},{"uri":"Arrondissement_Maaseik","surface_form":"Maaseik","offset":2082},{"uri":"Arrondissement_Tongeren","surface_form":"Tongeren","offset":2094}]}
