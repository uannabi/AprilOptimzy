{"id":630378,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crkvenica","text":"Crkvenica is a Bosnian river. It is a right bank tributary of the Vrbanja River.\nCrkvenica rises between the northwestern slopes of O\u010Dau\u0161 and \u0160ipra\u0161ka brda mountains. It flows southeast at around above sea level. The river drains the central part of the northern slopes of the Dinaric mountain massif. Its mouth is in \u0160iprage (Kotor Varo\u0161). It is long.\nThe river is known for its water mills; during the 1950s, there were about 18 of them.\nThe narrow area of the river's headwaters contains a watershed between the confluence of the Vrbas and the Bosna Rivers.\nTufa ste\u0107ci on the Crkvenica riverbank is a relic of the Bogomil settlement in the twelfth century. The ste\u0107ci was originally located at the confluence of the Crkvenica and the Vrbanja. The stones were quarried and built into the walls of the surrounding buildings, possibly due to belief in their miraculous properties. One of the most well-preserved tombstones is in its original location, submerged in the River Vrbanja.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["river"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia","surface_form":"Bosnia","offset":15},{"uri":"Vrbanja_(river)","surface_form":"Vrbanja River","offset":66},{"uri":"O%C4%8Dau%C5%A1","surface_form":"O\u010Dau\u0161","offset":132},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160ipra\u0161ka brda","offset":142},{"uri":"Massif","surface_form":"massif","offset":294},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":318},{"uri":"Kotor_Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor Varo\u0161","offset":327},{"uri":"Headwaters","surface_form":"headwaters","offset":471},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"watershed","offset":493},{"uri":"Vrbas_(river)","surface_form":"Vrbas","offset":533},{"uri":"Bosna_(river)","surface_form":"Bosna","offset":547},{"uri":"Tufa","surface_form":"Tufa","offset":561},{"uri":"Ste%C4%87ci","surface_form":"ste\u0107ci","offset":566},{"uri":"Bogomil","surface_form":"Bogomil","offset":618},{"uri":"Tombstone","surface_form":"tombstone","offset":913}]}
