Charcoal is made from wood by heating it in an airless space at a high temperature. The wood will not burn, but instead turn into charcoal. The by-product of making charcoal is tar and turpentine.\nPeople use it for different things such as cooking on a barbecue grill, and in painting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":14},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":52},{"uri":"Tar","surface_form":"tar","offset":264},{"uri":"Turpentine","surface_form":"turpentine","offset":272},{"uri":"Barbecue","surface_form":"barbecue","offset":340},{"uri":"Grill_(cooking)","surface_form":"grill","offset":349},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":363}]}
