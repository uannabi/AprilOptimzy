{"id":630527,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espa%C3%B1olada","text":"Espa\u00F1olada (translated in English as Typically Spanish) is a derogatory term to those artistic works that gives an exaggerated image of Spanish people based on stereotypes. One of the most notorious example is the Andalusian folklore, being (for example) flamenco very popular among foreign people.\nBackground.\nThis distortion about Spain would have its beginnings in the 19th century, when several European writers and artists from the romanticism era made popular the \"Spanish Myth\". One of those famous novels inspired in Spain were \"Carmen\" by Prosper M\u00E9rim\u00E9e.\nCinema.\nRegarding the cinema, it was created in the 1930s as a subgenre developed after the Spanish Civil War and Francoism. Some known productions were: \"El turismo es un gran invento\", \"Amor a la espa\u00F1ola\", \"40 grados a la sombra\", \"Vente a Alemania, Pepe\" and \"Abuelo made in Spain\" among others.\nAccording Jos\u00E9 Luis Navarrete, these films were so popular because they gave the population an unrealistic and idyllic vision about how Spain should be.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":26},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish people","offset":136},{"uri":"Flamenco","surface_form":"flamenco","offset":255},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":372},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"romanticism era","offset":437},{"uri":"Carmen","surface_form":"Carmen","offset":537},{"uri":"Prosper_M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e","surface_form":"Prosper M\u00E9rim\u00E9e","offset":548},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":657},{"uri":"Francoist_Spain","surface_form":"Francoism","offset":679}]}
