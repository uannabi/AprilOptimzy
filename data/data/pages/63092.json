{"id":63092,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics","text":"The very first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can changed only from one form to another. The law forms the basis of the principle of conservation of energy. This means that anything that uses energy is changing the energy from one kind of energy to another. For example, exercising changes energy from food into kinetic (motion) energy. Another example: In the Sun (or any star), Nuclear Fusion changes mass into heat and light (Electromagnetic Radiation), which travels to Earth and is used by plants to create food (chemical energy) via photosynthesis, which can be eaten by animals allowing them to move (kinetic energy). Energy only ever changes its form; it is neither created nor destroyed. This is why Perpetual motion machines do not exist and could never exist; it would break a fundamental law of physics.\nPeople can use the changes to do work that is useful. Examples of forms of energy in classical mechanics include heat, light, kinetic (movement) or potential energy. However, in modern physics it is considered that there are only two types of energy - mass and kinetic energy, although this may not be helpful to those not familiar with more complex physics.\nThe law means that the total energy of the universe (or any Closed system) is a constant. However, energy can be transferred from one part of the universe to another.\nHistory.\nJames Prescott Joule was the first person who found out by experiments that heat and work are convertible.\nThe first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics was given by \"Rudolf Clausius\" in 1850: \"There is a state function E, called 'energy', whose differential equals the work exchanged with the surroundings during an adiabatic process.\"\nThermodynamics and Engineering.\nBecause of this ambiguity, it is very important in any discussion involving the first law to explicitly establish the sign convention in use.\ndU = the change in internal energy","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamics","offset":22},{"uri":"Conservation_of_energy","surface_form":"conservation of energy","offset":184},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercising","offset":322},{"uri":"Nuclear_fusion","surface_form":"Nuclear Fusion","offset":431},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_radiation","surface_form":"Electromagnetic Radiation","offset":480},{"uri":"Photosynthesis","surface_form":"photosynthesis","offset":590},{"uri":"Perpetual_motion","surface_form":"Perpetual motion","offset":760},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":980},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":986},{"uri":"Kinetic_energy","surface_form":"kinetic","offset":993},{"uri":"Potential_energy","surface_form":"potential","offset":1015},{"uri":"Closed_system","surface_form":"Closed system","offset":1286},{"uri":"James_Prescott_Joule","surface_form":"James Prescott Joule","offset":1402},{"uri":"Work_(physics)","surface_form":"work","offset":1487},{"uri":"Rudolf_Clausius","surface_form":"Rudolf Clausius","offset":1587},{"uri":"1850","surface_form":"1850","offset":1607},{"uri":"Adiabatic_process","surface_form":"adiabatic process","offset":1737},{"uri":"Sign_convention","surface_form":"sign convention","offset":1907}]}
