They were responsible for looking after the \"sacred fire\" of Vesta, which was not allowed to go out. Unlike most other women in Roman society, the Vestals did not marry or bear children, and took a vow of chastity when they joined the priesthood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vesta_(mythology)","surface_form":"Vesta","offset":91},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Rome","offset":101},{"uri":"College_of_Pontiffs","surface_form":"College of Pontiffs","offset":146},{"uri":"Chastity","surface_form":"chastity","offset":397}]}
