{"id":63103,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipper_(butterfly)","text":"The skippers are a family of butterflies, the Hesperiidae. They are named after their quick, darting flight.\nSkippers used to be classified in their own superfamily, Hesperioidea, because they have their antennae clubs hooked backward like a crochet while the other butterflies have club-like tips to their antennae. Skippers also have generally stockier bodies than regular butterflies, with stronger wing muscles.\nSubfamilies.\nMany species of skippers look frustratingly alike. For example, some species in the genera \"Erynnis\", \"Hesperia\", and \"Amblyscirtes\" cannot currently be distinguished in the field even by experts. The only reliable method of telling them apart involving dissection and examination of the genitalia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":19},{"uri":"Butterflies","surface_form":"butterflies","offset":29},{"uri":"Antenna_(biology)","surface_form":"antenna","offset":204},{"uri":"Crochet","surface_form":"crochet","offset":242},{"uri":"Genitalia","surface_form":"genitalia","offset":717}]}
