{"id":631142,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Olof_Palme","text":"On Friday, 28 February 1986, at 23:21 CET (22:21 UTC), Olof Palme, Prime Minister of Sweden, was fatally wounded by a single gunshot while walking home from a cinema with his wife Lisbet Palme on the central Stockholm street Sveav\u00E4gen. Lisbet Palme was slightly wounded by a second shot. The couple did not have bodyguards at the time.\nChrister Pettersson was convicted of the murder in 1988 after having been identified as the killer by Palme's wife. However, he was acquitted. Pettersson died in late-September 2004.\nThe case remains unsolved and has given rise to a number of conspiracy theories. On February 18 2020 the Swedish chief prosecutor in charge of the investigation, Krister Petersson, announced that a likely assassin had been identified. They will announce more information before summer 2020. He also announced that if they cannot prosecute the suspect then they will end the investigation.\nHours after the assassination, Deputy Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson was sworn-in as the new Swedish Prime Minister.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["civilian attack"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Central_European_Time","surface_form":"CET","offset":38},{"uri":"Coordinated_Universal_Time","surface_form":"UTC","offset":49},{"uri":"Olof_Palme","surface_form":"Olof Palme","offset":55},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":67},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":85},{"uri":"Lisbet_Palme","surface_form":"Lisbet Palme","offset":180},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":208},{"uri":"Sveav%C3%A4gen","surface_form":"Sveav\u00E4gen","offset":225},{"uri":"Christer_Pettersson","surface_form":"Christer Pettersson","offset":336},{"uri":"Acquittal","surface_form":"acquitted","offset":468},{"uri":"Conspiracy_theories","surface_form":"conspiracy theories","offset":579},{"uri":"Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Deputy Prime Minister","offset":939},{"uri":"Ingvar_Carlsson","surface_form":"Ingvar Carlsson","offset":961}]}
