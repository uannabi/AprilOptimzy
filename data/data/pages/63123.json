There is usually different sorts in every country.\nBookkeeping and finance.\nIn bookkeeping and finance, \"cash\" can also refer to checks, money orders, cashier's checks, bank drafts, or traveler's checks. In all these forms, the term indicates the most liquid form of assets, which have a fixed value and can be easily converted to currency: \"ready money\". For example, wages or salaries paid as \"cash\" (as opposed to, e.g., stock options) would in most countries normally be paid with checks or direct bank deposits, which are trivially convertible to currency.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":18},{"uri":"Banknote","surface_form":"banknote","offset":36},{"uri":"Coin","surface_form":"coin","offset":49},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":98},{"uri":"Bookkeeping","surface_form":"bookkeeping","offset":135},{"uri":"Finance","surface_form":"finance","offset":151},{"uri":"Check_(finance)","surface_form":"checks","offset":185},{"uri":"Money_order","surface_form":"money order","offset":193},{"uri":"Cashier%27s_check","surface_form":"cashier's check","offset":207},{"uri":"Bank_draft","surface_form":"bank draft","offset":225},{"uri":"Travelers_cheque","surface_form":"traveler's checks","offset":241},{"uri":"Market_liquidity","surface_form":"liquid","offset":308},{"uri":"Asset","surface_form":"asset","offset":323},{"uri":"Wage","surface_form":"wage","offset":425},{"uri":"Salary","surface_form":"salaries","offset":434},{"uri":"Stock","surface_form":"stock","offset":480}]}
