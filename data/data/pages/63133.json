{"id":63133,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_cycle","text":"e=\"preserve\">A thermodynamic cycle is a series of thermodynamic processes which returns a system to its initial state. Properties depend only on the thermodynamic state and thus do not change over a cycle. Variables such as heat and work are not zero over a cycle, but rather depend on the process. The first law of thermodynamics dictates that the net heat input is equal to the net work output over any cycle. The repeating nature of the process path allows for continuous operation, making the cycle an important concept in thermodynamics.\nIf the cyclic process moves clockwise around the loop, then it represents a heat engine, and W will be positive. If it moves counterclockwise then it represents a heat pump, and W will be negative.\nClasses.\nTwo primary classes of thermodynamic cycles are power cycles and heat pump cycles. Power cycles are cycles which convert some heat input into a mechanical work output, while heat pump cycles transfer heat from low to high temperatures using mechanical work input.\nThermodynamic power cycles.\nThermodynamic power cycles are the basis for the operation of heat engines, which supply most of the world's electric power and run almost all motor vehicles. Power cycles can be divided according to the type of heat engine they seek to model. The most common cycles that model internal combustion engines are the Otto cycle, which models gasoline engines and the Diesel cycle, which models diesel engines. Cycles that model external combustion engines include the Brayton cycle, which models gas turbines, and the Rankine cycle, which models steam turbines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thermodynamic_process","surface_form":"thermodynamic process","offset":50},{"uri":"Properties","surface_form":"Properties","offset":119},{"uri":"Thermodynamic_state","surface_form":"thermodynamic state","offset":149},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":224},{"uri":"Work_(thermodynamics)","surface_form":"work","offset":233},{"uri":"First_law_of_thermodynamics","surface_form":"first law of thermodynamics","offset":303},{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamics","offset":527},{"uri":"Heat_engine","surface_form":"heat engine","offset":619},{"uri":"Heat_pump","surface_form":"heat pump","offset":706},{"uri":"Mechanical_work","surface_form":"mechanical work","offset":894},{"uri":"Electric_power","surface_form":"electric power","offset":1151},{"uri":"Motor_vehicles","surface_form":"motor vehicles","offset":1185},{"uri":"Internal_combustion_engines","surface_form":"internal combustion engines","offset":1320},{"uri":"Otto_cycle","surface_form":"Otto cycle","offset":1356},{"uri":"Gasoline_engines","surface_form":"gasoline engines","offset":1381},{"uri":"Diesel_cycle","surface_form":"Diesel cycle","offset":1406},{"uri":"Diesel_engines","surface_form":"diesel engines","offset":1433},{"uri":"External_combustion_engines","surface_form":"external combustion engines","offset":1467},{"uri":"Brayton_cycle","surface_form":"Brayton cycle","offset":1507},{"uri":"Gas_turbines","surface_form":"gas turbines","offset":1535},{"uri":"Rankine_cycle","surface_form":"Rankine cycle","offset":1557},{"uri":"Steam_turbines","surface_form":"steam turbines","offset":1585}]}
