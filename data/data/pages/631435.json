By the age of fifteen he was working for his father in a small workshop for bleaching textiles at Legnano. In 1898 the family started a textile factory at Legnano.

Bernocchi's brothers, Andrea and Michele, also contributed to the construction of the pavillion.\nThe Coppa Bernocchi, a bicycle race held at Legnano since 1919, is dedicated to Bernocchi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":74},{"uri":"Legnano","surface_form":"Legnano","offset":93},{"uri":"Lombardy","surface_form":"Lombardy","offset":116},{"uri":"Castellanza","surface_form":"Castellanza","offset":198},{"uri":"Provinces_of_Italy","surface_form":"province","offset":217},{"uri":"Province_of_Varese","surface_form":"Varese","offset":229},{"uri":"Busto_Arsizio","surface_form":"Busto Arsizio","offset":375},{"uri":"Bleach","surface_form":"bleach","offset":502},{"uri":"Legnano","surface_form":"Legnano","offset":524},{"uri":"Nerviano","surface_form":"Nerviano","offset":697},{"uri":"Cerro_Maggiore","surface_form":"Cerro Maggiore","offset":707},{"uri":"Angera","surface_form":"Angera","offset":726},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":751},{"uri":"Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":796},{"uri":"Italian_defeat_at_Caporetto","surface_form":"Italian defeat at Caporetto","offset":859},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":890},{"uri":"Charity","surface_form":"charity","offset":923},{"uri":"Veteran","surface_form":"veteran","offset":939},{"uri":"Opera_Nazionale_Combattenti","surface_form":"Opera Nazionale Combattenti","offset":1006},{"uri":"La_Scala","surface_form":"La Scala","offset":1183},{"uri":"Italian_lira","surface_form":"lire","offset":1240},{"uri":"Triennale","surface_form":"Triennale","offset":1325},{"uri":"Parco_Sempione","surface_form":"Parco Sempione","offset":1354},{"uri":"Giovanni_Muzio","surface_form":"Giovanni Muzio","offset":1433},{"uri":"Coppa_Bernocchi","surface_form":"Coppa Bernocchi","offset":1582}]}
