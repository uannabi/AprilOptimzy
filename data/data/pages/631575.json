That name was named after Robert Morrison, who is a missionary. The mountain is usually called Yushan or Mount Jade.\nIn the winter, the top of Yushan usually has a lot of thick snow.

The Yushan Range is in Yushan National Park. The area has the largest amount of natural space that has not been developed.
