{"id":63165,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_state","text":"e=\"preserve\">A thermodynamic state is the macroscopic condition of a thermodynamic system as described by its particular thermodynamic parameters. The state of any thermodynamic system can be described by a set of thermodynamic parameters, such as temperature, pressure, density, composition, independently of its surroundings or history.\nThe parameters required to specify the state depend on the characteristics of the system. There is an optimal ensemble of parameters that uniquely specify the state, and all other parameters can be derived from these. The \"state postulate\" says that the state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent, intensive properties.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Macroscopy","surface_form":"macroscopic","offset":42},{"uri":"Thermodynamic_system","surface_form":"thermodynamic system","offset":69},{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamic parameters","offset":121},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":248},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":261},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":271},{"uri":"Composition_(natural_science)","surface_form":"composition","offset":280},{"uri":"Intensive_quantity","surface_form":"intensive properties","offset":675}]}
