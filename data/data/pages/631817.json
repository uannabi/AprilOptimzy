{"id":631817,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps","text":"\"Cordyceps\" is a genus of ascomycete fungi (sac fungi) with about 400 species. Most \"Cordyceps\" species are parasitoids. They are parasitic mainly on insects and other arthropods. A few are parasitic on other fungi. The generic name \"Cordyceps\" is taken from the Greek word \u03BA\u03BF\u03C1\u03B4\u03CD\u03BB\u03B7 \"kord\u00FDl\u0113\", meaning \"club\", and the Latin stem \"-ceps\", meaning \"head\".\nThe genus has a worldwide distribution. Most of the 400 species have been described from Asia (notably Nepal, China, Japan, Bhutan, Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand). \"Cordyceps\" species are particularly abundant and diverse in humid temperate and tropical forests.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":17},{"uri":"Ascomycete","surface_form":"ascomycete","offset":26},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":37},{"uri":"Parasitoid","surface_form":"parasitoid","offset":108},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":150},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":168},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":263},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":317},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":456},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":463},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":470},{"uri":"Bhutan","surface_form":"Bhutan","offset":477},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":485},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":492},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":505},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":583},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":597},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":606}]}
