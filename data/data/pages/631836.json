The term is now used very commonly by many research groups in Australia, New Zealand, France, and the United Kingdom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":220},{"uri":"Platonic_solids","surface_form":"Platonic solids","offset":233},{"uri":"Plate","surface_form":"plate","offset":289},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":300}]}
