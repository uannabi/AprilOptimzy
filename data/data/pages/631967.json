It entered at number two in the UK and at three in her home country of the US. With the song, she became the first act to have the first singles from four albums enter in the top ten of the Hot 100.\nBackground.\nAfter taking a break from social media since New Year's Eve 2017, Grande promoted the release of the song on social media using upside-down, flipped font (\u028E\u0279\u0254 o\u0287 \u0287\u025F\u01DDl s\u0279\u0250\u01DD\u0287 ou). Meaghan Garvey from \"Pitchfork\" called the song \"diva house\" and the beat \"UK garage-inspired,\" perhaps as a \"nod to Manchester,\" referring to the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing in England that occurred on Grande's Dangerous Woman Tour.\nMusic video.\nThe video features Grande and Grimes in a city with dancers and climbing up buildings and streets at right angles. It was nominated at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Video of the Year, winning the first of these.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ariana_Grande","surface_form":"Ariana Grande","offset":76},{"uri":"Sweetener_(Ariana_Grande_album)","surface_form":"\"Sweetener\"","offset":143},{"uri":"ARIA_Charts","surface_form":"ARIA Singles Chart","offset":320},{"uri":"UK_Singles_Chart","surface_form":"UK","offset":372},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"Hot 100","offset":530},{"uri":"House_music","surface_form":"house","offset":783},{"uri":"UK_garage","surface_form":"UK garage","offset":804},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":846},{"uri":"Manchester_Arena_bombing","surface_form":"Manchester Arena bombing","offset":885},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":913},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angles","offset":1083},{"uri":"MTV","surface_form":"MTV Video Music Awards","offset":1126}]}
