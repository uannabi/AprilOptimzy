{"id":632038,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation","text":"=\"preserve\">A cation is an ion with fewer electrons than protons. Therefore, it has a positive charge.\nThe electric charge on a proton is equal in amount to the charge on an electron. So, the total electric charge on an ion is the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":27},{"uri":"Electrons","surface_form":"electrons","offset":42},{"uri":"Protons","surface_form":"protons","offset":57},{"uri":"Positive_charge","surface_form":"positive charge","offset":86}]}
