It is located at 1218 Glendon Avenue in Westwood.\nHistory.\nThe cemetery was founded as Sunset Cemetery in 1905, but had been used for burials since the 1880s and was renamed with current name in 1926.\nAlthough it is the resting place of some of the entertainment industry's greatest names, it also contains the graves of many uncelebrated people. For example, when Marilyn Monroe died in 1962, Joe DiMaggio, responsible for Monroe's arrangements, chose Westwood not because of its celebrities but because it was the resting place of Monroe's mother's friend, Grace Goddard, and Goddard's aunt, Ana Lower, both of whom had cared for Monroe as a child.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Westwood%2C_Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Westwood Village","offset":53},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":73},{"uri":"Show_business","surface_form":"entertainment industry","offset":335},{"uri":"Marilyn_Monroe","surface_form":"Marilyn Monroe","offset":451},{"uri":"Joe_DiMaggio","surface_form":"Joe DiMaggio","offset":480}]}
