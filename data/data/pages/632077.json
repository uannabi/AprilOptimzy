He is the grandfather of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\nWhile out on an afternoon walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913, he was shot at close range in the back by Alexandros Schinas, who was \"said to belong to a Socialist organization\" and \"declared when arrested that he had killed the King because he refused to give him money\". George died instantly, the bullet having penetrated his heart.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_kings_of_Greece","surface_form":"King","offset":130},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Greece_(Gl%C3%BCcksburg)","surface_form":"Greece","offset":138},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_history","surface_form":"modern Greek history","offset":238},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":302},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":338},{"uri":"Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","offset":383},{"uri":"White_Tower_of_Thessaloniki","surface_form":"White Tower","offset":457},{"uri":"Alexandros_Schinas","surface_form":"Alexandros Schinas","offset":529}]}
