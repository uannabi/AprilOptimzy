Butterflies evolved from moths, and this group is rather moth-like.\nThey are living sister group to the butterfly superfamily Papilionoidea. In 1986, Scoble combined all 35 species into a single genus \"Macrosoma\". They are all entirely neotropical species from central and southern America and the Caribbean.\nDNA sequence analysis of this group continues.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":15},{"uri":"Insects","surface_form":"insects","offset":25},{"uri":"Lepidoptera","surface_form":"lepidoptera","offset":40},{"uri":"Moths","surface_form":"moths","offset":139},{"uri":"Extant_taxon","surface_form":"living","offset":191},{"uri":"Sister_group","surface_form":"sister group","offset":198},{"uri":"Papilionoidea","surface_form":"Papilionoidea","offset":240},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"neotropical","offset":350},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"central","offset":375},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"southern America","offset":387},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":412},{"uri":"DNA_sequence","surface_form":"DNA sequence","offset":423}]}
