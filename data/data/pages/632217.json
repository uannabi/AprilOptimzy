Hall is Professor Emeritus of Biology at Brandeis University.\nHall spent his career testing the neurological component of fly courtship and behavioral rhythms. Through his research on the neurology and behavior of \"Drosophila melanogaster\", Hall uncovered essential mechanisms of biological clocks and shed light on the foundations for sexual differentiation in the nervous system.\nHall was elected to the National Academy of Sciences for his revolutionary work in the field of chronobiology. Along with Michael W. Young and Michael Rosbash, he was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geneticist","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":54},{"uri":"Chronobiology","surface_form":"chronobiologist","offset":69},{"uri":"Professor_Emeritus","surface_form":"Professor Emeritus","offset":94},{"uri":"Brandeis_University","surface_form":"Brandeis University","offset":127},{"uri":"Drosophila_melanogaster","surface_form":"Drosophila melanogaster","offset":301},{"uri":"National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":492},{"uri":"Chronobiology","surface_form":"chronobiology","offset":564},{"uri":"Michael_W._Young","surface_form":"Michael W.
