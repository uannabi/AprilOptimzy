He was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Jeffrey C. Hall and Michael Rosbash \"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drosophila_melanogaster","surface_form":"Drosophila melanogaster","offset":203},{"uri":"Rockefeller_University","surface_form":"Rockefeller University","offset":242},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":432},{"uri":"Jeffrey_C._Hall","surface_form":"Jeffrey C.
