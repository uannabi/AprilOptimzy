{"id":63233,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The planet Saturn has 53 named moons, and another 29 which are still being studied. Many of the moons are very small: 33 are less than in diameter and thirteen moons are less than. Many of the moons are named after Titans, Giants, or minor Greek or Roman gods. Some of Saturn's moons are very large; the moon Titan is bigger than the planet Mercury.\nConfirmed moons.\nThe moons of Saturn are listed here by orbital period (or semi-major axis), from shortest to longest. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold, while the irregular moons are listed in red, orange and gray background.\nVery recently, there have been 20 new discoveries of moons on saturn that have not yet been named.\n! Mass(kg)\n! Eccentricity\n! Discoveryyear\nUnconfirmed moons.\nThe following objects (observed by \"Cassini\") have not been confirmed as solid bodies. It is not yet clear if these are real satellites or merely persistent clumps within the F Ring.\nHypothetical moons.\nTwo moons were claimed to be discovered by different astronomers but never seen again. Both moons were said to orbit between Titan and Hyperion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":18},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":25},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moons","offset":45},{"uri":"Titan_(mythology)","surface_form":"Titans","offset":229},{"uri":"Giant","surface_form":"Giants","offset":237},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":254},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":263},{"uri":"Titan_(moon)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":323},{"uri":"Mercury_(planet)","surface_form":"Mercury","offset":355},{"uri":"Orbital_period","surface_form":"orbital period","offset":420},{"uri":"Gravitational_collapse","surface_form":"collapsed","offset":531},{"uri":"Spheroid","surface_form":"spheroid","offset":548},{"uri":"List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_mass","surface_form":"Mass","offset":756},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"Eccentricity","offset":767},{"uri":"Timeline_of_discovery_of_Solar_System_planets_and_their_moons","surface_form":"Discoveryyear","offset":782},{"uri":"Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens","surface_form":"Cassini","offset":851},{"uri":"Titan_(moon)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":1143},{"uri":"Hyperion_(moon)","surface_form":"Hyperion","offset":1153}]}
