{"id":63234,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vande_Mataram","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vande Mataram is the national song of India. It is not to be confused with the national anthem of India. The lyrics were written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, in a mix of Sanskrit and Bengali. The song was written in 1876, but published in 1882. The title means \"Long live the Mother[land]\". The first version of the Flag of India had \"\u0935\u0928\u094D\u0926\u0947 \u092E\u093E\u0924\u0930\u092E\u094D\" (Vande Mataram) written on it.\nControversy.\nJana Gana Mana was chosen over \"Vande Mataram\" as the National Anthem of independent India in January 24, 1950, although before this date, \"Vande Mataram\" was treated as such. Vande Mataram was rejected because it offended Muslims by calling India \"Mother Durga\" (a Hindu goddess), equating the nation with Hinduism, and by its origin as part of \"Anandamatha\", a book they felt had an anti-Muslim message.\nTranslation.\nCool with thy winds of delight,\nGreen fields waving Mother of might,\nOver thy branches and lordly streams,\nWho hath said thou art weak in thy lands\nWhen swords flash out in seventy million hands\nThy dreadful name from shore to shore?\nWith many strengths who art mighty and stored,\nTo thee I call Mother and Lord!\nThou who saves, arise and save!\nTo her I cry who ever her foe drove\nThou art wisdom, thou art law,\nThou art heart, our soul, our breath\nThough art love divine, the awe\nIn our hearts that conquers death.\nThine the strength that nerves the arm,\nThine the beauty, thine the charm.\nIn our temples is but thine.\nThou art Durga, Lady and Queen,\nWith her hands that strike and her\nIn thy soul, with jewelled hair\nMother sweet, I bow to thee,\n\"translated by Sri Aurobindo\"\nTranslation.\nCool with thy winds of delight,\nGreen fields waving Mother of might,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jana_Gana_Mana","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":92},{"uri":"Bankim_Chandra_Chattopadhyay","surface_form":"Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay","offset":145},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":187},{"uri":"Bengali_language","surface_form":"Bengali","offset":200},{"uri":"1876","surface_form":"1876","offset":233},{"uri":"1882","surface_form":"1882","offset":256},{"uri":"Flag_of_India","surface_form":"Flag of India","offset":333},{"uri":"Jana_Gana_Mana","surface_form":"Jana Gana Mana","offset":410},{"uri":"January_24","surface_form":"January 24","offset":504},{"uri":"1950","surface_form":"1950","offset":516},{"uri":"Sri_Aurobindo","surface_form":"Sri Aurobindo","offset":1592}]}
