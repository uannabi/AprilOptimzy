{"id":63238,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In thermodynamics, work transfer is an energy transfer in which temperature is not considered during energy transfer. Unit is always in Joules. It is also a result of force acting through the distance. W=FxD\n1845.\nIn 1845, the English physicist James Joule wrote a paper \"On the mechanical equivalent of heat\" for the British Association meeting in Cambridge. In this work, he reported his best-known experiment, in which the work released through the action of a \"weight \"falling\" through a height\" was used to turn a paddle-wheel in an insulated barrel of water.\nIn this experiment, the friction and agitation of the paddle-wheel on the body of water caused heat to be generated which, in turn, increased the temperature of water. Both the temperature change \u2206T of the water and the height of the fall \u2206h of the weight mg were recorded. Using these values, Joule was able to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat. Joule estimated a mechanical equivalent of heat to be 819\u00A0ft\u2022lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). The modern day definitions of heat, work, temperature, and energy all have connection to this experiment.\nOverview.\nAccording to the \"First law of thermodynamics\", it is useful to separate changes to the internal energy of a thermodynamic system into two sorts of energy transfers. Work refers to forms of energy transfer which can be accounted for in terms of changes in the \"macroscopic\" physical variables of the system, for example energy which goes into expanding the volume of a system against an external pressure, by driving a piston-head out of a cylinder against an external force. This is in contrast to heat energy, which is carried into or out of the system in the form of transfers in the \"microscopic\" thermal motions of particles.\nThe concept of thermodynamic work is slightly more general than that of mechanical work because it includes other types of energy transfers as well. The electrical work required to move a charge against an external electrical field can be measured, as can the work required to move heat against a temperature gradient. Thermodynamic work need not have any mechanical component to be considered such.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamics","offset":16},{"uri":"James_Prescott_Joule","surface_form":"James Joule","offset":258},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":362},{"uri":"Mechanical_work","surface_form":"work","offset":439},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":673},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":724},{"uri":"Mechanical_equivalent_of_heat","surface_form":"mechanical equivalent of heat","offset":904},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":1077},{"uri":"First_law_of_thermodynamics","surface_form":"First law of thermodynamics","offset":1152},{"uri":"Internal_energy","surface_form":"internal energy","offset":1222},{"uri":"Thermodynamic_system","surface_form":"thermodynamic system","offset":1243},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":1530},{"uri":"Piston","surface_form":"piston-head","offset":1553},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":1633}]}
