{"id":63248,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Bacon number of an actor or actress is the number of degrees of separation (see Six degrees of separation) they have from actor Kevin Bacon, as defined by the game known as Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. It applies the Erd\u0151s number concept to the movie industry. The higher the Bacon number, the farther away from Kevin Bacon the actor is.\nFor example, Kevin Bacon's Bacon number is 0. If an actor works in a movie with Kevin Bacon, the actor's Bacon number is 1. If an actor works with an actor who worked with Kevin Bacon in a movie, the first actor's Bacon number is 2, and so forth.\nReferences.\n2. \"Modern Family\", \"Daddy Issues\" (2018)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":36},{"uri":"Six_degrees_of_separation","surface_form":"Six degrees of separation","offset":97},{"uri":"Kevin_Bacon","surface_form":"Kevin Bacon","offset":145},{"uri":"Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon","surface_form":"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon","offset":190},{"uri":"Erd%C5%91s_number","surface_form":"Erd\u0151s number","offset":233},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":423},{"uri":"Kevin_Bacon","surface_form":"Kevin Bacon","offset":434},{"uri":"Modern_Family","surface_form":"\"Modern Family\"","offset":616}]}
