It was the administrative center of Judaea in the Roman Empire. Later it was the capital of the Byzantine Palaestina Prima province during the classic period.\nIn the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, it was the last city to fall to the Arabs. The city had an Arab majority until the Crusader conquest. It was abandoned after the Mamluk conquest. It was re-populated in 1884 by Bosniak immigrants, who settled in a small fishing village. In 1952, the Jewish town of Caesarea was established near the ruins of the old city. The ruins were made into the national park of Caesarea Maritima.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":92},{"uri":"Tel_Aviv","surface_form":"Tel Aviv","offset":121},{"uri":"Haifa","surface_form":"Haifa","offset":134},{"uri":"Coastal","surface_form":"coastal","offset":147},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":155},{"uri":"Hadera","surface_form":"Hadera","offset":178},{"uri":"Council","surface_form":"council","offset":344},{"uri":"Herod_the_Great","surface_form":"Herod the Great","offset":375},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":403},{"uri":"Caesarea_Maritima","surface_form":"Caesarea Maritima","offset":423},{"uri":"Judaea","surface_form":"Judaea","offset":478},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":492},{"uri":"Byzantine","surface_form":"Byzantine","offset":538},{"uri":"Palaestina_Prima","surface_form":"Palaestina Prima","offset":548},{"uri":"Muslim_conquest","surface_form":"Muslim conquest","offset":608},{"uri":"Levant","surface_form":"Levant","offset":631},{"uri":"Crusader","surface_form":"Crusader","offset":741},{"uri":"Mamluk","surface_form":"Mamluk","offset":787},{"uri":"Bosniak","surface_form":"Bosniak","offset":835}]}
