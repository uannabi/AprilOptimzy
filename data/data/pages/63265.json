The official residences of the two most senior Government ministers are here. These are the Prime Minister, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nDowning Street is a few minutes' walk from the Houses of Parliament. The street was built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet (1632\u20131689) on the site of a mansion called Hampden House. The Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Chief Whip all have official residences in buildings along one side of the street. The houses on the other side were all replaced by the Foreign Office in the nineteenth century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":30},{"uri":"Whitehall","surface_form":"Whitehall","offset":53},{"uri":"Buckingham_Palace","surface_form":"Buckingham Palace","offset":67},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":178},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","surface_form":"Chancellor of the Exchequer","offset":202},{"uri":"Houses_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Houses of Parliament","offset":278},{"uri":"Sir_George_Downing%2C_1st_Baronet","surface_form":"Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet","offset":337},{"uri":"Chief_Whip","surface_form":"Chief Whip","offset":489},{"uri":"Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office","surface_form":"Foreign Office","offset":626}]}
