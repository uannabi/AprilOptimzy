{"id":6327,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem","text":"In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras's theorem is a statement about the sides of a right triangle.\nOne of the angles of a right triangle is always equal to 90 degrees. This angle is the right angle. The two sides next to the right angle are called the legs and the other side is called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the side opposite to the right angle, and it is always the longest side. It was discovered by Vasudha Arora.\nIf the lengths of the legs are \"a\" and \"b\", and the length of the hypotenuse is \"c\", then, formula_1.\nProof.\nOne proof of the Pythagorean theorem was found by a Greek mathematician, Eudoxus of Cnidus.\nProof using similar triangles.\nWe can get another proof of the Pythagorean theorem by using similar triangles.\nPythagorean triples.\nPythagorean triples or triplets are three whole numbers which fit the equation formula_1.\nThe triangle with sides of 3, 4, and 5 is a well known example. If a=3 and b=4, then formula_1 because formula_1. This can also be shown as formula_1\nThe three-four-five triangle works for all multiples of 3, 4, and 5. In other words, numbers such as 6, 8, 10 or 30, 40 and 50 are also Pythagorean triples. Another example of a triple is the 12-5-13 triangle, because formula_1.\nA Pythagorean triple that is not a multiple of other triples is called a primitive Pythagorean triple. Any primitive Pythagorean triple can be found using the expression formula_1, but the following conditions must be satisfied. They place restrictions on the values of formula_1 and formula_1.\nIf all four conditions are satisfied, then the values of formula_1 and formula_1 create a primitive Pythagorean triple.\nformula_1 and formula_1 create a primitive Pythagorean triple. The values satisfy all four conditions. formula_1, formula_1 and formula_1, so the triple formula_1 is created.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Side","surface_form":"side","offset":89},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":106},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":127},{"uri":"Right_triangle","surface_form":"right triangle","offset":139},{"uri":"Degree_(geometry)","surface_form":"degrees","offset":176},{"uri":"Right_angle","surface_form":"right angle","offset":203},{"uri":"Hypotenuse","surface_form":"hypotenuse","offset":307},{"uri":"Mathematical_proof","surface_form":"proof","offset":559},{"uri":"Eudoxus_of_Cnidus","surface_form":"Eudoxus of Cnidus","offset":628},{"uri":"Similar","surface_form":"similar","offset":739}]}
