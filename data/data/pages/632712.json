{"id":632712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido","text":"e=\"preserve\">Libido is a person's 'sex drive'. A person's overall sexual drive (desire for sexual activity) varies greatly. Someone with a libido is called an \"allosexual\". Someone without it is called \"asexual\".\nSex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Sex hormones like\ntestosterone, and neurotransmitters like dopamine affect the libido. Both of these work on a brain nucleus called the \"nucleus accumbens\" (one in each half of the brain). These centres work on motivation, learning, and reinforcement.\nSocial factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, such as personality and stress, can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medication, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g. puberty).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_activity","surface_form":"sexual activity","offset":91},{"uri":"Biological","surface_form":"biological","offset":240},{"uri":"Psychological","surface_form":"psychological","offset":252},{"uri":"Sex_hormone","surface_form":"Sex hormone","offset":286},{"uri":"Testosterone","surface_form":"testosterone","offset":304},{"uri":"Neurotransmitter","surface_form":"neurotransmitter","offset":322},{"uri":"Dopamine","surface_form":"dopamine","offset":345},{"uri":"Nucleus_(brain)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":403},{"uri":"Motivation","surface_form":"motivation","offset":497},{"uri":"Learning","surface_form":"learning","offset":509},{"uri":"Reinforcement","surface_form":"reinforcement","offset":523},{"uri":"Personality","surface_form":"personality","offset":623},{"uri":"Stress_(biology)","surface_form":"stress","offset":639},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"medication","offset":720},{"uri":"Lifestyle","surface_form":"lifestyle","offset":732},{"uri":"Intimacy","surface_form":"relationship","offset":746},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":781}]}
