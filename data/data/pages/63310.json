{"id":63310,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction","text":"Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property. Industrial construction, though a relatively small part of the entire construction industry, is a very important component.\nHistory.\nThe first buildings were huts and shelters, constructed by hand or with simple tools. As cities grew during the Bronze Age, a class of professional craftsmen appeared. Occasionally, slaves were used for construction work. In the Middle Ages, these were organized into guilds. In the 19th century, steam-powered machinery appeared, and later diesel- and electric powered vehicles such as cranes, excavators and bulldozers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Real_property","surface_form":"real property","offset":60},{"uri":"Shelter","surface_form":"shelter","offset":242},{"uri":"Cities","surface_form":"cities","offset":297},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":320},{"uri":"Slaves","surface_form":"slaves","offset":390},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":437},{"uri":"Machinery","surface_form":"machinery","offset":519},{"uri":"Diesel","surface_form":"diesel","offset":549},{"uri":"Electric","surface_form":"electric","offset":561},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":578},{"uri":"Crane_(machine)","surface_form":"cranes","offset":595}]}
