{"id":633155,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland-Lloyd_Dinosaur_Quarry","text":"The Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry is well known for having the densest concentration of Jurassic dinosaur fossils ever found. It is a paleontological site near Cleveland, Utah. The quarry is in a part of the geological layers known as the Morrison Formation.\nWell over 15,000 bones have been excavated from this Jurassic excavation site. There are many thousands more awaiting excavation and study. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in October 1965.\nAll of these bones, belonging to different species, are found disarticulated and mixed together. Perhaps this strong concentration of mixed fossilised bones is due to a \"predator trap\". No scientific consensus has been reached yet and debates continue to the present day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":90},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":99},{"uri":"Cleveland%2C_Utah","surface_form":"Cleveland, Utah","offset":162},{"uri":"Quarry","surface_form":"quarry","offset":183},{"uri":"Stratum","surface_form":"geological layers","offset":210},{"uri":"Morrison_Formation","surface_form":"Morrison Formation","offset":241},{"uri":"National_Natural_Landmark","surface_form":"National Natural Landmark","offset":421},{"uri":"Articulation","surface_form":"disarticulated","offset":526},{"uri":"Predator_trap","surface_form":"predator trap","offset":634},{"uri":"Consensus","surface_form":"consensus","offset":664}]}
