The central figure is called \"Vajra\u2010p\u0101ni\" which means a vajra-carrier or a vajra-master.\nThe Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra was the secret gathering based on thought that having sexual relations with many women would contribute to Buddhism awakening. The legitimate wives of the vajra\u2010sattva\u1E25a, called \"dakinis\", were limited only to virgins. Although the number of dakinis is variously drafted according to the literature, it probably amounts to a number of geometrical progressionwise.\nAlso statues and pictures were made to beautify the method. However, because those acts had no integrity to fundamental buddhist precepts, it is no longer done in Tibetan Buddhism. On the contrary, warning symbols and festivals, such as Citipati, are widely spread.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":20},{"uri":"Tibetan_people","surface_form":"Tibetan","offset":49},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":81},{"uri":"Tantra","surface_form":"tantra","offset":129},{"uri":"Tibetan_Buddhism","surface_form":"Tibetan Buddhism","offset":146},{"uri":"Vajrayana","surface_form":"Vajra","offset":194},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":383},{"uri":"Dakini","surface_form":"dakini","offset":455},{"uri":"Virgin","surface_form":"virgin","offset":486},{"uri":"Geometrical_progression","surface_form":"geometrical progression","offset":611},{"uri":"Citipati_(Buddhism)","surface_form":"Citipati","offset":877}]}
