{"id":63320,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_property","text":"e=\"preserve\">In chemistry, a property is any aspect of a substance which is only seen by means of a chemical reaction. Simply speaking, chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance. This is different from a physical property, which can be discovered without changing the substance's chemical structure.\nUsually a chemical property is discovered by changing the substance's internal structure. When a substance goes under a chemical reaction, the properties will change drastically, resulting in chemical change. However, a catalytic property would also be a chemical property.\nChemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications. They can be used to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":16},{"uri":"Chemical_substance","surface_form":"substance","offset":57},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":100},{"uri":"Physical_property","surface_form":"physical property","offset":245},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":330},{"uri":"Catalytic","surface_form":"catalytic","offset":561}]}
