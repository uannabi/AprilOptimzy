{"id":63322,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit","text":"A drum kit (or drum set or trap set) is a collection of drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments that is used by a drummer in a musical group.\nSetup.\nOther cymbals and drums can be added to the setup for a wider range of sounds like the Splash, a small cymbal around 10\"/25\u00A0cm giving a distinct crash sound with a quick decay, or a China cymbal, that gives an \"oriental feel\" to beats, rhythms, solos and fills. The latter is much like a crash cymbal popped inside out with the screw and sponge holding it to the stand inside it, so it has a shallow bowl shape.\nThe drummer can do other things to the kit, such as attach a tambourine to the spine of the hi-hat, so when he/she puts his/her foot down on the pedal or hits it with a drumstick, the drummer gets the tambourine sound at the same time. Cymbals can also have rivets inserted into them to give them a 'sizzling' sound, or a cowbell can be attached to the top of the bass drum between the snare and floor tom to use in fills, solos, grooves, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drum","offset":56},{"uri":"Cymbal","surface_form":"cymbal","offset":63},{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion instrument","offset":82},{"uri":"Drummer","surface_form":"drummer","offset":123},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"musical group","offset":136}]}
