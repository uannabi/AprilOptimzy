Other parts can be filled with patterns of leaves, grapes or knots. Sometimes it has a ledge at the top with saints' or characters from the bible.\nMuch of the time a khachkar is put up for religious reasons such as the salvation of the soul of a living or a dead person. They have also been removed for other reasons, such as to show a military win, building of a new church, or as a protection from natural disasters.\nMost Khachkars are in graveyards. But Armenian gravestones take many other forms, and only a small are khatchkars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Armenian_language","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":37},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":121},{"uri":"Salvation","surface_form":"salvation","offset":416},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":533},{"uri":"Cemetery","surface_form":"graveyards","offset":638}]}
