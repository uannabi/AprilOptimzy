{"id":63330,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udon","text":"is a type of thick, wheat-based noodle popular in Japanese cuisine.\nUdon is most often served hot as a noodle soup in a mild, salty broth. Its simplest form is called \"kake udon\". This consists only of dashi stock, soy sauce (\"sh\u014Dyu\"), mirin, and \"udon\" noodles. Different things can be put on top of the soup as toppings. Often thinly cut scallions are used, along with other common toppings such as kamaboko, prawn or vegetable tempura, some spices, and wakame.\nThe flavor of the broth and toppings, as well as even noodle texture and thickness, is different from region to region. Usually, dark brown broth made from dark soy sauce (\"koikuchi sh\u014Dyu\") is common in eastern Japan. Light brown broth made from light soy sauce (\"usukuchi sh\u014Dyu\") is common in western Japan. However, many other regional types exist outside of just broth color and mainly vary in toppings used.\nKagawa Prefecture is famous for using udon as a staple food.\nDefinition.\nAccording to JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standard), to be udon, a round noodle's diameter has to be over 1.7\u00A0mm and a flat noodle's width over 1.7\u00A0mm. Udon dough is made from wheat flour and salt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":20},{"uri":"Noodle","surface_form":"noodle","offset":32},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":50},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":59},{"uri":"Noodle_soup","surface_form":"noodle soup","offset":103},{"uri":"Broth","surface_form":"broth","offset":132},{"uri":"Dashi","surface_form":"dashi","offset":202},{"uri":"Soy_sauce","surface_form":"soy sauce","offset":215},{"uri":"Mirin","surface_form":"mirin","offset":236},{"uri":"Scallion","surface_form":"scallion","offset":340},{"uri":"Kamaboko","surface_form":"kamaboko","offset":401},{"uri":"Tempura","surface_form":"tempura","offset":430},{"uri":"Wakame","surface_form":"wakame","offset":456},{"uri":"Soy_sauce","surface_form":"soy sauce","offset":625},{"uri":"Kagawa_Prefecture","surface_form":"Kagawa Prefecture","offset":876},{"uri":"Staple_food","surface_form":"staple food","offset":924},{"uri":"Wheat_flour","surface_form":"wheat flour","offset":1123}]}
