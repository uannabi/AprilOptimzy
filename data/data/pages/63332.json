For a short period of time, a castle, Hachi\u014Dji Castle (\u516B\u738B\u5B50\u57CE; Hachi\u014Dji-j\u014D) was in the area. It was made in 1584 by H\u014Dj\u014D Ujiteru (\u5317\u6761\u6C0F\u7167), but was soon broken in war by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590. In the Meiji period, Hachi\u014Dji grew larger because of silk and silk textiles. However, the industry became less popular in the 1960s. Today, Hachi\u014Dji is home for many Tokyo workers.\nIn Hachioji, there are about 20 colleges and universities, including Takushoku University.\nGeography.\nThere are 3 mountains around Hachioji.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":19},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":28},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":53},{"uri":"Special_wards_of_Tokyo","surface_form":"23 special wards","offset":116},{"uri":"Edo_period","surface_form":"Edo period","offset":497},{"uri":"Toyotomi_Hideyoshi","surface_form":"Toyotomi Hideyoshi","offset":674},{"uri":"Meiji_period","surface_form":"Meiji period","offset":709},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":915},{"uri":"Universities","surface_form":"universities","offset":928},{"uri":"Takushoku_University","surface_form":"Takushoku University","offset":952}]}
