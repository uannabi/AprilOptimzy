{"id":633477,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfie_Evans_case","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Alfie Evans case was a legal case in 2018 involving Alfie Evans (9 May 2016 \u2013 28 April 2018), a baby boy from Liverpool with an undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder.\nThe medical team and the child's parents disagreed about whether to keep Evans' life support or to remove it, resulting in a legal battle.\nOn 19 December 2017, Alder Hey applied to the High Court to withdraw parental rights from Alfie's parents and to withdraw ventilation. The High Court ruled in favour of the hospital on 20 February 2018.\nThe ventilatory support was removed on 23 April 2018 following a series of unsuccessful appeals from Alfie's family. Alfie continued to breathe naturally after the removal of his breathing tube. He died on 28 April 2018 at the age of 1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":127},{"uri":"Neurodegeneration","surface_form":"neurodegenerative disorder","offset":157},{"uri":"Life_support","surface_form":"life support","offset":265},{"uri":"High_Court_of_Justice","surface_form":"High Court","offset":370}]}
