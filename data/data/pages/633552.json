{"id":633552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte","text":"A myocyte (also known as a muscle cell) is the type of cell found in muscle tissue.\nMyocytes are long, tubular cells. They develop from myoblasts to form muscles in a process called myogenesis.\nThere are various specialized forms of myocytes: cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. They have different structures. The striated or striped cells of cardiac and skeletal muscles are called muscle fibers.\nCardiomyocytes are the muscle fibres which form the chambers of the heart. They have a single central nucleus. Skeletal muscle fibers help support and move the body. They usually have peripheral nuclei.\nSmooth muscle cells control involuntary movements such as the peristalsis contractions in the oesophagus and stomach.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cell","offset":55},{"uri":"Muscle_tissue","surface_form":"muscle tissue","offset":69},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":154},{"uri":"Cardiac_muscle","surface_form":"cardiac","offset":243},{"uri":"Skeletal_muscle","surface_form":"skeletal","offset":252},{"uri":"Smooth_muscle","surface_form":"smooth muscle","offset":266},{"uri":"Cardiomyocytes","surface_form":"Cardiomyocytes","offset":407},{"uri":"Skeletal_muscle","surface_form":"Skeletal muscle","offset":518},{"uri":"Smooth_muscle","surface_form":"Smooth muscle","offset":610},{"uri":"Peristalsis","surface_form":"peristalsis","offset":672},{"uri":"Oesophagus","surface_form":"oesophagus","offset":704},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":719}]}
