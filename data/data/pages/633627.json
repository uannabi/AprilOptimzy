He has been the President of Togo since 2005. Before his election, he was appointed by his father, President Gnassingb\u00E9 Eyad\u00E9ma, as a Minister from 2003 to 2005.\nIn the April 2015 presidential election, Gnassingb\u00E9 won a third term, defeating his main challenger, Jean-Pierre Fabre, by a margin of about 59% to 35%, according to official results. Many Togolese are tired of the Gnassingb\u00E9s ruling Togo and have been protesting against his government. They say that France, which used to run Togo as part of its empire, put the family in power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Togo","surface_form":"Togo","offset":61},{"uri":"List_of_Presidents_of_Togo","surface_form":"President of Togo","offset":98},{"uri":"Gnassingb%C3%A9_Eyad%C3%A9ma","surface_form":"Gnassingb\u00E9 Eyad\u00E9ma","offset":191},{"uri":"Togolese_presidential_election%2C_2015","surface_form":"April 2015 presidential election","offset":251},{"uri":"Jean-Pierre_Fabre","surface_form":"Jean-Pierre Fabre","offset":345},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protesting","offset":497},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":546},{"uri":"French_colonial_empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":592}]}
