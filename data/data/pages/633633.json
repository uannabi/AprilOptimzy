Like many regional African wars during the late twentieth century, the Mozambican Civil War was affected by the Cold War politics. The war was fought between Mozambique's ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) and insurgent forces of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO).\nhe Mozambican Civil War destroyed much of Mozambique's rural infrastructure, including hospitals, rail lines, roads, and schools. FRELIMO's security forces and RENAMO insurgents were accused of committing numerous human rights abuses, including using child soldiers and salting a significant percentage of the countryside indiscriminately with land mines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civil_war","surface_form":"civil war","offset":44},{"uri":"Mozambique","surface_form":"Mozambique","offset":64},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":206},{"uri":"Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Mozambique","surface_form":"Front for the Liberation of Mozambique","offset":272},{"uri":"Mozambican_National_Resistance","surface_form":"Mozambican National Resistance","offset":349},{"uri":"Child_soldier","surface_form":"child soldier","offset":641},{"uri":"Land_mine","surface_form":"land mine","offset":734}]}
