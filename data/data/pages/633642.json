Users may also optionally register a free Pornhub account, which additionally allows them to post comments, download videos and add videos to their favourites, as well as upload videos themselves.\nSince 2012, Pornhub has hosted several events and campaigns to raise awareness of certain issues or raise money, as well as to help promote their brand.\nIn March 2010, Pornhub was bought by Manwin (now known as MindGeek), which owns numerous other pornographic websites.\nThe website was blocked by the Great Firewall in China from September 2013.\nOn March 12, 2014, Pornhub was blocked in Russia because one actress looked too young, leading some viewers to think she was a minor.\nOn January 2017, Pornhub was blocked in the Philippines. Pornhub and similar pornography websites were blocked in order to comply with (follow) the Anti-Child Pornography Law.\nPornhub was blocked in September 2016 in Russia due to \"spreading harmful information to children\".

Now, Russian users must provide their cellphone numbers or passports to access Pornhub.\nIn October 2018, the Uttarakhand High Court re-banned Pornhub in India, enforced by blocks from internet providers of India.
