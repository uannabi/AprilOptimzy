{"id":63367,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odonata","text":"The Odonata are an order of flying insects, the dragonflies and damselflies.\nLike most of the flying insects (flies, beetles, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera), they evolved in the early Mesozoic era. Their prototypes, the giant dragonflies of the Carboniferous, 325 mya, are no longer put in the Odonata. These are now called Protodonata or Meganisoptera.\nAll Odonata have aquatic larvae called 'nymphs', and all of them, larvae and adults, are carnivorous. The adults can land, but rarely walk. Their legs are specialised for catching prey. They are almost entirely insectivorous.\nDescription.\nThese insects characteristically have large rounded heads covered mostly by big compound eyes, legs that catch prey (other insects) in flight, two pairs of long, transparent wings that move independently, and long abdomens. They have two ocelli (eye spots) and short antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include simple chewing mandibles in the adult.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":19},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":35},{"uri":"Dragonflies","surface_form":"dragonflies","offset":48},{"uri":"Damselfly","surface_form":"damselflies","offset":64},{"uri":"Diptera","surface_form":"flies","offset":110},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":117},{"uri":"Lepidoptera","surface_form":"Lepidoptera","offset":126},{"uri":"Hymenoptera","surface_form":"Hymenoptera","offset":142},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":182},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":243},{"uri":"Protodonata","surface_form":"Protodonata","offset":322},{"uri":"Aquatic","surface_form":"aquatic","offset":369},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":377},{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":441},{"uri":"Insectivorous","surface_form":"insectivorous","offset":563},{"uri":"Compound_eye","surface_form":"compound eye","offset":671},{"uri":"Abdomen","surface_form":"abdomen","offset":805},{"uri":"Ocelli","surface_form":"ocelli","offset":829},{"uri":"Antenna_(biology)","surface_form":"antennae","offset":858},{"uri":"Mandible","surface_form":"mandible","offset":943}]}
