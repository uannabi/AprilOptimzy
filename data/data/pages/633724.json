{"id":633724,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design","text":"Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer software to help create, change, analyse or optimize designs. It is meant to help the designer create better quality, more precise, and neater designs. It also helps improve communication of the design by creating documentation for it as well as a database for manufacturing. CAD is used in many places such as architecture and product design.\nDesigning using CAD can take longer than the traditional way of drawing on paper and costs more because of the software. Also, people often need to be trained to understand CAD.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_software","surface_form":"computer software","offset":42},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":104},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":225},{"uri":"Documentation","surface_form":"documentation","offset":265},{"uri":"Database","surface_form":"database","offset":299},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":312},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":362},{"uri":"Product_(business)","surface_form":"product design","offset":379},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":470},{"uri":"Training","surface_form":"trained","offset":546}]}
