{"id":633758,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmabunt%C3%BCs","text":"Emmabunt\u00FCs is a Linux distribution derived from Ubuntu/Debian and designed to facilitate the repacking of computers donated to humanitarian organizations like the Emma\u00FCs Communities.\nThe name Emmabunt\u00FCs is a portmanteau of Emma\u00FCs and Ubuntu.\nFeatures.\nEmmabunt\u00FCs can be installed, in its entirety, without an Internet connection as all of the required packages are included within the disk image. The disk image includes packages for multiple languages and also optional non-free codecs that the user can choose whether to install or not.\nEmmabunt\u00FCs was developed to function correctly on 10 years old computers, which were previously running Windows XP or more up-to-date Windows versions, and equipped with a minimum of 1 Gigabyte of RAM for the 32 bits versions. This allows associations like YovoTogo & JUMP Lab'Orione to recycle computers in order to equip high schools in Togo, or the Emmabunt\u00FCs collective to equip kindergarten and elementary schools in the Paris area.\nDesktop environment.\nThe desktop environment is Xfce with Cairo-Dock. LXDE is also included and can be optionally installed.\nApplications.\nMultiple applications are installed that perform the same task in order to provide a choice for each user that uses the system.\nEmmanunt\u00FCs also includes educational software like Gcompris, TuxPaint, TuxMath, TuxType, Scratch, etc. It also contains Kiwix, an off-line Wikipedia reader allowing Emmabunt\u00FCs to become an self-contained (without Internet access) Free Culture Server, including Wikis like Vikidia, or books in the ePub format.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linux_distribution","surface_form":"Linux distribution","offset":16},{"uri":"Ubuntu","surface_form":"Ubuntu","offset":48},{"uri":"Debian","surface_form":"Debian","offset":55},{"uri":"Computers","surface_form":"computers","offset":106},{"uri":"Humanitarian_aid","surface_form":"humanitarian organizations","offset":127},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":309},{"uri":"Disk_image","surface_form":"disk image","offset":385},{"uri":"Windows_XP","surface_form":"Windows XP","offset":643},{"uri":"RAM","surface_form":"RAM","offset":736},{"uri":"Recycle","surface_form":"recycle","offset":826},{"uri":"Kindergarten","surface_form":"kindergarten","offset":922},{"uri":"Primary_school","surface_form":"elementary schools","offset":939},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":965},{"uri":"Desktop_environment","surface_form":"desktop environment","offset":1002},{"uri":"Xfce","surface_form":"Xfce","offset":1025},{"uri":"LXDE","surface_form":"LXDE","offset":1047},{"uri":"Gcompris","surface_form":"Gcompris","offset":1295},{"uri":"TuxPaint","surface_form":"TuxPaint","offset":1305},{"uri":"TuxMath","surface_form":"TuxMath","offset":1315},{"uri":"TuxType","surface_form":"TuxType","offset":1324},{"uri":"Scratch_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Scratch","offset":1333},{"uri":"Online_and_offline","surface_form":"off-line","offset":1374},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":1383},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"Server","offset":1487},{"uri":"Vikidia","surface_form":"Vikidia","offset":1516},{"uri":"EPub","surface_form":"ePub","offset":1541}]}
