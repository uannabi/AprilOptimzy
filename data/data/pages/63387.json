{"id":63387,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling","text":"Professional wrestling, pro wrestling is wrestling done as performance art. It is different from other sports because it is a fixed sport. It is sometimes known as sports entertainment.\nLike other athletes, most wrestlers train each day to maintain their physical condition. They practice for years to learn to execute moves safely while still making them look dangerous. They suffer many injuries, sometimes severe.\nProfessional wrestling is done as a show, like a play. Many wrestlers will wrestle in many fights, called matches. They wrestle inside a 'wrestling ring', which is a place with ropes around it. The best wrestlers can win belts, called 'championship titles', to show that they are the best.\nFamous stars of the ring include \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Andr\u00E9 the Giant, Sting, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Mick Foley, Stone Cold Steve Austin and John Cena.\nThe United States, Canada, Mexico, and Japan and the United Kingdom are countries that have a lot of professional wrestling events. The biggest company of professional wrestling is WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment). Once a year, they have a big wrestling event called WrestleMania. Professional wrestling can be seen both in the audience of an arena or on television.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wrestling","surface_form":"wrestling","offset":41},{"uri":"Performance_art","surface_form":"performance art","offset":59},{"uri":"Sports","surface_form":"sports","offset":103},{"uri":"Fixed","surface_form":"fixed","offset":126},{"uri":"Show","surface_form":"show","offset":453},{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":466},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":594},{"uri":"Belt","surface_form":"belt","offset":638},{"uri":"Ric_Flair","surface_form":"Ric Flair","offset":766},{"uri":"Hulk_Hogan","surface_form":"Hulk Hogan","offset":777},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_the_Giant","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 the Giant","offset":789},{"uri":"Sting_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Sting","offset":806},{"uri":"Randy_Savage","surface_form":"\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage","offset":813},{"uri":"Bret_Hart","surface_form":"Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart","offset":839},{"uri":"Shawn_Michaels","surface_form":"Shawn Michaels","offset":863},{"uri":"The_Undertaker","surface_form":"The Undertaker","offset":879},{"uri":"Triple_H","surface_form":"Triple H","offset":895},{"uri":"Brock_Lesnar","surface_form":"Brock Lesnar","offset":905},{"uri":"Bill_Goldberg","surface_form":"Goldberg","offset":919},{"uri":"Mick_Foley","surface_form":"Mick Foley","offset":929},{"uri":"Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin","surface_form":"Stone Cold Steve Austin","offset":941},{"uri":"John_Cena","surface_form":"John Cena","offset":969},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":984},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":999},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1007},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1019},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1033},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":1052},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":1124},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":1161},{"uri":"WrestleMania","surface_form":"WrestleMania","offset":1250},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":1311},{"uri":"Arena","surface_form":"arena","offset":1326},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":1338}]}
