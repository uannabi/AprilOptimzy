{"id":634017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAD/CAM","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term CAD/CAM is a shortening of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacture (CAM). The term CAD/NC (Numerical Control) is equivalent in some industries. Most CAD/CAM software was developed for product development and to design and manufacture of components and molds. They are also increasingly used by architects. CAD/CAM software uses CAD drawing tools to describe geometries used by the CAM portion of the program to define a toolpath that will direct the motion of a machine tool to machine the exact shape that was drawn.\nExamples of CAD/CAM software are SolidWorks, INVENTOR, CATiA and AutoCAD. Furthermore, examples of CAM software are SolidCAM and CAMWorks.\n3D CAD/CAM software provides the ability to control CNC machinery from 2.5 axis, 3 axis and multi axis CNC machines.\nExpert CAD/CAM systems were developed around 1988.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer-aided_design_(CAD)","surface_form":"Computer-Aided Design (CAD)","offset":49},{"uri":"Computer-aided_manufacture_(CAM)","surface_form":"Computer-Aided Manufacture (CAM)","offset":81},{"uri":"Numerical_control","surface_form":"Numerical Control","offset":132},{"uri":"Architects","surface_form":"architects","offset":335}]}
