{"id":634136,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alstom_Metropolis_C830C","text":"The Alstom Metropolis C830C, together with the Alstom Metropolis C751C are the third generation of communications-based train control (CBTC) rolling stock to be used in Singapore\u2019s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) lines. 24 trainsets of 3 cars were manufactured by Shanghai Alstom Transport Co Ltd (a joint venture between Alstom and Shanghai Electric), with deliveries from end June 2014.\nTender.\nThe tender for trains under the contract 830C was opened together with another contract C751C for an additional 18 North East Line trains which closed on 18 July 2011 with 5 bids. The Land Transport Authority has shortlisted all of them and the tender results was published on 1 February 2012.\nDesign.\nThe outside of the train is almost the same as the older C830, with slight differences such as a larger SMRT logo and the look of the train inside. The reserved seats are coloured red to make them more obvious. Navy blue and yellow coloured seats are installed in the driving motor cars (end carriages) while the seats in the middle car are khaki. The train's system that allows it to move is louder than the C830's, and is identical the one found on the Amsterdam Metro M5 Series.\nOther changes include the inner layer of the doors finished in bluish-grey, a new Visual Passenger Information System, similar to the C951, located above the doors and a new gangway design similar to the C751C.\nDriverless operation.\nThe C830C runs without a driver, using Communications-based train control (CBTC), which does not require \"fixed-block track circuits\" to find where the train is on the track. Instead, they use \"continuous two-way digital communication\" between each controlled train and a control center, which may control an area of a railroad line, a complete line, or a group of lines. It has been found that CBTC systems reduce costs for running the system and allow the system to be controlled more easily.\nTrain Formation.\nThe configuration of a C830C in revenue service is Mc1-T-Mc2\nThe car numbers of the trains range from 841x to 864x, where x depends on the carriage type. Individual cars are assigned a 4 digit serial number. A complete three-car trainset consists of one trailer(T) and two driving motor cars(Mc1 & Mc2) permanently coupled together. For example, set 864 consists of carriages 8641, 8642, 8643.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communications-based_train_control","surface_form":"communications-based train control","offset":99},{"uri":"Rolling_stock","surface_form":"rolling stock","offset":141},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":169},{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Mass Rapid Transit","offset":181},{"uri":"North_East_MRT_Line","surface_form":"North East Line","offset":505},{"uri":"Land_Transport_Authority","surface_form":"Land Transport Authority","offset":574},{"uri":"Navy_blue","surface_form":"Navy blue","offset":903},{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":917}]}
