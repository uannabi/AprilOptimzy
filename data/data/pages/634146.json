{"id":634146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Meselson","text":"Matthew Stanley Meselson (born May 24, 1930) is a geneticist and molecular biologist at Harvard University. He is known for his demonstration, with Franklin Stahl, of the semi-conservative DNA replication.\nAfter completing his Ph.D under Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology, Meselson became a Professor at Harvard University in 1960. He is there today as today as Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences.\nIn the famous Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment of 1958 he and Frank Stahl showed with nitrogen isotope labeling that DNA is replicated semi-conservatively. In addition, Meselson, Fran\u00E7ois Jacob, and Sydney Brenner discovered the existence of messenger RNA in 1961. Meselson has investigated DNA repair in cells and how cells recognize and destroy foreign DNA, and, with Werner Arber, was responsible for the discovery of restriction enzymes.\nSince 1963 he has been interested in chemical warfare and biological defense and arms control. Meselson worked with Henry Kissinger under the Nixon administration to convince President Richard Nixon to renounce biological weapons, suspend chemical weapons production, and support an international treaty banning biological agents for hostile purposes. In 1972 this became the Biological Weapons Convention.\nMeselson has received many awards. His laboratory at Harvard investigates the biological and evolutionary nature of sexual reproduction, genetic recombination, and aging. Many of his past students are notable biologists, including Nobel Laureate Sidney Altman, Mark Ptashne, Susan Lindquist, Stephen F. Heinemann, and Richard I. Morimoto.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geneticist","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":50},{"uri":"Molecular_biologist","surface_form":"molecular biologist","offset":65},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":88},{"uri":"Franklin_Stahl","surface_form":"Franklin Stahl","offset":148},{"uri":"Semiconservative_replication","surface_form":"semi-conservative","offset":171},{"uri":"DNA_replication","surface_form":"DNA replication","offset":189},{"uri":"Linus_Pauling","surface_form":"Linus Pauling","offset":238},{"uri":"California_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"California Institute of Technology","offset":259},{"uri":"Meselson%E2%80%93Stahl_experiment","surface_form":"Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment","offset":453},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":527},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Jacob","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois Jacob","offset":611},{"uri":"Sydney_Brenner","surface_form":"Sydney Brenner","offset":631},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":674},{"uri":"Werner_Arber","surface_form":"Werner Arber","offset":802},{"uri":"Restriction_enzymes","surface_form":"restriction enzymes","offset":853},{"uri":"Chemical_warfare","surface_form":"chemical warfare","offset":911},{"uri":"Biological_weapon","surface_form":"biological","offset":932},{"uri":"Henry_Kissinger","surface_form":"Henry Kissinger","offset":990},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":1059},{"uri":"Biological_Weapons_Convention","surface_form":"Biological Weapons Convention","offset":1250},{"uri":"Evolutionary","surface_form":"evolutionary","offset":1374},{"uri":"Sexual_reproduction","surface_form":"sexual reproduction","offset":1397},{"uri":"Genetic_recombination","surface_form":"genetic recombination","offset":1418},{"uri":"Aging","surface_form":"aging","offset":1445},{"uri":"Nobel_Laureate","surface_form":"Nobel Laureate","offset":1512},{"uri":"Sidney_Altman","surface_form":"Sidney Altman","offset":1527},{"uri":"Mark_Ptashne","surface_form":"Mark Ptashne","offset":1542},{"uri":"Susan_Lindquist","surface_form":"Susan Lindquist","offset":1556},{"uri":"Stephen_F._Heinemann","surface_form":"Stephen F.
