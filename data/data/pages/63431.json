{"id":63431,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fume_hood","text":"A fume hood or fume cupboard is a large piece of scientific equipment common to chemistry laboratories. Fume hoods stop a person coming into contact with hazardous fumes. They contain an air pump that sucks fumes away from the person using them.\nFume hoods have a large glass window that is opened when a scientist needs to get inside. The window protects the scientist from splashes of chemicals or explosions that could harm them. Most chemical reactions are done inside a fume hood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scientific","surface_form":"scientific","offset":49},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":80},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":305},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":387},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explosion","offset":400},{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":438}]}
