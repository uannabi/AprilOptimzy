They migrated from Beringia into Alaska\u00A0 sometime before 11,500 years ago. They separated from other Paleo-Indians about 20,000 years ago. The discovery of an \"Ancient Beringian\" genome from the remains of two infants dated to 11,500 years ago was announced in January 2018.\nThe Ancient Beringians remained in the Arctic until they either became extinct or amalgamated with the Dene about five to six thousand years ago.\nThe Ancient Beringian were hunter-gatherers.\u00A0 They ate wild plants and wild animals. Some of the animals they ate were salmon, ptarmigan, and ground squirrels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beringia","surface_form":"Beringia","offset":107},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":402},{"uri":"Hunter-gatherer","surface_form":"hunter-gatherers","offset":536},{"uri":"Salmon","surface_form":"salmon","offset":628}]}
