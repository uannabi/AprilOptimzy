He became the Director of the Acad\u00E9mie des Sciences, and the first President of the Prussian Academy of Science, at the invitation of Frederick the Great.\nMaupertuis made an expedition to Lapland to determine the shape of the Earth. He is often credited with having invented the principle of least action; a version is known as Maupertuis's principle \u2013 an integral equation that determines the path followed by a physical system. His work in natural history is interesting in relation to modern science, since he touched on aspects of heredity and the struggle for life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Man_of_letters","surface_form":"man of letters","offset":116},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie des Sciences","offset":162},{"uri":"Prussian_Academy_of_Science","surface_form":"Prussian Academy of Science","offset":216},{"uri":"Frederick_the_Great","surface_form":"Frederick the Great","offset":266},{"uri":"Lapland_(region)","surface_form":"Lapland","offset":320},{"uri":"Principle_of_least_action","surface_form":"principle of least action","offset":411},{"uri":"Maupertuis%27s_principle","surface_form":"Maupertuis's principle","offset":460},{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"natural history","offset":574},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"heredity","offset":667},{"uri":"Struggle_for_life","surface_form":"struggle for life","offset":684}]}
