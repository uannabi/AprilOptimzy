{"id":634705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnosaurus","text":"\"Magnosaurus\" (meaning 'large lizard') was a theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of England. The main species, \"Magnosaurus nethercombensis\" has poorly preserved remains. It has often been confused with or included in \"Megalosaurus\".\nIn 1923, German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene named \"Megalosaurus nethercombensis\" from a partial skeleton. It was found in the nineteenth century by W. Parker in Dorset. Fossils came from a possible juvenile individual. Huene interpreted it as a more primitive species of \"Megalosaurus\".\nThe remains are just a few fragments. Details of its anatomical features are unknown. It would have been a bipedal carnivore of moderate size for a dinosaur.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":45},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":54},{"uri":"Middle_Jurassic","surface_form":"Middle Jurassic","offset":72},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":91},{"uri":"Megalosaurus","surface_form":"Megalosaurus","offset":226},{"uri":"German","surface_form":"German","offset":250},{"uri":"Friedrich_von_Huene","surface_form":"Friedrich von Huene","offset":272},{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":409},{"uri":"Juvenile_(organism)","surface_form":"juvenile","offset":446},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":508},{"uri":"Megalosaurus","surface_form":"Megalosaurus","offset":520},{"uri":"Bipedal","surface_form":"bipedal","offset":642},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivore","offset":650}]}
