{"id":63472,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urartian_language","text":"Urartian is the name for the language spoken by the people of the ancient kingdom of Urartu in northeast Anatolia (present-day Turkey), in the region of Lake Van.\nUrartian was a language isolate, which was neither Semitic nor Indo-European, but a member of the Hurro-Urartian family.\nThere is a hypothesis that suggests that besides the cuneiform inscriptions of the Urartian language, Urartu had a native hieroglyphic writing system. Armenian scientist Artak Movsisyan published a partial attempt deciphering of Urartian hieroglyphs, saying that they were written in an early form of Armenian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":29},{"uri":"Urartu","surface_form":"Urartu","offset":85},{"uri":"Anatolia","surface_form":"Anatolia","offset":105},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":127},{"uri":"Lake_Van","surface_form":"Lake Van","offset":153},{"uri":"Language_isolate","surface_form":"language isolate","offset":178},{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic","offset":214},{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European","offset":226},{"uri":"Hurro-Urartian_languages","surface_form":"Hurro-Urartian","offset":261},{"uri":"Hypothesis","surface_form":"hypothesis","offset":295},{"uri":"Cuneiform","surface_form":"cuneiform","offset":337},{"uri":"Hieroglyph","surface_form":"hieroglyph","offset":406},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"writing system","offset":419},{"uri":"Artak_Movsisyan","surface_form":"Artak Movsisyan","offset":454},{"uri":"Armenian_language","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":585}]}
