{"id":634882,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiemsee","text":"Chiemsee () is a natural freshwater lake in Bavaria, Germany, near Rosenheim. It is often called \"the Bavarian Sea\".\nThe rivers Gro\u00DFache and Prien flow into the lake from the south, and the river Alz flows out towards the north. The Alz flows into the Inn which then merges with the Danube. The Chiemsee is divided into the bigger, north section, in the northeast, called \"Weitsee\", and the \"Inselsee\", in the southwest.\nThe Chiemgau, the region surrounding the Chiemsee, is a famous recreation area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":44},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":53},{"uri":"Rosenheim","surface_form":"Rosenheim","offset":67},{"uri":"Gro%C3%9Fache","surface_form":"Gro\u00DFache","offset":128},{"uri":"Prien_(river)","surface_form":"Prien","offset":141},{"uri":"Alz","surface_form":"Alz","offset":196},{"uri":"Inn_(river)","surface_form":"Inn","offset":252},{"uri":"Danube","surface_form":"Danube","offset":283},{"uri":"Chiemgau","surface_form":"Chiemgau","offset":425}]}
