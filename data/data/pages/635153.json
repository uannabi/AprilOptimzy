{"id":635153,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happisburgh","text":"e=\"preserve\">Happisburgh, pronounced \"Hazeborough\", is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. The village is on the coast, to the east of a north-south road, the B1159. Its population is under 1,000.\nThis small place became a site of national archaeological importance in 2010. Flint tools over 800,000 years old were unearthed. This is the oldest evidence of human occupation anywhere in the UK. In May 2013, a series of early human footprints were discovered on the beach at the site, providing direct evidence of early human activity at the site. Rough seas had eroded the sandy beach. This uncovered some elongated hollows.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":57},{"uri":"Civil_parish","surface_form":"civil parish","offset":69},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":97},{"uri":"Norfolk","surface_form":"Norfolk","offset":107},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":138},{"uri":"Happisburgh_archaeology","surface_form":"a site","offset":246},{"uri":"Archaeological","surface_form":"archaeological","offset":265},{"uri":"Happisburgh_footprints","surface_form":"early human footprints","offset":444}]}
