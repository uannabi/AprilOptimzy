Stickler syndrome affects around 1 in 10,000 people.\nThere are six types of Stickler syndrome known, and each has its own gene.\nSome people may live long and productive lives if the condition is discovered early on.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medical_condition","surface_form":"medical condition","offset":137},{"uri":"Gunnar_B._Stickler","surface_form":"Gunnar B.
