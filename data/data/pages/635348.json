{"id":635348,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solnhofen","text":"Solnhofen is a German town. The town is in the Altm\u00FChl river valley. Its municipality is in the district of Wei\u00DFenburg-Gunzenhausen in the region of Middle Franconia. The region is in Bavaria, Germany.\nThe local area is famous in geology and archaeology for the Solnhofen limestone. This is a very fine-grained limestone from the Upper Jurassic period. It is an exceptionally fine Lagerst\u00E4tte that preserves detailed fossil specimens. Alois Senefelder used specially prepared blocks of the fine Solnhofen limestone for the process of lithography which he invented in 1798. The quarrying of this lithographic limestone later yielded spectacular finds, including \"Archaeopteryx\", commemorated in the bird's full name \"Archaeopteryx lithographica\". All 13 known specimens have come from the Solnhofen area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Altm%C3%BChl","surface_form":"Altm\u00FChl","offset":47},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":73},{"uri":"Wei%C3%9Fenburg-Gunzenhausen","surface_form":"Wei\u00DFenburg-Gunzenhausen","offset":108},{"uri":"Middle_Franconia","surface_form":"Middle Franconia","offset":149},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":184},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":193},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":230},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeology","offset":242},{"uri":"Solnhofen_limestone","surface_form":"Solnhofen limestone","offset":262},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":311},{"uri":"Upper_Jurassic","surface_form":"Upper Jurassic","offset":330},{"uri":"Lagerst%C3%A4tte","surface_form":"Lagerst\u00E4tte","offset":381},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":417},{"uri":"Alois_Senefelder","surface_form":"Alois Senefelder","offset":435},{"uri":"Lithography","surface_form":"lithography","offset":534},{"uri":"Lithographic_limestone","surface_form":"lithographic limestone","offset":595},{"uri":"Archaeopteryx","surface_form":"Archaeopteryx","offset":662}]}
