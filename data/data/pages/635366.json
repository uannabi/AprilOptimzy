{"id":635366,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_Kids_Go%21","text":"PBS Kids Go! was an educational television brand used by PBS for programs intended for older children (6 to 8-year olds), in comparison to the younger targeted PBS Kids. It was broadcast on PBS stations during the afternoon hours on weekdays. It debuted on October 9, 2004, and was discontinued on November 21, 2013.\nHistory.\nPBS Kids Go! programming block was launched in October 2004. With the ending of the PBS Kids network for PBS Kids Sprout in 2005, Kids Go continued on PBS.\nIn April 2006, PBS announced that, in October 2006, a 24-hour digital multicast network called PBS Kids Go! Channel would be launched with additional content. Slated were several programming blocks, an evening Go! family block targeted at both children and their families, a Spanish language-programming block, \"PBS Kids Vayan!\" and a school block. \"KidsWorld Sports\", HIT Entertainment\u2019s \"Wishbone\" reruns and \"Kratts\u2019 Creatures\" were planned as exclusive programs for the network. These exclusive shows plus those from the PBS block would total seven hours of original programming. At this time, PBS planned on adding one or two new series per year. The network was to be fee-based, allowing those stations that subscript to place the network's exclusive programs on their analog channel if they wish. A branded interactive club was also part of the plan, with stations working it into their existing club or starting a new club and branding it how they would like to.\nWith only one third of PBS stations affiliating with the network and half needed on July 6, 2006, the network was withdrawn. PBS left open the possibility to re-offer the network. Stations found that the sliding scale licensing fees were too high for what little exclusive programming they received, especially after spending additional funds for the PBS HD feed.\nOn August 20, 2013, PBS announced that the PBS Kids Go! brand would be cancelled and replaced with new PBS Kids branding. The new branding began two months later on November 21, 2013 with the launch of \"Peg + Cat\". PBS Kids Go! was dropped, as few parents and kids understood what the brand was about.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["programming block"],"annotations":[{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":57},{"uri":"PBS_Kids","surface_form":"PBS Kids","offset":160},{"uri":"Programming_block","surface_form":"programming block","offset":339},{"uri":"Sprout_(TV_network)","surface_form":"PBS Kids Sprout","offset":431},{"uri":"HIT_Entertainment","surface_form":"HIT Entertainment","offset":851},{"uri":"PBS_HD_Channel","surface_form":"PBS HD","offset":1804},{"uri":"Peg_%2B_Cat","surface_form":"Peg + Cat","offset":2020}]}
