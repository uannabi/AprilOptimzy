He spoke no English until he entered school. Although he did not begin playing hockey until age 14, by age 20, a quick-learning Evans was a leading junior league defenceman and participated in the 1948 Memorial Cup. That same year, he signed a minor league contract with the Rangers.

He would then spend the next four years as the Rangers' seventh defenceman, moving in and out of the lineup as needed and serving as a valuable defensive reserve. During the 1954\u201355 NHL season, Evans finally cracked the regular lineup and worked significant minutes for the next three years on the blue line.[https://www.hockey-reference.com/coaches/evansja01c.html] In 1958, he was claimed by Chicago, where he would play in a similar role for his final four seasons. He was a member of the 1961 Stanley Cup winning team. Jack Evans played in 1962 NHL All Star game in Toronto. In 1964, the Blackhawks released Evans, but the veteran continued to play in a variety of minor leagues until he finally retired in 1972 at the age of 44.[http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12560]\nCoaching career.\nIn 1974, Evans was hired to coach the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the WHL. After one season that included coach of the year honors, he was promoted to the parent club California Golden Seals. He coached the anemic franchise in its final year in the Bay Area and its two seasons as the Cleveland Barons before the financially troubled organization merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978 (only later to be reincarnated as the San Jose Sharks).[http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12560]\nEvans returned to the ECHL bench before being hired by the Hartford Whalers in 1983. In his third season with the club, he earned a playoff berth, and in 1987, he led the club to a division title. A poor performance the following year resulted in Evans being fired midseason.\nDeath.\nEvans died of prostate cancer at his Manchester, Connecticut home in 1996 at the age of 68.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":98},{"uri":"Defenceman","surface_form":"defenceman","offset":109},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":159},{"uri":"New_York_Rangers","surface_form":"New York Rangers","offset":190},{"uri":"Chicago_Blackhawks","surface_form":"Chicago Black Hawks","offset":211},{"uri":"Garnant","surface_form":"Garnant","offset":262},{"uri":"Drumheller","surface_form":"Drumheller","offset":312},{"uri":"Memorial_Cup","surface_form":"Memorial Cup","offset":548},{"uri":"American_Hockey_League","surface_form":"American Hockey League","offset":989},{"uri":"1954%E2%80%9355_NHL_season","surface_form":"1954\u201355 NHL season","offset":1187},{"uri":"Stanley_Cup","surface_form":"Stanley Cup","offset":1510},{"uri":"Western_Hockey_League_(1952%E2%80%931974)","surface_form":"WHL","offset":1915},{"uri":"California_Golden_Seals","surface_form":"California Golden Seals","offset":2012},{"uri":"Cleveland_Barons_(NHL)","surface_form":"Cleveland Barons","offset":2130},{"uri":"Minnesota_North_Stars","surface_form":"Minnesota North Stars","offset":2208},{"uri":"San_Jose_Sharks","surface_form":"San Jose Sharks","offset":2276},{"uri":"Hartford_Whalers","surface_form":"Hartford Whalers","offset":2435},{"uri":"Prostate_cancer","surface_form":"prostate cancer","offset":2673},{"uri":"Manchester%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Manchester, Connecticut","offset":2696}]}
