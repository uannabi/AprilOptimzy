{"id":635875,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking","text":"=\"preserve\">Note-taking (or note taking) is recording information taken from another source. By taking notes, the writer records the information, so they don't have to recall everything.\nNotes are usually taken from a transient (temporary) source, such as an oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture or even a passing thought. in these cases the notes may be the only record of the event. Notes of a meeting are usually called minutes.\nNote taking is a form of self discipline.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":54},{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"recall","offset":168},{"uri":"Spoken_language","surface_form":"oral","offset":259},{"uri":"Minutes","surface_form":"minutes","offset":429}]}
