{"id":63609,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saroyan","text":"William Saroyan () (August 31, 1908 - May 18, 1981) was an American author who wrote many plays and short stories about growing up impoverished as the son of Armenian immigrants. These stories were popular during the Great Depression. Saroyan grew up in Fresno, the center of Armenian-Americans in California, where many of his works are set (although he sometimes gave the city a fictional name).\nAsked how to say his name, he told \"The Literary Digest\" \"In Armenian it is \"sor-row'yan\", accent on \"row\". In America it is mispronounced with... 'roy.'\"\nLife.\nSaroyan was born in Fresno, California, the son of an Armenian immigrant. His father moved to New Jersey in 1905 - he was a small vineyard owner, who had been educated as a Presbyterian minister. At a certain point his father was forced to take farm-laboring work, and he died in 1911. At the age of four, William Saroyan was placed in the Fred Finch Orphanage in Oakland, California, together with his brother and sister - an experience he later described in his writing. Five years later the family reunited in Fresno, where his mother, Takoohi, had obtained work in a cannery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":59},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":68},{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":158},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":217},{"uri":"Fresno%2C_California","surface_form":"Fresno","offset":254},{"uri":"Armenian-American","surface_form":"Armenian-American","offset":276},{"uri":"Literary_Digest","surface_form":"Literary Digest","offset":438},{"uri":"Fresno%2C_California","surface_form":"Fresno, California","offset":579},{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":613},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":653}]}
