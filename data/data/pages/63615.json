{"id":63615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador","text":"A Conquistador (English: \"Conqueror\";: \"Conquistadores\", or \"Conquistadors\") was a Spanish soldier, explorer and adventurer. The \"Conquistadors\" invaded and conquered much of the Americas and the Philippines Islands and other islands in Asia Pacific. Many of them were \"hidalgos\" (noblemen of low category).\nTheir conquests brought these lands under Spanish colonial rule between the 15th and 17th centuries, starting with the 1492 settlement by Christopher Columbus in what is now the Bahamas. They created what is now called Latin America.\nThe first immensely successful conquistador was Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s. Between 1520 and 1521, Cort\u00E9s, along with native enemies of the Aztecs, conquered the mighty Aztec Empire. Present day Mexico came under the dominion of the Spanish Empire, as New Spain. Francisco Pizarro later found and conquered the similarly large Inca Empire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":16},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":175},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":196},{"uri":"Noble","surface_form":"noble","offset":281},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":350},{"uri":"15th_century","surface_form":"15th","offset":384},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th","offset":393},{"uri":"1492","surface_form":"1492","offset":427},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":446},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":486},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":527},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":590},{"uri":"1520","surface_form":"1520","offset":613},{"uri":"1521","surface_form":"1521","offset":622},{"uri":"Aztec","surface_form":"Aztec","offset":669},{"uri":"Aztec_Empire","surface_form":"Aztec Empire","offset":698},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":724},{"uri":"Spanish_Empire","surface_form":"Spanish Empire","offset":762},{"uri":"New_Spain","surface_form":"New Spain","offset":781},{"uri":"Francisco_Pizarro","surface_form":"Francisco Pizarro","offset":792},{"uri":"Inca_Empire","surface_form":"Inca Empire","offset":856}]}
