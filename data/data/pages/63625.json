This awakening and enlightenment pushed the reformists to study the Bible. Under the patronage of the Armenian Patriarchate, a school was opened, headed by Krikor Peshdimaljian, one of the leading intellectuals of the time. The principal aim of this school was to train qualified clergy for the Armenian Apostolic Church.\nToday, there are 88 Armenian Evangelical Churches in the following countries: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, England, France, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Uruguay, and the United States of America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Armenian_Language","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":46},{"uri":"Constantinople","surface_form":"Constantinople","offset":162},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":194},{"uri":"Constantinople","surface_form":"Constantinople","offset":258},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":342},{"uri":"Krikor_Peshdimaljian","surface_form":"Krikor Peshdimaljian","offset":430},{"uri":"Armenian_Apostolic_Church","surface_form":"Armenian Apostolic Church","offset":569},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":674},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":685},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":694},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":705},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":714},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":722},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":732},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":740},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":748},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":755},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":764},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":772},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":781},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":789},{"uri":"Lebanon","surface_form":"Lebanon","offset":795},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":804},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":811},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":819},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"United States of America","offset":836}]}
