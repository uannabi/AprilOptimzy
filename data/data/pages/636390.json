They tried to kill her in the woods to impress the internet character Slenderman, so that way he wouldn't kill their families and allow them to become his servants. She survived, and was found by a cyclist.\nWeier was sentenced to up to 25 years in a mental hospital, and Geyser was sentenced to up to 40.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["civilian attack"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Waukesha%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Waukesha","offset":20},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":30},{"uri":"Slenderman","surface_form":"Slenderman","offset":192},{"uri":"Mental_hospital","surface_form":"mental hospital","offset":372}]}
