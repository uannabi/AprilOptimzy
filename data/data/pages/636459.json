{"id":636459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattazhy","text":"Pattazhy, also Pattazhi is a village in Pathanapuram taluk, Kollam district, Kerala, India.\nEtymology.\nThe name Pattazhy has an uncertain etymology. Pattazhy may stem from an imperfect Malayalam portmanteau fusing Patt (\"Soft\") and Aazhy (\"Ocean\"). Thus the word Pattazhy represents the compassion and affection of Pattazhy Devi to her beloved devotees and depth of her grace. The name Pattazhy may have also derived from the word \"Bhattarika\" which means a virtuous and pious woman.\nCulture.\nThe annual festival at Pattazhy Devi Temple is one of the famous temple festivals in central Travancore.The Kumbhathiruvathira and Meenathiruvathira were the famous festivals of Pattazhy. The festival is known for Kambam (fire works), Aalpindi Vilakku Ezhunnallathu (Procession of small structure made out of plantain kernel and germinating leaves of coconut tree with numerous lamps on it), Ponnin Thirumudi (Devi's idol carved out of pure gold and rare precious stones) Ezhunnallathu. Pattazhy also got a place in the Guinness Book of world records for the 'Longest bamboo'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Taluk","surface_form":"taluk","offset":53},{"uri":"Kollam_district","surface_form":"Kollam district","offset":60},{"uri":"Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala","offset":77},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":85},{"uri":"Malayalam","surface_form":"Malayalam","offset":185},{"uri":"Portmanteau","surface_form":"portmanteau","offset":195},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"Ocean","offset":240},{"uri":"Devi","surface_form":"Devi","offset":324},{"uri":"Virtuous","surface_form":"virtuous","offset":458},{"uri":"Pious","surface_form":"pious","offset":471},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":504},{"uri":"Travancore","surface_form":"Travancore","offset":586},{"uri":"Festival","surface_form":"festival","offset":685},{"uri":"Fire_works","surface_form":"fire works","offset":715},{"uri":"Plantain_(cooking)","surface_form":"plantain","offset":802},{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut","offset":844},{"uri":"Devi","surface_form":"Devi","offset":903},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":934},{"uri":"Guinness_Book","surface_form":"Guinness Book","offset":1013}]}
