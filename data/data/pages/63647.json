{"id":63647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe","text":"Miss Universe is an international beauty contest. It was started in 1952 and today has over 190 countries taking part. About one billion people watch it on television every year.\nThe pageant is owned by WME and IMG, with Fox owning the rights to broadcast the pageant on television. Until 2015, it was owned by NBC and Donald Trump. In 2015, Trump started his campaign for President of the United States and said he wanted to stop illegal immigrants from Mexico from coming into the US. NBC then stopped working with him, and so Trump bought Miss Universe out, and sold it to its current owners a few days later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beauty_contest","surface_form":"beauty contest","offset":34},{"uri":"William_Morris_Endeavor","surface_form":"WME","offset":203},{"uri":"IMG_(company)","surface_form":"IMG","offset":211},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox","offset":221},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":311},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":319},{"uri":"Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign%2C_2016","surface_form":"campaign","offset":360},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":373},{"uri":"Illegal_immigrant","surface_form":"illegal immigrant","offset":431},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":455},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"US","offset":483}]}
