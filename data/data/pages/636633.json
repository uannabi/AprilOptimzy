{"id":636633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopa%C4%8Da_(Vrbanja)","text":"Lopa\u010Da is one of many right tributaries in the upper flow of Vrbanja (Bosnia and Herzegovina). Lopa\u010Da has its source from two components (small streams) in the eastern slopes of Sela\u010Dka Mountain, between the hills Marina Glava (1192 m) and Lujin Dirjek (1180 m). These components of the source meet at about 1090 m.\nIn the upper part of its course, Lopa\u010Da flows towards the southwest, then it goes to the northwest, then just before its confluence to Vrbanja, redirects again to the southwest.\nLopa\u010Da flows below the village of Geli\u0107i, along the slopes of Melina (north) and Osoje (south). It flows into Vrbanja at an altitude of 566 m, under the slopes of Previja with the summit of Padali\u0161\u0107e (785 m).\nOn each side, it receives water from six streams and small streams, the largest of which (right) is Dolovi. It also receives water from several coastal sources, which keeps its water level relatively stable even during the longest periods of drought.\nBelow the village of Geli\u0107i until its confluence, in the 1960s, there were 20 watermills on Lopa\u010Da.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja","offset":61},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":70},{"uri":"Watermill","surface_form":"watermill","offset":1032}]}
