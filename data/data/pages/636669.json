{"id":636669,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_color","text":"False color (or false colour) refers to a group of color methods used to display recorded images in color. A false-color image is an image which shows an object in colors different from that which a true-colour photograph would show.\nIn addition, there is \"false color\" used for visualization of genuine data.\nA photograph shot in color will show the colors in the picture as they appeared on the film, or to the sensor of a digital camera. This is known as true-color image. In a false color image, the color shown in the image does not correspond to the one the film or sensor recorded. In such an image, which is known as false color image, color is used for extra information.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":51},{"uri":"Signal_processing","surface_form":"methods","offset":57},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":164},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":211},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":312},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":331},{"uri":"Photographic_film","surface_form":"film","offset":397},{"uri":"Sensor","surface_form":"sensor","offset":413},{"uri":"Digital_camera","surface_form":"digital camera","offset":425}]}
