{"id":636687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._C._George_Sudarshan","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ennackal Chandy George Sudarshan (also known as E. C. G. Sudarshan; 16 September 1931 \u2013 14 May 2018) was an Indian theoretical physicist. He was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\nSudarshan was known for his works to the field of theoretical Physics including Optical coherence, Sudarshan-Glauber representation, V-A theory, Tachyons, Quantum Zeno effect, Open quantum system, Spin-statistics theorem, non-invariance groups, positive maps of density matrices, quantum computation among others.\nHis works include also relations between east and west, philosophy and religion.\nIn 2005, the Nobel Committee controversially did not award Sudarshan the Nobel Prize in Physics yet awarded his work about Glauber\u2013Sudarshan P representation to Roy J. Glauber only.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":140},{"uri":"University_of_Texas_at_Austin","surface_form":"University of Texas at Austin","offset":177},{"uri":"Coherence_(physics)","surface_form":"Optical coherence","offset":288},{"uri":"Sudarshan-Glauber_representation","surface_form":"Sudarshan-Glauber representation","offset":307},{"uri":"V-A_theory","surface_form":"V-A theory","offset":341},{"uri":"Tachyon","surface_form":"Tachyon","offset":353},{"uri":"Quantum_Zeno_effect","surface_form":"Quantum Zeno effect","offset":363},{"uri":"Open_quantum_system","surface_form":"Open quantum system","offset":384},{"uri":"Spin-statistics_theorem","surface_form":"Spin-statistics theorem","offset":405},{"uri":"Nobel_Committee","surface_form":"Nobel Committee","offset":616},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":676},{"uri":"Glauber%E2%80%93Sudarshan_P_representation","surface_form":"Glauber\u2013Sudarshan P representation","offset":726},{"uri":"Roy_J._Glauber","surface_form":"Roy J.
