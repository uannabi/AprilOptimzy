{"id":636712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Philippines","text":"The President of the Philippines (, informally known as \"Presidente ng Pilipinas\") is the head of state and head of government of the Philippines.\nThe President leads the executive branch of the Philippine government and is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The President is directly elected by the people, and is one of only two nationally elected executive officials, the other being the Vice President of the Philippines.\nHowever, four vice presidents have assumed the presidency without having been elected to the office, such as by the death or resignation of an incumbent president.\nFilipinos refer to their President as \"Pangulo\" or \"Presidente\". The President serves a single, fixed, six-year term without possibility of re-election. On June 30, 2016, Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as the 16th and current president.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":90},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":108},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":134},{"uri":"Commander-in-chief","surface_form":"commander-in-chief","offset":228},{"uri":"Armed_Forces_of_the_Philippines","surface_form":"Armed Forces of the Philippines","offset":254},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_Philippines","surface_form":"Vice President of the Philippines","offset":419},{"uri":"Incumbent","surface_form":"incumbent","offset":597},{"uri":"Rodrigo_Duterte","surface_form":"Rodrigo Duterte","offset":789},{"uri":"Inauguration_of_Rodrigo_Duterte","surface_form":"sworn in","offset":809}]}
