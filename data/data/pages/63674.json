It first flew in 1978 and was introduced in 1983. Its main user is the United States Navy. It can take off from aircraft carriers because of its special design. The F/A-18 can attack land and air targets. Any aircraft which can do this is called \"multi-role\". The Hornet is also flown by the Blue Angels.\nUsers.\nThe F/A-18 is used by many countries, including the United States Navy\nUnited States.\nThe United States navy is the biggest user of the hornet. The hornet is currently only used by the United States Marine Corps, but until 2019 the U.S. Navy also had them.\nThe USMC currently has 143 F/A-18 hornets.\nBlue Angels.\nThe Blue Angels are the aerobatic team of the USMC. They use the F/A-18. Before the F/A-18 existed, they used the A-4 Skyhawk.\nAustralia.\nThe Royal Australian Air force (RAAF) bought 57 F/A-18A and 18 F/A-18B (the b was used for training) in 1981 to replace the old Mirage III. The difference between the RAAF hornet and the US hornet is that the RAAF removed the carrier Capabilities, because Australia doesn't have any aircraft carriers big enough to fit the plane.\nArmament.\nThe hornet can carry a lot of bombs, missiles, rockets and guns. It can also carry pods, pods give the aircraft more options, the Litening targeting pod,for example, lets the pilot see the ground and guide bombs to the target.\nBombs.\nB81 and B83 nuclear bombs\nJoint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM)\nPaveway laser guided bombs (the bombs are guided by the targeting pod)\nRockets.\n2.75 in (70 mm) Hydra 70 rockets\n5 in (127.0 mm) Zuni rockets\nAir to Air.\nAim-120 AMRAAM\nAim-9 Sidewinder\nAim-132 ASRAAM\nAim-7 Sparrow\nAir to Ground.\nAGM-65 Maverick\nAGM-88 HARM\nAGM-164 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW)\nTaurus Cruise Missile\nAnti Ship.\nAGM-84 Harpoon\nSimulacrum of Multirole fighter.\nMiG-35 - Simulacrum of the A-18 Hornet","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter_jet","surface_form":"fighter jet","offset":51},{"uri":"Boeing","surface_form":"Boeing","offset":79},{"uri":"McDonnell-Douglas","surface_form":"McDonnell-Douglas","offset":126},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":224},{"uri":"Aircraft_carrier","surface_form":"aircraft carrier","offset":265},{"uri":"Blue_Angels","surface_form":"Blue Angels","offset":445},{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"United States Marine Corps,","offset":650},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"U.S. Navy","offset":697},{"uri":"United_States_Marine_Corps","surface_form":"USMC","offset":726},{"uri":"Blue_Angels","surface_form":"Blue Angels","offset":782},{"uri":"A-4_Skyhawk","surface_form":"A-4 Skyhawk","offset":892},{"uri":"Dassault_Mirage_III","surface_form":"Mirage III","offset":1044},{"uri":"Litening_targeting_pod","surface_form":"Litening","offset":1386},{"uri":"B81","surface_form":"B81","offset":1490},{"uri":"B83","surface_form":"B83","offset":1498},{"uri":"Nuclear_bomb","surface_form":"nuclear bombs","offset":1502},{"uri":"Joint_Direct_Attack_Munition","surface_form":"Joint Direct Attack Munition","offset":1516},{"uri":"Paveway_laser_guided_bombs","surface_form":"Paveway laser guided bombs","offset":1552},{"uri":"Hydra_70_rockets","surface_form":"Hydra 70 rockets","offset":1648},{"uri":"Zuni_rockets","surface_form":"Zuni rockets","offset":1681},{"uri":"Aim120_AMRAAM","surface_form":"Aim-120 AMRAAM","offset":1706},{"uri":"AIM-9_Sidewinder","surface_form":"Aim-9 Sidewinder","offset":1721},{"uri":"Aim-132_ASRAAM","surface_form":"Aim-132 ASRAAM","offset":1738},{"uri":"Aim-7_Sparrow","surface_form":"Aim-7 Sparrow","offset":1753},{"uri":"AGM-65_Maverick","surface_form":"AGM-65 Maverick","offset":1782},{"uri":"Agm-88_HARM","surface_form":"AGM-88 HARM","offset":1798},{"uri":"AGM164","surface_form":"AGM-164 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW)","offset":1810},{"uri":"Taurus_(missile)","surface_form":"Taurus","offset":1847},{"uri":"Cruise_Missile","surface_form":"Cruise Missile","offset":1854},{"uri":"AGM-84_Harpoon","surface_form":"AGM-84 Harpoon","offset":1880},{"uri":"Mikoyan_MiG-35","surface_form":"MiG-35","offset":1928},{"uri":"McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet","surface_form":"A-18 Hornet","offset":1955}]}
