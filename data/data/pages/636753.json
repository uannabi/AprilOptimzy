{"id":636753,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst","text":"=\"preserve\">A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct membrane and division compared with the nearby tissue.\nIt is a cluster of cells that has grouped together to form a sac however an aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the \"shell\" of such a sac are distinctly abnormal when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location.\nIt may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess, not a cyst. Once formed, sometimes a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically, but that would depend upon its type and location.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Membrane","surface_form":"membrane","offset":54},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"division","offset":67},{"uri":"Biological_tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":101},{"uri":"Pus","surface_form":"pus","offset":412},{"uri":"Abscess","surface_form":"abscess","offset":429}]}
