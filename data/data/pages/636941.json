{"id":636941,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee","text":"The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC, or House Committee on Un-American Activities, or HCUA) was an investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives.\nThe HUAC was created in 1938 to investigate alleged activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having communist ties. In 1969, the House changed the committee's name to \"House Committee on Internal Security\". When the House abolished the committee in 1975, its functions were transferred to the House Judiciary Committee.\nThe committee's anti-communist investigations are often associated with those of Joseph McCarthy who, as a U.S. Senator, had no direct involvement with this House committee. McCarthy was the chairman of the Government Operations Committee and its Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate, not the House.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Congressional_committee","surface_form":"committee","offset":126},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":143},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":341},{"uri":"United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary","surface_form":"House Judiciary Committee","offset":534},{"uri":"Joseph_McCarthy","surface_form":"Joseph McCarthy","offset":642},{"uri":"United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs","surface_form":"Government Operations Committee","offset":768},{"uri":"United_States_Senate_Homeland_Security_Permanent_Subcommittee_on_Investigations","surface_form":"Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations","offset":808}]}
