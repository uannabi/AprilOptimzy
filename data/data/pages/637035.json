{"id":637035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_and_language_integrated_learning","text":"=\"preserve\">Content and Language Integrated Learning, or CLIL, is an approach to foreign or second language education. Students learn both the foreign language and school subjects together at the same time.\nMany people describe CLIL as having \"Four C's.\" Usually they are: cognition, content, communication, and culture. Some people think \"community\" should replace culture.\nCLIL comes from earlier approaches to language education such as bilingual education in Canada and Content-based Instruction in ESL and EFL around the world. CLIL has become very popular in primary and secondary education in Europe, especially Spain. But, it is becoming popular in many other countries, too.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cognition","surface_form":"cognition","offset":273},{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":293},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":312},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":340},{"uri":"Bilingual_education","surface_form":"bilingual education","offset":440},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":463},{"uri":"Content-based_Instruction","surface_form":"Content-based Instruction","offset":474},{"uri":"ESL","surface_form":"ESL","offset":503},{"uri":"EFL","surface_form":"EFL","offset":511}]}
