{"id":637067,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhoa","text":"Viet comics () is a term that was created by \"Floral Age Bimonthly\" in about the 1960s. Sometimes, it was called manhoa (,) by those who disliked it for imitating Eastern Asian comics.\nPre-1900.\nDuring the Medieval Annam, \"Viet comics\" often be called \"m\u1EA1n h\u1ECDa\" (\u6F2B\u756B, comics) or \"li\u00EAn-ho\u00E0n h\u1ECDa\" (\u9023\u74B0\u756B, sequential drawings) which was affected by China and sometimes India. They illustrated philosophy or tales which were printed by wood-blocks. There were some drawings for the educating females which were called \"moral books\" (Lu\u00E2n-l\u00FD gi\u00E1o-khoa th\u01B0).\nFrench Indochina (1900 - 1953).\nAfter the establishing of the F\u00E9d\u00E9ration indochinoise with a long peace, the printing technology developed strongly to make books and newspapers became more. \"Viet comics\" has appeared gradually as cartoons which was called \"ho\u1EA1t-k\u00EA h\u1ECDa\" (\u6ED1\u7A3D\u756B), \"h\u00ED h\u1ECDa\" (\u6232\u756B) or \"bi\u1EBFm h\u1ECDa\" (\u8CB6\u756B).\nAbout 1930s when Europeanisation movement was, \"Viet comics\" becamed an independent art with a big number of artists and readers. Customs&Mores Weekly (Phong-H\u00F3a tu\u1EA7n-b\u00E1o) and Today Weekly (Ng\u00E0y-Nay tu\u1EA7n-b\u00E1o) had known with three comic characters Bang B\u1EA1nh - X\u00E3 X\u1EC7 - L\u00FD To\u00E9t, Official's Son Weekly (C\u1EADu-\u1EA4m tu\u1EA7n-b\u00E1o) with the \"Three adventurous kids\" (Ba \u0111\u1EE9a tr\u1EBB m\u1EA1o-hi\u1EC3m), Drake Weekly (V\u1ECBt-\u0110\u1EF1c tu\u1EA7n-b\u00E1o) with sequential drawings what often satirized Annamese writers, Indochinese government, especially the Governors-General... \"Viet comics\" always be called \"chuy\u1EC7n b\u1EB1ng tranh\" (stories by drawings).\nAfter WWII, there were comics what asked Vietnamese people against French Army and satirized French Government. In Hanoi and Saigon there were more comics what based on romance novels or knight tales. Besides, there were some comics with the topic of Vietnamese history and mythology.\nNorthern and Southern Vietnam (1954 - 1975).\nFrom the late 1960s, comics flourished in the Republic of Vietnam by the Freedom of the Press. Firstly, the Floral Age Bimonthly (established in 1962) called \"Viet comics\" as \"Tranh-truy\u1EC7n Vi\u1EC7t-nam\" (Vietnamese pictorial-stories).\nThese led to an increase in the number of comic artists. The most famous illustrator and comic artist at the time was V\u00F5 H\u00F9ng Ki\u1EC7t and he was also an illustrator for stamps. His comics were much loved by children and even women. Topics often as: Family, friendship, adventure, detective, science fiction, wuxia, fairytales... which was affected by French comics, American and Hollywood, even Jules Verne, Conan Doyle, Jin Yong's works.\nIn the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, comics usually appeared on Pioneer Magazine, Children Magazine and Kim-\u0110\u1ED3ng books. Their contents were about family, friendship, moral, war, fairytales... Northern artists' style always be affected by Soviet art.\nEra of Subsidy (1976 - 1985).\nAfter the Reunification Day, Viet comics' style was more and more un-diversity because the print has been difficult. However, in 1980s there were some Kim-\u0110\u1ED3ng's artists who started drawed in d\u00F3 paper because they were very cheap. Topics often be fairytales and war for avoiding the censorship.\nEra of Reform (1986 - 2006).\nViet comics have changed much since 1987 as they steadily developed though the years and gradually became similar to American comics with a growing number of comic artists and comic genres. Meanwhile, in response to the needs of children, the government attached special importance in encouraging the creation of comics. The most famous artist was Nguy\u1EC5n H\u00F9ng L\u00E2n whose comics were popularly read (\"Hero Hesman\", \"Vietnamese supermen\", \"Vietnamese fairytales\"...). The content of these publications was broadly educational and offered lessons in moral philosophy for the reader. Many artists often \"borrowed\" international comics and animated films for imitating, as: \"Well just you wait\", \"Superman\", \"Jurassic park\", \"Tom and Jerry\", \"Charlot\"...\nEverything was to change in 1992 with the import of manga by Kim-\u0110\u1ED3ng and Youth. Since 1995 when the manga storm would really hit, suddenly Viet comics with educational and moral stories were overwhelmed and dull by comparison. Manga was able to engage with a broad readership and was readily available; it saturated the market even though most was then illegally printed. That changed in 2004 when Vietnam finally signed an expanded version of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and copyright was discussed and respected. The management of sales and content of manga has since become strictly controlled.\nEra of Recession (2007 to now).\nDespite the \"invasion\" (called by 2000s Vietnames newspapers) of manga-manhwa-manhua fighting for a place in the Vietnamese market, 4 the rise of comics in a Vietnamese style was slow to gain pace given lingering prejudices, the feeling that comics were for children. Yet gradually, Vietnamese artists started to produce comics. In 2002, the Phan Th\u1ECB Company published the comic series titled \"Vietnamese child prodigies\" (Th\u1EA7n-\u0111\u1ED3ng \u0111\u1EA5t Vi\u1EC7t) and this was a turning point in Viet comics. It attracted many young readers and became a long-selling comic with more than 120 volumes produced. The comic might be considered similar to manga in panel layout and onomatopoeia (the formation of a word from a sound associated with what is named), and the style in which characters are drawn.\nMoreover, Youth Laughs Monthly, Hoa H\u1ECDc Tr\u00F2 Weekly and Truy\u1EC7n Tranh Tr\u1EBB Magazine (Youth Publishing House) also worked positively. They called Viet comics as \"m\u1EA1n h\u1ECDa\" for dream about the comics compared \"triman\" (manga-manhwa-manhua).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Term","surface_form":"term","offset":20},{"uri":"Eastern_Asia","surface_form":"Eastern
