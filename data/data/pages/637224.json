{"id":637224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta","text":"e=\"preserve\">Brahmagupta () (born, died) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. He was the author of two early works on mathematics and astronomy: the \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1E6Dasiddh\u0101nta\" (BSS, \"correctly established doctrine of Brahma\", dated 628).\nBrahmagupta was the first to give rules to compute with \"zero\". The texts composed by Brahmagupta were composed in elliptical verse in Sanskrit, as was common practice in Indian mathematics. As no proofs are given, it is not known how Brahmagupta's results were derived.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":55},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":73},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":125},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":141},{"uri":"Br%C4%81hmasphu%E1%B9%ADasiddh%C4%81nta","surface_form":"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1E6Dasiddh\u0101nta","offset":157},{"uri":"Siddhanta","surface_form":"doctrine","offset":209},{"uri":"Brahma","surface_form":"Brahma","offset":221},{"uri":"Zero","surface_form":"zero","offset":299},{"uri":"Elliptical_poetry","surface_form":"elliptical verse","offset":357},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":377},{"uri":"Indian_mathematics","surface_form":"Indian mathematics","offset":413}]}
