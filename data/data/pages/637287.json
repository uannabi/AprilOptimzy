{"id":637287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery","text":"An orrery is a mechanical model of the Solar System. It shows the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons. It is usually a heliocentric model.\nThe Greeks had working planetaria. The first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704. One was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery \u2013 hence the name. They are usually driven by a clockwork mechanism. The globe in the centre represents the Sun, and a planet is at the end of each arm.\nThe first known orrery was the Antikythera mechanism, variously dated from 60 to 150 BC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Model","surface_form":"model","offset":26},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":39},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":104},{"uri":"Natural_satellite","surface_form":"moon","offset":116},{"uri":"Heliocentric","surface_form":"heliocentric","offset":139},{"uri":"Planetaria","surface_form":"planetaria","offset":182},{"uri":"Charles_Boyle%2C_4th_Earl_of_Orrery","surface_form":"Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery","offset":295},{"uri":"Clockwork","surface_form":"clockwork","offset":376},{"uri":"Antikythera_mechanism","surface_form":"Antikythera mechanism","offset":512},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":566}]}
