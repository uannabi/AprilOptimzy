{"id":637289,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork","text":"e=\"preserve\">Clockwork means the inner workings of mechanical machines clocks (where it is also called a \"movement\". Also other similar mechanisms with a complex series of gears.\nA clockwork mechanism usually has a clockwork motor. This has a mainspring, a spiral of metal ribbon. Energy is stored in the mainspring by \"winding it up\", turning a key attached to a ratchet which twists the mainspring tighter. Then the force of the mainspring turns the clockwork gears, until the stored energy is used up. The adjectives \"wind-up\" and \"spring-powered\" refer to mainspring-powered clockwork devices. These include clocks and watches, kitchen timers, music boxes, and wind-up toys.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clock","surface_form":"clock","offset":71},{"uri":"Gear","surface_form":"gear","offset":172},{"uri":"Mainspring","surface_form":"mainspring","offset":243},{"uri":"Ratchet","surface_form":"ratchet","offset":364},{"uri":"Watches","surface_form":"watches","offset":623},{"uri":"Timer","surface_form":"timer","offset":640},{"uri":"Music_box","surface_form":"music box","offset":648},{"uri":"Wind-up_toy","surface_form":"wind-up toy","offset":665}]}
