It can move any number of unoccupied squares diagonally, vertically, and horizontally. When recording games it is shortened to Q.\nThe queen's movement.\nThe queen moves like a bishop and rook both. Although both players start with one queen each. A player may promote a pawn to a piece, usually a queen, when the pawn reaches the last line of the opponent team.\nHistory of the queen in chess.\nThe IndoArabic game lasted for nearly a thousand years until the end of the 15th century. In it, the piece next to the Shah was the Firz\u0101n or Visier, who was a counsellor. This piece had a movement even more limited than the king: it moved just one square at a time, on the diagonal. Not surprising, then, that when the move changed into its modern form, the Italians called the new game \"schacci alla rabioso\" (~furious chess).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":13},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":53},{"uri":"Diagonal","surface_form":"diagonal","offset":129},{"uri":"Vertical","surface_form":"vertical","offset":141},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":157},{"uri":"Bishop_(chess)","surface_form":"bishop","offset":259},{"uri":"Rook_(chess)","surface_form":"rook","offset":270},{"uri":"History_of_chess","surface_form":"IndoArabic game","offset":480}]}
