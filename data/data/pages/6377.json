{"id":6377,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moctezuma_II","text":"Moctezuma II, also known as Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin (1466-1520) and often called Montezuma in English, was the Aztec emperor (\"tlahtoani\") from 1502 to 1520. His name comes from the Nahuatl \"Motecuhzoma\", it means \"he who is leader because of his fury\". In Spanish, he is called Moctezuma.\nWhen Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s arrived in Mexico in 1519, Moctezuma thought he was the god Quetzalcoatl, and did not want to fight against him. Cort\u00E9s took Moctezuma prisoner. When the Aztecs wanted Cort\u00E9s to get out of their capital Tenochtitlan in 1520, Cortes told Moctezuma to calm down his people. When doing that he died. The Spaniards said he was killed by the Aztecs, while the Aztecs said Cort\u00E9s killed him. The Spanish said that the Aztec people threw rocks at him, killing him. The Aztecs said that they found his body in the streets with a lot of cuts made with a sword after the Spanish left.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1466","surface_form":"1466","offset":52},{"uri":"1520","surface_form":"1520","offset":57},{"uri":"Aztecs","surface_form":"Aztec","offset":110},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":116},{"uri":"1502","surface_form":"1502","offset":143},{"uri":"1520","surface_form":"1520","offset":151},{"uri":"Nahuatl","surface_form":"Nahuatl","offset":181},{"uri":"Leader","surface_form":"leader","offset":224},{"uri":"Rage_(emotion)","surface_form":"fury","offset":246},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":256},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":294},{"uri":"1519","surface_form":"1519","offset":329},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"god","offset":364},{"uri":"Quetzalcoatl","surface_form":"Quetzalcoatl","offset":368},{"uri":"Prisoner","surface_form":"prisoner","offset":443},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":503},{"uri":"Tenochtitlan","surface_form":"Tenochtitlan","offset":511}]}
