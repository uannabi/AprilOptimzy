{"id":637735,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyan_Petrov","text":"Boyan Petrov (, 7 February 1973 \u2013) was a Bulgarian zoologist and mountaineer. He worked at the National Museum of Natural History in Sofia.\nHe had climbed 10 out of 14 eight-thousanders, all without supplementary oxygen. This made him the Bulgarian altitude climber with the highest number of successful ascents of peaks over 8000 meters. He was the first Bulgarian to climb four of those mountains - Gasherbrum I (2009), Kangchenjunga (2014), K2 (2014) and Manaslu (2015).\nPetrov was declared missing on Shishapangma on 5 May 2018. The search for him was discontinued on 16 May. According to climbers, he may have fallen into a crevasse on the way to the top.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":41},{"uri":"Zoologist","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":51},{"uri":"Mountaineer","surface_form":"mountaineer","offset":65},{"uri":"National_Museum_of_Natural_History_(Bulgaria)","surface_form":"National Museum of Natural History","offset":95},{"uri":"Sofia","surface_form":"Sofia","offset":133},{"uri":"Eight-thousander","surface_form":"eight-thousander","offset":168},{"uri":"Gasherbrum_I","surface_form":"Gasherbrum I","offset":401},{"uri":"Kangchenjunga","surface_form":"Kangchenjunga","offset":422},{"uri":"K2","surface_form":"K2","offset":444},{"uri":"Manaslu","surface_form":"Manaslu","offset":458},{"uri":"Shishapangma","surface_form":"Shishapangma","offset":505}]}
