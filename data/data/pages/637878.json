{"id":637878,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod","text":"=\"preserve\">Garry's Mod is a modification for the game \"Half-Life 2\" originally released in 2004.\nIn the game, there are no rules or objectives, allowing players to do whatever they want, like building contraptions such as cars, aircraft and more. The game uses things from \"Half-Life 2\", such as the HUD and props, but you can add more things by installing mods or adding other games that use the Source game engine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Half-Life_2","surface_form":"Half-Life 2","offset":56},{"uri":"Source_engine","surface_form":"Source game engine","offset":398}]}
