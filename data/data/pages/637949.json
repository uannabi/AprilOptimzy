He competed in National Hunt races.\nAfter winning only one of his five races in his native country, Sir Des Champs was transferred to Ireland and won seven races in succession including the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle, Greenmount Park Novice Chase, Killiney Novice Chase, Jewson Novices' Chase and Growise Champion Novice Chase. The 2012/2013 saw the emergence of a rivalry between Sir Des Champs and another Irish-trained chaser Flemenstar.\nAfter beating his rival in the Hennessy Gold Cup, Sir Des Champs was regarded as a leading contender for the 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup in which he finished second to Bobs Worth.\nHe suffered a fatal injury when competing in Point-to-point racing on 18 May 2018 at the age of 11.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"AQPS","surface_form":"AQPS","offset":83},{"uri":"Horse_racing","surface_form":"racehorse","offset":88},{"uri":"National_Hunt","surface_form":"National Hunt","offset":114},{"uri":"Martin_Pipe_Conditional_Jockeys%27_Handicap_Hurdle","surface_form":"Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle","offset":289},{"uri":"Greenmount_Park_Novice_Chase","surface_form":"Greenmount Park Novice Chase","offset":339},{"uri":"Killiney_Novice_Chase","surface_form":"Killiney Novice Chase","offset":369},{"uri":"Jewson_Novices%27_Chase","surface_form":"Jewson Novices' Chase","offset":392},{"uri":"Growise_Champion_Novice_Chase","surface_form":"Growise Champion Novice Chase","offset":418},{"uri":"Flemenstar","surface_form":"Flemenstar","offset":550},{"uri":"Hennessy_Gold_Cup_(Ireland)","surface_form":"Hennessy Gold Cup","offset":593},{"uri":"Cheltenham_Gold_Cup","surface_form":"Cheltenham Gold Cup","offset":676},{"uri":"Bobs_Worth","surface_form":"Bobs Worth","offset":727},{"uri":"Point-to-point_(steeplechase)","surface_form":"Point-to-point","offset":784}]}
