Several relatives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad had the name, including his daughter Fatimah\nThe colloquial Arabic pronunciation of the name in some dialects (e.g., Syria and Egyptian) often omits the unstressed second syllable and renders it as \"Fatma\" when romanized.\nFatima is also used by non-Muslims: the town of F\u00E1tima, Portugal was named after a Moorish princess. It was the site of a famous Marian apparition in 1917, after which it achieved some popularity as a female personal name among Roman Catholic populations, particularly in the Portuguese-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":8},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":154},{"uri":"Fatimah","surface_form":"Fatimah","offset":200},{"uri":"Arabic","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":223},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":280},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":441},{"uri":"1917","surface_form":"1917","offset":535}]}
