He was the father of Ceres, Jupiter, Veritas and others. He was associated with wealth, liberation, and time. He was identified with the Greek titan Kronos, whose reign (often referred to as the Golden Age) was regarded as a time of abundance and peace.\nThe\u00A0Temple of Saturn situated within the\u00A0Roman Forum housed the state treasury. In December, the festival of Saturnalia, perhaps the most famous of all the\u00A0Roman festivals, was held in his honor \u2014 it largely consisted of a public banquet, role reversals, private gift-giving and revelry. The planet Saturn is named after him and the modern English weekday Saturday (Latin \"di\u0113s S\u0101turni\" - \"Day of Saturn\") bears his name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman god","offset":33},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":46},{"uri":"Harvest","surface_form":"harvest","offset":62},{"uri":"Ceres","surface_form":"Ceres","offset":92},{"uri":"Jupiter_(god)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":99},{"uri":"Veritas","surface_form":"Veritas","offset":108},{"uri":"Titan_(mythology)","surface_form":"Greek titan","offset":208},{"uri":"Kronos","surface_form":"Kronos","offset":220},{"uri":"Golden_Age","surface_form":"Golden Age","offset":266},{"uri":"Temple_of_Saturn","surface_form":"Temple of Saturn","offset":329},{"uri":"Roman_Forum","surface_form":"Roman Forum","offset":366},{"uri":"Saturnalia","surface_form":"Saturnalia","offset":434},{"uri":"Saturn%C2%A0(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":624},{"uri":"Saturday","surface_form":"Saturday","offset":681},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":691}]}
