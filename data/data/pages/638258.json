{"id":638258,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluorocarbon","text":"=\"preserve\">Hydroflurocarbons (HFC) are chemical compounds made of hydrogen, carbon and fluorine.\nThey are used in air conditioning and as refrigerants in place of the older chlorofluorocarbons. HFC contain a hydrogen atom which cause it to decompose quickly before reaching the stratosphere. HFC do not contain chlorine which is harmful for the ozone layer. HFC survive in the atmosphere between two and forty years. CFC can stay at the atmosphere for up to 150 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":40},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":67},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":77},{"uri":"Fluorine","surface_form":"fluorine","offset":88},{"uri":"Air_conditioning","surface_form":"air conditioning","offset":115},{"uri":"Refrigerant","surface_form":"refrigerant","offset":139},{"uri":"Chlorofluorocarbon","surface_form":"chlorofluorocarbon","offset":174},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":218},{"uri":"Stratosphere","surface_form":"stratosphere","offset":279},{"uri":"Ozone_layer","surface_form":"ozone layer","offset":346},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":378},{"uri":"Chlorofluorocarbon","surface_form":"CFC","offset":418}]}
