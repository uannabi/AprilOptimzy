In addition to Germany, the company is active in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland and Switzerland.\nHistory and Development.\nIn 1960 Hans Weber took over a two-man carpentry business in Rheinau-Linx, which specialized in the production of residential buildings in timber frame (timber framing). In 1961, the first three prefabricated houses were built. In the 1970s, the first factory buildings were built in Linx, the license was acquired and henceforth only own houses were built. In 1978 a second factory was built in Wenden-H\u00FCnsborn.\nIn 1985, WeberHaus opened the first builders center in the industry at the Rheinau-Linx headquarters, a hall with sample solutions and advice for future clients. In 1991, WeberHaus was the first house construction company to introduce low-energy construction as the standard. In 1993, the first WeerHaus branch in Switzerland was founded in Kindhausen. In October 2000, WeberHaus opened the World of Living at the Rheinau-Linx headquarters, Europe's first and so far only theme park for building Since 2006 WeberHaus offers Plus Energy Houses. In addition to company founder Hans Weber and his wife Christa Weber, his daughter Heidi Weber-M\u00FChleck is one of the managing partners. Commercial director is Stephan Jager and Peter Liehner is managing director sales / marketing.\nEcology.\nSince 1990, WeberHaus has been building only low-energy houses and in 1996 developed the first zero-heating house, where solar plants produce hot water and electricity. In 2000, the first passive house followed with direct heating and heat recovery and in 2006 the plus energy house, which gains more energy than it needs. Every WeberHaus today is equipped with an ecological building shell. The wood fiber insulation board protects the house from external influences such as cold, heat and noise.\nWorld of Living.\nIn October 2000 WeberHaus opened the \"World of Living\" at the headquarters in Rheinau-Linx (Baden-Wurttemberg), Europe's first and so far only adventure park in the areas of building and living. The park covers an area of 75,000 square meters and offers a 5,000 square meter showroom. The World of Living show park is a space dedicated to choice, inspiration and imagination for contemporary home designs. The park features the Universe of Time - a curated history of home design through the ages and a village of full-size show homes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linx_(Rheinau)","surface_form":"Rheinau-Linx","offset":136},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":150},{"uri":"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg","surface_form":"Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg","offset":467},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":507},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":609},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":643},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":651},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":663},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":676},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":689},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":705},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":717},{"uri":"Hans_Weber_(entrepreneur%2C_1936)","surface_form":"Hans Weber","offset":763},{"uri":"Timber_framing","surface_form":"timber framing","offset":908},{"uri":"Plus_Energy_House","surface_form":"Plus Energy Houses","offset":1692},{"uri":"Low-energy_house","surface_form":"low-energy houses","offset":1997},{"uri":"Passive_house","surface_form":"passive house","offset":2140},{"uri":"Plus_energy_house","surface_form":"plus energy house","offset":2217},{"uri":"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg","surface_form":"Baden-Wurttemberg","offset":2559}]}
