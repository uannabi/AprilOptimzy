{"id":638448,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_music","text":"Purple music () is a kind of music that has been very much at the center of Vietnamese public life from the time of its first strong emergence in the country in the late 1930s up to the present day. It is known as the origin of Vietnamese popular music. Harmonious, sentimental and melancholy, many romantic songs of purple music have become regarded as national treasures and are still performed widely.\nHistory.\nSongs of Purple Music carry with them an air of nostalgia, perhaps nostalgia for an era when Vietnam was still unified, the era preceding nearly 20 years of civil war. After 1954, the country was split into two very different regimes, the communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam or North Vietnam, and the Republic of Vietnam or South Vietnam. At that time, some purple music composers went South, while others remained in the North. Most of the Northerners either ceased composing or followed the dictates of the regime for writing songs to mobilize the masses and strengthen the revolution. Southerners continued to write romantic songs. Since the North's victory resulting in Vietnam's reunification in 1975, the country's culture has continued to be divided between resident and overseas communities. As nearly all music and literature of a romantic or sentimental basis was banned by the communist regime, many of Vietnam's creative minds left the country in 1975 for Western countries like the United States, Australia, and France. Although differences between these two communities continue until this time, purple music is one of the few popular song genres that can be heard on the stage of both Vietnam and among the overseas community.\nAlthough Vietnamese music this period has gone through many movements: Patriotic songs, scout songs, happy songs, folk songs... the longest lasting movement is still love song movement. That is the music movement with greatest composers like V\u0103n Cao, Ph\u1EA1m Duy, L\u00EA Th\u01B0\u01A1ng... and with ever-lasting love songs like. Amongst the best-known ones are \"I Come to See You One Rainy Afternoon\" (Em \u0111\u1EBFn th\u0103m anh m\u1ED9t chi\u1EC1u m\u01B0a) by T\u00F4 V\u0169; \"Send the Wind to Blow Away the Clouds\" (G\u1EEDi gi\u00F3 cho m\u00E2y ng\u00E0n bay), \"Seductive Autumn\" (Thu quy\u1EBFn r\u0169), \"Leaves Falling in the Afternoon\" (L\u00E1 \u0111\u1ED5 mu\u00F4n chi\u1EC1u), \"A Letter\" (L\u00E1 th\u01B0), \"Plum Pack and Pansy Petal\" (M\u1ED9t g\u00F3i nho kh\u00F4, m\u1ED9t c\u00E1nh p\u0103ng-x\u00EA) by \u0110o\u00E0n Chu\u1EA9n; \"Resonance\" (D\u01B0 \u00E2m) by Nguy\u1EC5n V\u0103n T\u00FD; \"The Girl Next Door\" (C\u00F4 l\u00E1ng gi\u1EC1ng) by Ho\u00E0ng Qu\u00FD; \"Drop of Autumn Rain\" (Gi\u1ECDt m\u01B0a thu) and \"The Boat isn't Docking\" (Con thuy\u1EC1n kh\u00F4ng b\u1EBFn) by \u0110\u1EB7ng Th\u1EBF Phong.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":29},{"uri":"Vietnamese","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":76},{"uri":"Vietnamese","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":228},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":247},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":507},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":653},{"uri":"Socialist_Republic_of_Vietnam","surface_form":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam","offset":663},{"uri":"North_Vietnam","surface_form":"North Vietnam","offset":696},{"uri":"Republic_of_Vietnam","surface_form":"Republic of Vietnam","offset":719},{"uri":"South_Vietnam","surface_form":"South Vietnam","offset":742},{"uri":"South_Vietnam","surface_form":"South","offset":804},{"uri":"North_Vietnam","surface_form":"North","offset":840},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":994},{"uri":"North_Vietnam","surface_form":"North","offset":1063},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":1092},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1139},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":1232},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":1242},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"communist","offset":1306},{"uri":"Western","surface_form":"Western","offset":1386},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1413},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1428},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1443},{"uri":"Vietnamese","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":1669},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":1680},{"uri":"Scout","surface_form":"scout","offset":1748},{"uri":"V%C4%83n_Cao","surface_form":"V\u0103n Cao","offset":1902},{"uri":"Ph%E1%BA%A1m_Duy","surface_form":"Ph\u1EA1m Duy","offset":1911},{"uri":"L%C3%AA_Th%C6%B0%C6%A1ng","surface_form":"L\u00EA Th\u01B0\u01A1ng","offset":1921},{"uri":"T%C3%B4_V%C5%A9","surface_form":"T\u00F4 V\u0169","offset":2080},{"uri":"%C4%90o%C3%A0n_Chu%E1%BA%A9n","surface_form":"\u0110o\u00E0n Chu\u1EA9n","offset":2332},{"uri":"Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_T%C3%BD","surface_form":"Nguy\u1EC5n V\u0103n T\u00FD","offset":2367},{"uri":"Ho%C3%A0ng_Qu%C3%BD","surface_form":"Ho\u00E0ng Qu\u00FD","offset":2422},{"uri":"%C4%90%E1%BA%B7ng_Th%E1%BA%BF_Phong","surface_form":"\u0110\u1EB7ng Th\u1EBF Phong","offset":2525}]}
