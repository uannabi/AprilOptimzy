{"id":638461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampharos","text":"Ampharos is an Electric-type Pokemon that first appeared in the second generation games, Gold/Silver/Crystal. It evolves from Flaaffy at Level 30, which in-turn evolved from Mareep at Level 15. The Pokedex classifies it as the Lighthouse Pokemon, which has often been portrayed in various media: In Pokemon Gold, Silver and Crystal, an Ampharos lights-up the Olivine City lighthouse.\nFrom X/Y onwards, an Ampharos holding the \"Ampharosite\" item can mega evolve into Mega Ampharos, which is an Electric/Dragon type with extra points mostly going into its Special Attack stat. However it does lose 10 points of speed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pokemon","offset":29}]}
