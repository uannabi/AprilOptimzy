It may have been a premature \"Prosaurolophus\".\nHolotype.\nThe holotype specimen was likely washed out to sea by a river, where it eventually sank and was buried in the silty carbonate sediments of Alabama.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":37},{"uri":"Hadrosauridae","surface_form":"hadrosaurid","offset":46},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":58},{"uri":"Late_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Late Cretaceous","offset":76},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":135},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":151},{"uri":"Hadrosaurid","surface_form":"saurolophine","offset":232},{"uri":"Dallas_County%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Dallas County","offset":393},{"uri":"Selma%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Selma, Alabama","offset":428},{"uri":"Prosaurolophus","surface_form":"Prosaurolophus","offset":557},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":700}]}
