{"id":63856,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_%26_Faith","text":"\"Hope & Faith\" was an American television series. It was a sitcom that aired for three seasons on ABC from 2003 to 2006. For its first two seasons the series was part of a revived TGIF comedy block.\nThe series starred Faith Ford as Hope and Kelly Ripa as Faith. Ford plays a homemaker with a husband (played by Ted McGinley) and three children. Ripa plays her sister, a soap opera star whose character is killed off, leading her to move in with her sister's family. The series is based in part on the life of its creator, Joanna Johnson, a former cast member of \"The Bold and the Beautiful\". The series featured guest stars such as Tony Curtis, Dean Cain, Robert Wagner, Regis Philbin (Ripa's co-host on \"Live with Regis and Kelly\"), Kathie Lee Gifford, and Mark Consuelos (Ripa's husband).\nThe series was primarily filmed at New York City's Silvercup East, a sister studio to Silvercup Studios, to accommodate Ripa's schedule with \"Live with Regis and Kelly\".\nAll 73 episodes were picked up by the American television network, as the total number of produced episodes was short of what was required for American television syndication.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":22},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":31},{"uri":"Situation_comedy","surface_form":"sitcom","offset":59},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":98},{"uri":"TGIF_(ABC)","surface_form":"TGIF","offset":180},{"uri":"Faith_Ford","surface_form":"Faith Ford","offset":218},{"uri":"Kelly_Ripa","surface_form":"Kelly Ripa","offset":241},{"uri":"Ted_McGinley","surface_form":"Ted McGinley","offset":311},{"uri":"Soap_opera","surface_form":"soap opera","offset":370},{"uri":"Joanna_Johnson","surface_form":"Joanna Johnson","offset":522},{"uri":"The_Bold_and_the_Beautiful","surface_form":"The Bold and the Beautiful","offset":563},{"uri":"Tony_Curtis","surface_form":"Tony Curtis","offset":632},{"uri":"Dean_Cain","surface_form":"Dean Cain","offset":645},{"uri":"Robert_Wagner","surface_form":"Robert Wagner","offset":656},{"uri":"Regis_Philbin","surface_form":"Regis Philbin","offset":671},{"uri":"Live_with_Regis_and_Kelly","surface_form":"Live with Regis and Kelly","offset":705},{"uri":"Kathie_Lee_Gifford","surface_form":"Kathie Lee Gifford","offset":734},{"uri":"Mark_Consuelos","surface_form":"Mark Consuelos","offset":758},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":826},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":968},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"television network","offset":1008},{"uri":"Television_syndication","surface_form":"television syndication","offset":1113}]}
