From the 13th century on, the region was more often called \"Donji kraji Slavonije\" than \"Donji kraji Bosne\" or \"Donji kraji Bosanski\".\nThe territory of Donji Kraji in the 13th century included the parishes: Uskoplje, Pliva, Luka, Vrbas, Zemljanik (Resnik), Vrbanja, Tribava (Trijebovo), Mel, Lu\u0161ci and Banjica. During the reign of Hrvoje, Donji Kraji merged with Sana, Gla\u017E, Vrbas (which has since been lost), and briefly Dubica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":173},{"uri":"Bosanska_Krajina","surface_form":"Bosanska Krajina","offset":225},{"uri":"Klju%C4%8D%2C_Una-Sana_Canton","surface_form":"Klju\u010D on the Sana","offset":315}]}
