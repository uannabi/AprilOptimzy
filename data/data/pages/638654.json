{"id":638654,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic","text":"Antipyretics (, from the words \"anti-\" meaning 'against' and ' meaning 'feverish') are substances that reduce fever. Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to ignore increases in temperature caused by prostaglandin. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever.\nMost antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the United States are ibuprofen and aspirin. These are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used mainly as analgesics to relieve pain, but which also have antipyretic properties. Acetaminophen or (paracetamol), is an analgesic with weak anti-inflammatory properties.\nThere is some debate over using medication to control fever. Fever is part of the body's immune response to infection. A study by the Royal Society found controlling fever causes at least 1% more influenza cases of death in the United States, which results in at least 700 extra deaths per year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":110},{"uri":"Hypothalamus","surface_form":"hypothalamus","offset":140},{"uri":"Thermoregulation","surface_form":"temperature","offset":176},{"uri":"Prostaglandin","surface_form":"prostaglandin","offset":198},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":384},{"uri":"Ibuprofen","surface_form":"ibuprofen","offset":402},{"uri":"Aspirin","surface_form":"aspirin","offset":416},{"uri":"Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs","surface_form":"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","offset":435},{"uri":"Analgesics","surface_form":"analgesics","offset":496},{"uri":"Acetaminophen","surface_form":"Acetaminophen","offset":568},{"uri":"Paracetamol","surface_form":"paracetamol","offset":586},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune response","offset":745},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":790},{"uri":"Influenza","surface_form":"influenza","offset":852}]}
