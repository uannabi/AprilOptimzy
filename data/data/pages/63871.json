{"id":63871,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Hahn","text":"Hilary Hahn (born November 27, 1979) is an American Grammy Award\u2013winning violinist.\nBiography.\nShe was born into a Lutheran family and moved to Baltimore, Maryland at the age of three and began playing the violin one month before her fourth birthday in the Suzuki Program of Baltimore\u2019s Peabody Conservatory.\nHahn became interested in the violin after taking a walk with her father in their Baltimore neighborhood (Zaustinsky 1999). The two passed a branch of the Peabody Conservatory that advertised music lessons for four-year-olds and observed a music lesson where a young boy was playing \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\". Hahn began taking lessons the following week and participated in a Suzuki class for about a year.\nIn 1995 Hahn made her international debut in Germany with a performance of the Beethoven Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D Major with Lorin Maazel and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. The concert was broadcast on radio and television throughout Europe. A year later, Hahn debuted at Carnegie Hall in New York as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra.\nBy the age of sixteen, Hahn had completed the Curtis Institute's university requirements, but elected to remain at the Institute for several more years to pursue additional elective courses, until her graduation in May 1999 with a Bachelor Of Music degree. During this time she regularly coached violin with Jaime Laredo, and studied chamber music with Felix Galimir and Gary Graffman. In an interview with PBS in December 2001, Hahn stated that of all the musical disciplines, she is most interested in musical performance (PBS Interview).\nHahn has played with orchestras such as the London Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, just to name a few. She debuted with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in March 2007.\nShe began performing and touring in a crossover duo with singer-songwriter Josh Ritter in 2005 and (early 2007) with singer-songwriter Tom Brosseau.\nCareer.\nIn 2001, Time Magazine named Hahn as \u201CAmerica\u2019s Best\u201D young classical musician. Throughout her career, Hahn has performed with numerous orchestras around the globe. She previously recorded five albums with Sony Classical, but now records exclusively for Deutsche Grammophon.\nIn 1996 Sony Music signed Hahn to an exclusive recording contract, which made her one of the youngest exclusive artists in the label\u2019s history. Hahn\u2019s first recording, released in 1997, featured selected solo sonatas and partitas by J.S. Bach, and spent weeks as a bestseller on the Billboard classical charts.\nIn addition to being a solo violinist, Hahn has also performed as a chamber musician. Since the summer of 1992 she has performed nearly every year with the Skaneateles Chamber Music Festival in Skaneateles, New York. Between 1995 and 2000 she spent performing and studying chamber music at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont, and in 1996 she served as an artist and a member of the chamber music mentoring program of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.\nFrom Sony Classical to Deutsche Grammophon.\nHahn signed with Deutsche Grammophon in 2003 after her contract with Sony expired in 2002. After Hahn completed her part of the contract with Sony, which was for five recordings over six years, she decided against renewing the contract due to the fact that she and Sony did not agree on her future projects (Lark Ascending).\nPersonal.\nIn an interview with \"Strings Magazine\" conducted in 1999, Hahn cited several people as being influential on her development as a musician and a student. Two of these influences include David Zinman, the conductor of the Baltimore Symphony and Hahn\u2019s mentor since she was ten, and Lorin Maazel, with whom she worked in Europe with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. In the interview, Hahn also stated that she enjoys watching movies, reading, and writing in her free time. Other hobbies that she lists include: meeting new people, exploring cities, ballet, working out, swimming, and bike riding. She also enjoys animals and rowing (The Daily Princetonian).\nWhat she plays.\nHilary Hahn plays an 1864 Vuillaume violin(II Cannone Guarneri copy) that was formerly owned by the Russian violinist Samuel Lande who was a friend of Klara Berkovich, Hahn\u2019s first teacher. Hahn uses Dominant strings and bows by French bow makers Paul Jombar and Emil Miquel (Zaustinsky 1999). But now, she plays on the 1865 Vuillaume violin(Alard Stradivarius copy) which she bought at Tarisio Auctions.\nOn playing Bach.\n\"Bach is, for me, the touchstone that keeps my playing honest. Keeping the intonation pure in double stops, bringing out the various voices where the phrasing requires it, crossing the strings so that there are not inadvertent accents, presenting the structure in such a way that it's clear to the listener without being pedantic - one can't fake things in Bach, and if one gets all of them to work, the music sings in the most wonderful way.\"\n[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4107716 Musicians in Their Own Words]","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":43},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":52},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":73},{"uri":"Lutheran","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":115},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore, Maryland","offset":144},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":206},{"uri":"Suzuki_method","surface_form":"Suzuki","offset":257},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":275},{"uri":"Peabody_Conservatory","surface_form":"Peabody Conservatory","offset":287},{"uri":"Twinkle_Twinkle_Little_Star","surface_form":"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star","offset":593},{"uri":"Ludwig_van_Beethoven","surface_form":"Beethoven","offset":800},{"uri":"Lorin_Maazel","surface_form":"Lorin Maazel","offset":860},{"uri":"Bavarian_Radio_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra","offset":881},{"uri":"Carnegie_Hall","surface_form":"Carnegie Hall","offset":1015},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":1032},{"uri":"Philadelphia_Orchestra","surface_form":"Philadelphia Orchestra","offset":1063},{"uri":"Jaime_Laredo","surface_form":"Jaime Laredo","offset":1395},{"uri":"Felix_Galimir","surface_form":"Felix Galimir","offset":1440},{"uri":"Gary_Graffman","surface_form":"Gary Graffman","offset":1458},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":1494},{"uri":"London_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"London Symphony Orchestra","offset":1672},{"uri":"New_York_Philharmonic","surface_form":"New York Philharmonic","offset":1699},{"uri":"Singapore_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"Singapore Symphony Orchestra","offset":1722},{"uri":"Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"Chicago Symphony Orchestra","offset":1793},{"uri":"Crossover_(music)","surface_form":"crossover","offset":1873},{"uri":"Singer-songwriter","surface_form":"singer-songwriter","offset":1892},{"uri":"Josh_Ritter","surface_form":"Josh Ritter","offset":1910},{"uri":"Singer-songwriter","surface_form":"singer-songwriter","offset":1952},{"uri":"Tom_Brosseau","surface_form":"Tom Brosseau","offset":1970},{"uri":"Time_Magazine","surface_form":"Time Magazine","offset":2001},{"uri":"Sony","surface_form":"Sony","offset":2198},{"uri":"Deutsche_Grammophon","surface_form":"Deutsche Grammophon","offset":2246},{"uri":"Sony_Music","surface_form":"Sony Music","offset":2275},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"J.S.
