{"id":639173,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water","text":"e=\"preserve\">Heavy water (deuterium oxide,) is a form of water based on deuterium.\nIt has a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (or D, also known as \"heavy hydrogen\"). Ordinary water has the common hydrogen-1 isotope (or H, also called \"protium\"). This makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal \"light water\". Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator in some nuclear reactors, such as CANDU reactors. It is a more efficient neutron moderator than regular water, allowing the use of unenriched uranium as fuel. Pure heavy water is not radioactive, but heavy water that has been through a nuclear reactor is slightly radioactive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Water_(molecule)","surface_form":"water","offset":57},{"uri":"Deuterium","surface_form":"deuterium","offset":72},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":125},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":134},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":419},{"uri":"Neutron_moderator","surface_form":"neutron moderator","offset":535},{"uri":"Nuclear_reactor","surface_form":"nuclear reactor","offset":561},{"uri":"CANDU","surface_form":"CANDU","offset":587},{"uri":"Uranium","surface_form":"uranium","offset":695},{"uri":"Radioactive_decay","surface_form":"radioactive","offset":736}]}
