{"id":639179,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahomet%2C_Illinois","text":"Mahomet is a town in Champaign County, Illinois, United States. The population was 7,258 at the 2010 census. Mahomet is about ten miles northwest of the city of Champaign. Interstate 74 and Illinois Route 47 meet in the town. Mahomet has two ZIP codes: 61840 and 61875.\nHistory.\nBefore the first European settlers came, the area around the Sangamon River that became Mahomet was inhabited by Kickapoo and Pottawattami Indians.\nIn 1836, Daniel T. Porter laid out a village plan. That is where Mahomet is now.\nMahomet was first called Middletown. This was presumably because it is half-way point between Bloomington and Danville. But there was another Middletown in Illinois. Therefore, in the mid-19th century, the name was changed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":13},{"uri":"Champaign_County%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Champaign County","offset":21},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":39},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":49},{"uri":"Champaign%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Champaign","offset":161},{"uri":"Sangamon_River","surface_form":"Sangamon River","offset":340},{"uri":"Kickapoo","surface_form":"Kickapoo","offset":392},{"uri":"Pottawattami","surface_form":"Pottawattami","offset":405},{"uri":"Bloomington%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Bloomington","offset":602},{"uri":"Danville%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Danville","offset":618}]}
