The type species is \"Bagualosaurus agudoensis \"and was described in 2018.\n\"Bagualosaurus\" lived about 223.23-230 million years ago.\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe holotype specimen, consisting of a partial skull and jaw, twelve back vertebrae, two tail vertebrae, two chevrons, a pelvis, two partial hindlimbs annd five fragmentary ribs, was discovered on a ravine at the edge of a pond in rural Agudo in 2007. The fossil was kept in a closet of the Laboratory of Paleovertebrates of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul South, under the tutelage of Professor Cesar Schultz. This is what is commonly called \"drawer paleontology\". The fossil was described as a sauropodomorph on May 25, 2018.\nSize.\nIt grew to about 2.5 meters (8.2\u00A0ft) long and about 1.3 (4.2\u00A0ft) long.\nDiet.\n\"Bagualosaurus\" probably had a fully herbivourus diet. The fact that the \"Bagualosaurus\" already has a dentition well adapted to the consumption of vegetation is especially important for the evolutionary history of the dinosaurs. Pretto explains that all sauropods have two characteristics in common: gigantism and herbivorism. \"Bagualosaurus\" and other early sauropodomorphs may have adopted the leaf diet, which may have been the source of sauropod gigantism.\nPaleoecology.\n\"Bagualosaurus\" lived in the Santa Maria Formaiton alongside an unnamed prosauropod and genera such as the carnivourus sauropodomorph \"Buriolestes, \"the proterochampsid \"Cerritosaurus\" and the possible theropod \"Staurikosaurus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sauropodomorpha","surface_form":"sauropodomorph","offset":46},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":61},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":124},{"uri":"Prosauropod","surface_form":"prosauropod","offset":1457},{"uri":"Buriolestes","surface_form":"Buriolestes","offset":1520},{"uri":"Proterochampsidae","surface_form":"proterochampsid","offset":1538},{"uri":"Cerritosaurus","surface_form":"Cerritosaurus","offset":1555},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":1587},{"uri":"Staurikosaurus","surface_form":"Staurikosaurus","offset":1597}]}
