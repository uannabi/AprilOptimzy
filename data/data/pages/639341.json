{"id":639341,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinsaurus","text":"\"Darwinsaurus\" (meaning \"Darwin's lizard\") is an ornithopod dinosaur once wrongly described as \"Iguanodon\".\nIn the early nineteenth century dinosaur remains were discovered near Hastings in East Sussex. These were first reported by Richard Owen in 1842. In 1889 they were referred to \"Iguanodon fittoni\" by Richard Lydekker. They were then assigned to \"Hypselospinus fittoni\" by David B. Norman in 2010.\nIn 2012 Gregory S. Paul named them as a separate genus and species. The type species is \"Darwinsaurus evolutionis\". The generic name honours Charles Darwin for his theory of evolution. The first fossil described as \"Darwinsaurus\" is known from a partial skeleton.\nPaul's decision is being challenged, and the present account may need be changed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ornithopod","surface_form":"ornithopod","offset":49},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":60},{"uri":"Iguanodon","surface_form":"Iguanodon","offset":96},{"uri":"Hastings","surface_form":"Hastings","offset":178},{"uri":"East_Sussex","surface_form":"East Sussex","offset":190},{"uri":"Richard_Owen","surface_form":"Richard Owen","offset":232},{"uri":"Iguanodon","surface_form":"Iguanodon","offset":285},{"uri":"Richard_Lydekker","surface_form":"Richard Lydekker","offset":307},{"uri":"Hypselospinus","surface_form":"Hypselospinus","offset":353},{"uri":"David_B._Norman","surface_form":"David B.
