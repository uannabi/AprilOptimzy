{"id":639549,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Sweden","text":"The Prime Minister (, literally \"Minister of the State\") is the head of government in Sweden. The office was created in 1876. Louis Gerhard De Geer, the architect behind the new bicameral Riksdag of 1866 that replaced the centuries-old Riksdag of the Estates, became the first officeholder in 1876.\nThe current Prime Minister of Sweden is Stefan L\u00F6fven, leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party.\nUntil 1974, the executive authority in Sweden had been exercised through the King in Council. Constitutional reform provided a new Instrument of Government which \"de jure\" established the parliamentary system and created a cabinet government with constitutional powers not derived from the Crown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":64},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":86},{"uri":"Louis_Gerhard_De_Geer","surface_form":"Louis Gerhard De Geer","offset":126},{"uri":"Riksdag","surface_form":"Riksdag","offset":188},{"uri":"Riksdag_of_the_Estates","surface_form":"Riksdag of the Estates","offset":236},{"uri":"Stefan_L%C3%B6fven","surface_form":"Stefan L\u00F6fven","offset":339},{"uri":"Swedish_Social_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Swedish Social Democratic Party","offset":368},{"uri":"King_in_Council_(Sweden)","surface_form":"King in Council","offset":478},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":495},{"uri":"Constitution_of_Sweden","surface_form":"Instrument of Government","offset":532},{"uri":"De_jure","surface_form":"de jure","offset":564},{"uri":"Parliamentary_system","surface_form":"parliamentary system","offset":589},{"uri":"Cabinet_government","surface_form":"cabinet government","offset":624}]}
