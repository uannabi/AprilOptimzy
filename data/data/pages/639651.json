{"id":639651,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(musical_instrument)","text":"The serpent is an ancient, low-sounding wind instrument in an 'S' shape. It looks a bit like a snake or serpent. It is made of wood, but had a mouthpiece similar to a trumpet and is classified as a brass instrument. The serpent has a range from C below the bass clef to around F above middle C. It was perhaps invented by Frenchman, Edme Guillaume, in the late 1500s. It made a comeback in the late 1800s and can be heard in Berlioz' \"Symphonie Fantastique\".\nThe nearest musical instrument to the serpent is the ophicleide, which replaced it in the 19th century. Its place was taken later on by valved bass brass instruments such as the euphonium and tuba.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wind_instrument","surface_form":"wind instrument","offset":40},{"uri":"Trumpet","surface_form":"trumpet","offset":167},{"uri":"Brass_instrument","surface_form":"brass instrument","offset":198},{"uri":"Bass_clef","surface_form":"bass clef","offset":257},{"uri":"Berlioz","surface_form":"Berlioz","offset":425},{"uri":"Symphonie_Fantastique","surface_form":"Symphonie Fantastique","offset":435},{"uri":"Ophicleide","surface_form":"ophicleide","offset":512},{"uri":"Euphonium","surface_form":"euphonium","offset":637},{"uri":"Tuba","surface_form":"tuba","offset":651}]}
