{"id":639760,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem","text":"e=\"preserve\">Arrow's impossibility theorem, Arrow's theorem, or Arrow's paradox is a statement from social choice theory, named after economist Kenneth Arrow, who first described it in 1950: Suppose there is a vote, and voters have at least three different options to choose from. Each voter will then rank the options according to his or her preference. Arrow said, that in such a case, there is no way to convert these rankings into a community-wide complete and transitive ranking while also meeting certain criteria.\nArrow demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis. He popularized it in his 1951 book \"Social Choice and Individual Values\". The original paper was titled \"A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Social_choice_theory","surface_form":"social choice theory","offset":100},{"uri":"Economist","surface_form":"economist","offset":134},{"uri":"Kenneth_Arrow","surface_form":"Kenneth Arrow","offset":144},{"uri":"Social_Choice_and_Individual_Values","surface_form":"Social Choice and Individual Values","offset":612}]}
