{"id":639768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Outfit","text":"The Chicago Outfit (also known as the Outfit, the Chicago Mafia, the Chicago Mob, or The Organization) is an Italian-American organized crime syndicate based in Chicago, Illinois, which dates back to the 1910s. It is part of the American Mafia originating in Chicago's South Side.\nThe Outfit rose to power in the 1920s, under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.\nThe Outfit did not have a monopoly on organized crime in Chicago, but they were by far the most powerful, violent and largest criminal organization in the Midwest. The Outfit's influence, at its peak, stretched as far away as California and Florida. Higher law enforcement attention and general attrition led to the Outfit's gradual decline since the late 20th century.\nFrom 1997 until his death in May 2018, the Chicago Outfit was believed to be led by John DiFronzo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organized_crime","surface_form":"organized crime","offset":126},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":161},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":170},{"uri":"American_Mafia","surface_form":"American Mafia","offset":229},{"uri":"South_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago's South Side","offset":259},{"uri":"Johnny_Torrio","surface_form":"Johnny Torrio","offset":341},{"uri":"Al_Capone","surface_form":"Al Capone","offset":359},{"uri":"John_DiFronzo","surface_form":"John DiFronzo","offset":925}]}
