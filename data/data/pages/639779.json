He was born in Arequipa as the son of Josefina Alvizuri Bustamente and Juan Manuel L\u00F3pez. He received his Bachelor from King's College. He married Josefa Castresana in 1877 and had three kids, Carlos, Eduardo, and Hortensia.\nDuring the Pacific War, he organized the \"Battle of Tambo valley\", where, as a commander of the Vanguard division, he prevented the Chilean enemies from leaving. He was also a Colonel in \"Moliendo\". Furthermore, he was the President of the Liberal Club, director of the Society of Public Welfare of Arequipa (1889-1895) and engineer in his municipality. In 1895, he gave a service that gave drinkable water to his hometown, and, after Pi\u00E9rola's revolution earlier that year, decided to arrive on the political scene. He was put on Congress as a deputy of his hometown, Arequipa. He was elected to the first vice-presidency of his house, and enacted the ministry portfolio of Development January, 1896. From this position, he helped irrigation systems, roads, mining extractions, and even industry. In 1897 he was elected Mayor of Arequipa, of which he did an excellent job, as he gave Arequipa urban planning and road works. He returned to congress again in 1898, and was a senator in 1899.\nWhen the government of Pi\u00E9rola ceased, he was made a presidential candidate of the civil-democratic alliance to the first magistracy of the nation. His character traits were considered ideal for the presidency, since he was not boisterous, and a hard worker for his people.\nDuring his presidency, he enacted many things to help the poor and foreigners. He strongly advised and built his presidency around agricultural economic development, even erecting a school for it with help from Belgium. He made a new Water Code in 1902, which gave an equitable amount of water based on how much water was needed, and got rid of the law that forbid foreigners to purchase land. Furthermore, he got American Investors to come and create the \"Cerro de Pasco\" mining company, which boosted both country-wide and city-wide economic growth. As well, a railroad was built from La \"Oroya\" to \"Cerro de Pasco\", and inner-Andean zones were advised to be colonized.\nIn terms of international politics, Peru was struggling with Chile, as Chileans were using a process called \"Chileanization\" to take areas of land on the Peru-Chile border, such as \"Tacna\" and \"Arica\"; Peruvian cities. The Roma\u00F1a government had to also face problems with Ecuador.\nHe died May 26, 1912, in the spa of Yura.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_Peru","surface_form":"President of Peru","offset":49},{"uri":"Arequipa","surface_form":"Arequipa","offset":105},{"uri":"Pacific_War","surface_form":"Pacific War","offset":326},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":639},{"uri":"Yura%2C_Arequipa","surface_form":"Yura","offset":2569}]}
