{"id":639787,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oobi","text":"Reception.\n\"Oobi\" got high TV ratings for Noggin. From 2003 to 2004, \"Oobi\" and two other shows\u2014\"Miffy\" and \"Connie the Cow\"\u2014made Noggin's daily viewers increase by 55% over the last year. The average number of preschool-age children watching \"Oobi\" grew by 43% during the same time. The show's ratings were reported in the newspaper Multichannel News by the author Mike Reynolds, who said Noggin's popularity could be traced to its \"breakout original series \"Oobi\".\" The first showing of the \"Uma Preschool!\" episode on September 6, 2004, got higher ratings than any other Noggin show ever did.\nWhen \"Oobi\" was still being played on TV, it had a cult following of Muppets fans and small filmmakers who made their own \"Oobi\" puppets. In 2003, the \"Boston Herald\" newspaper said that \"Oobi\" was \"already very popular\" with \"those of the Muppet generation.\" A worker for Noggin, Tom Ascheim, said in the same article that Oobi \"gets fan mail,\" and he thought it was an interesting idea for a show because \"everybody has an Oobi in their hand.\" In 2004, the magazine \"The Melbourne Age\" said that \"the show - the work of various \"Sesame Street\" alumni - is developing a strong cult following; the real Uma [Thurman] is said to be a fan of hand Uma.\" An internet catalog of \"Oobi\" puppets and eyes, OobiEyes.com, was online from 2006 to 2013. A small group of YouTube.com users who made fan films with \"Oobi\" puppets existed during the early years of the website, and OobiEyes.com held an advertising campaign with YouTube in 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Multichannel_News","surface_form":"Multichannel News","offset":334},{"uri":"Cult_following","surface_form":"cult following","offset":647},{"uri":"Muppets","surface_form":"Muppets","offset":665},{"uri":"Boston_Herald","surface_form":"Boston Herald","offset":748},{"uri":"The_Age","surface_form":"The Melbourne Age","offset":1065},{"uri":"Online_shopping","surface_form":"internet catalog","offset":1250},{"uri":"YouTube.com","surface_form":"YouTube.com","offset":1356}]}
