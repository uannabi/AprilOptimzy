{"id":639943,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_UEFA_Europa_League","text":"The 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League was the 47th season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 9th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League.\nThe last game was played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in D\u00E9cines-Charpieu, France. Atl\u00E9tico Madrid won against Marseille to win their third Europa League title.\nAs winners, Atl\u00E9tico Madrid played against the winners of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. They also automatically qualified for the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League group stage, but since they had already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the third-placed team of the 2017\u201318 Ligue 1.\nManchester United qualified for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League as winners of the Europa League. They were unable to defend their title as they qualified for the Champions League knockout phase.\nTeams.\nNotably two teams take part in the competition that are not playing in their national top division, Tirana (2nd tier) and Vaduz (representing Liechtenstein, playing in Swiss 2nd tier).\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nMatches in the qualifying, play-off, and knockout rounds may also be played on Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of the regular Thursdays due to scheduling conflicts.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 25 August 2017, 13:00 CEST, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The 48 teams were drawn into twelve groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association cannot be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on their 2017 UEFA club coefficients.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 32, where they were joined by the eight third-placed teams of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League group stage. The matchdays were 14 September, 28 September, 19 October, 2 November, 23 November, and 7 December 2017.\nStatistics.\nStatistics do not include the qualifying rounds and play-off round.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":78},{"uri":"UEFA","surface_form":"UEFA","offset":111},{"uri":"UEFA_Europa_League","surface_form":"UEFA Europa League","offset":182},{"uri":"2018_UEFA_Europa_League_Final","surface_form":"last game","offset":206},{"uri":"Parc_Olympique_Lyonnais","surface_form":"Parc Olympique Lyonnais","offset":234},{"uri":"D%C3%A9cines-Charpieu","surface_form":"D\u00E9cines-Charpieu","offset":261},{"uri":"Atl%C3%A9tico_Madrid","surface_form":"Atl\u00E9tico Madrid","offset":287},{"uri":"Olympique_de_Marseille","surface_form":"Marseille","offset":315},{"uri":"2017%E2%80%9318_UEFA_Champions_League","surface_form":"2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League","offset":427},{"uri":"Real_Madrid_C.F.","surface_form":"Real Madrid","offset":458},{"uri":"2018_UEFA_Super_Cup","surface_form":"2018 UEFA Super Cup","offset":478},{"uri":"2018%E2%80%9319_UEFA_Champions_League","surface_form":"2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League","offset":541},{"uri":"2017%E2%80%9318_Ligue_1","surface_form":"2017\u201318 Ligue 1","offset":716},{"uri":"Manchester_United_F.C.","surface_form":"Manchester United","offset":733},{"uri":"2017%E2%80%9318_UEFA_Champions_League","surface_form":"2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League","offset":769},{"uri":"KF_Tirana","surface_form":"Tirana","offset":1037},{"uri":"2017%E2%80%9318_Albanian_First_Division","surface_form":"2nd tier","offset":1045},{"uri":"FC_Vaduz","surface_form":"Vaduz","offset":1059},{"uri":"2017%E2%80%9318_Swiss_Challenge_League","surface_form":"Swiss 2nd tier","offset":1105},{"uri":"Nyon","surface_form":"Nyon","offset":1238},{"uri":"Central_European_Summer_Time","surface_form":"CEST","offset":1523},{"uri":"Grimaldi_Forum","surface_form":"Grimaldi Forum","offset":1536},{"uri":"Round-robin_tournament","surface_form":"round-robin format","offset":1869}]}
