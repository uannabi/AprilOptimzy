The colouring and style of the dress gives the effect of a one-piece garment. A dress is also known as a frock or a gown. In Europe and the Americas, dresses are worn by females of all ages as an alternative to a separate skirt and blouse or trousers.\nThere are many types of dresses. A dress is usually worn at formal occasions, such as a wedding or a dance. It is also worn in the summer to keep cool. Younger females tend to prefer shorter skirts than older females.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":45},{"uri":"Skirt","surface_form":"skirt","offset":76},{"uri":"Bodice","surface_form":"bodice","offset":113},{"uri":"Frock","surface_form":"frock","offset":237},{"uri":"Gown","surface_form":"gown","offset":248},{"uri":"Blouse","surface_form":"blouse","offset":364},{"uri":"Trousers","surface_form":"trousers","offset":374},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":472},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":485}]}
