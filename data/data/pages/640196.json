He worked closely with the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and with Druid Theatre, Galway. He was born in County Galway, Ireland and later lived in Dublin.\nMurphy's first successful play, \"A Whistle in the Dark\", was performed at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in London in 1961. It was very controversial. He also wrote \"The Sanctuary Lamp\", \"Famine\", \"The Gigli Concert\", and \"Conversations on a Homecoming\". He wrote one novel, \"The Seduction of Morality\" (1994).\nMurphy died on 15 May 2018 in Dublin at the age of 83. President Michael D. Higgins said: \u201CThe importance of Tom Murphy\u2019s contribution to Irish theatre is immeasurable and outstanding. We have had no greater use of language for the stage than in the body of work produced by Tom Murphy since his earliest work in the 1960s.\u201D","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abbey_Theatre","surface_form":"Abbey Theatre","offset":109},{"uri":"Druid_Theatre","surface_form":"Druid Theatre","offset":142},{"uri":"County_Galway","surface_form":"County Galway","offset":180},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":222},{"uri":"A_Whistle_in_the_Dark","surface_form":"A Whistle in the Dark","offset":263},{"uri":"Theatre_Royal_Stratford_East","surface_form":"Theatre Royal Stratford East","offset":308},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":340},{"uri":"The_Sanctuary_Lamp","surface_form":"The Sanctuary Lamp","offset":398},{"uri":"The_Gigli_Concert","surface_form":"The Gigli Concert","offset":430},{"uri":"Conversations_on_a_Homecoming","surface_form":"Conversations on a Homecoming","offset":455},{"uri":"President_of_Ireland","surface_form":"President","offset":598},{"uri":"Michael_D._Higgins","surface_form":"Michael D.
