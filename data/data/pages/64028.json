In Greek mythology, Cronus and Perseus did this.\nA sickle and a hammer are the symbols of the Soviet Union.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":29},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":42},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":69},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":75},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":120},{"uri":"Blade","surface_form":"blade","offset":161},{"uri":"Saw","surface_form":"saw","offset":371},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":408},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":419},{"uri":"Cronus","surface_form":"Cronus","offset":436},{"uri":"Perseus","surface_form":"Perseus","offset":447},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":480},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":510}]}
