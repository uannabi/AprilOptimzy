{"id":64042,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk8er_Boi","text":"Sk8er Boi is a single by pop-punk singer Avril Lavigne. It is one of her most famous songs.\nSong information.\nIn this song, she tells the story of a relationship between a \"sk8er boi\" (skater boy) and a more preppy girl who does ballet. Although both of them \"want\" each other, the girl rejects him against her own secret feelings because of peer pressure. In the end, the skater boy becomes famous and is with another punk girl (Avril sings in that girl's point of view) who cares for him, leaving the preppy girl behind.\nMusic video.\nThe music video begins with what may be the \"Sk8er Boi\" in the alley of a city with a bunch of spray paint on the ground. The music video goes along with posters that have a star on them advertising a concert Avril hosts, where people use their cars and amplifiers to have the concert on the streets. The concert gets so wild the police come in trying to stop it. At the end of the video, Avril crashes her guitar into the car windshield. A police helicopter comes in, leaving a mystery as to what they will do.\nMovie adaptation.\nIn 2003, Paramount Pictures optioned the song for adaptation into a feature film. However, as of December 2006, the film has apparently been abandoned or is stuck in development hell.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":15},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":34},{"uri":"Avril_Lavigne","surface_form":"Avril Lavigne","offset":41},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":149},{"uri":"Skateboarding","surface_form":"skater","offset":185},{"uri":"Boy","surface_form":"boy","offset":192},{"uri":"Preppy","surface_form":"preppy","offset":208},{"uri":"Girl","surface_form":"girl","offset":215},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":229},{"uri":"Rejection","surface_form":"rejects","offset":287},{"uri":"Secret","surface_form":"secret","offset":315},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"feeling","offset":322},{"uri":"Peer_pressure","surface_form":"peer pressure","offset":342},{"uri":"Celebrity","surface_form":"famous","offset":392},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":1069},{"uri":"Paramount_Pictures","surface_form":"Paramount Pictures","offset":1075},{"uri":"December","surface_form":"December","offset":1163},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1172},{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":1232},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"hell","offset":1244}]}
