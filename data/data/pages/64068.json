{"id":64068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene","text":"=\"preserve\">Acetylene is a hydrocarbon, belonging to the alkyne group. It is the simplest type of alkyne, as it has only two hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms. Acetylene is an unsaturated organic compound because its four atoms are triple bonded through a covalent bond. It was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy. The chemical symbol is C2H2.\n80% of all acetylene produced yearly in the United States is used for chemical synthesis. It is a toxic chemical; breathing the substance causes dizziness, headache and nausea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbon","offset":27},{"uri":"Alkyne","surface_form":"alkyne","offset":57},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":125},{"uri":"Atoms","surface_form":"atoms","offset":134},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":148},{"uri":"Saturation_(chemistry)","surface_form":"unsaturated","offset":178},{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":190},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalent bond","offset":258},{"uri":"Edmund_Davy","surface_form":"Edmund Davy","offset":302},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":388},{"uri":"Chemical_synthesis","surface_form":"chemical synthesis","offset":414}]}
