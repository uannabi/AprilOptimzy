{"id":640861,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh","text":"In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the human leg.\nThe single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Human_anatomy","surface_form":"human anatomy","offset":3},{"uri":"Hip","surface_form":"hip","offset":52},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":57},{"uri":"Knee","surface_form":"knee","offset":73},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"Anatomically","offset":79},{"uri":"Human_leg","surface_form":"human leg","offset":111},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":133},{"uri":"Femur","surface_form":"femur","offset":165},{"uri":"Bone_tissue","surface_form":"bone tissue","offset":238},{"uri":"Ball_and_socket_joint","surface_form":"ball and socket joint","offset":264},{"uri":"Hip","surface_form":"hip","offset":293},{"uri":"Hinge_joint","surface_form":"hinge joint","offset":313}]}
