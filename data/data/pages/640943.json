It had winds near.\nThe hurricane moved onto land near Wilmington, North Carolina. It then passed near Norfolk, Virginia. Then it moved through the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey just inland.\nOn September 3, the storm struck near Jamaica Bay (which later became a part of New York City).\nOn September 4, the hurricane was over New England.\nThe storm killed 22 people when it struck the Eastern United States.\nThe Swiss Re insurance company notes that a similar storm striking the East Coast of the United States would do more than $100 billion (and possibly as high as $200 billion) in damage if it struck. That's far more damage than was done when Hurricane Sandy struck New York and New Jersey. Sandy caused between $65 billion and $72 billion in damage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":81},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":118},{"uri":"Southeastern_United_States","surface_form":"Southeastern United States","offset":179},{"uri":"Wilmington%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Wilmington, North Carolina","offset":276},{"uri":"Norfolk%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Norfolk, Virginia","offset":324},{"uri":"Delmarva_Peninsula","surface_form":"Delmarva Peninsula","offset":369},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":392},{"uri":"New_England","surface_form":"New England","offset":551},{"uri":"East_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"East Coast of the United States","offset":704},{"uri":"Hurricane_Sandy_(2012)","surface_form":"Hurricane Sandy","offset":873}]}
