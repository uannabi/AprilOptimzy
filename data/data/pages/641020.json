He made advancements in physical optics, including diffraction, coherence properties of optical fields, spectroscopy of partially coherent radiation, and the theory of direct scattering and inverse scattering. He he co-wrote \"Principles of Optics\" of one of the standard textbooks of optics commonly known as \"Born and Wolf\".\nWolf died in Rochester, New York on June 2, 2018, aged 95.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":80},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":106},{"uri":"Optics","surface_form":"optics","offset":147},{"uri":"Diffraction","surface_form":"diffraction","offset":165},{"uri":"Coherence_(physics)","surface_form":"coherence","offset":178},{"uri":"Field_(physics)","surface_form":"fields","offset":210},{"uri":"Spectroscopy","surface_form":"spectroscopy","offset":218},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":253},{"uri":"Direct_scattering","surface_form":"direct scattering","offset":282},{"uri":"Inverse_scattering","surface_form":"inverse scattering","offset":304},{"uri":"Principles_of_Optics","surface_form":"Principles of Optics","offset":340},{"uri":"Rochester%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Rochester, New York","offset":453}]}
