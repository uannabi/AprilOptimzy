{"id":641061,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pride_Parade","text":"The Chicago Pride Parade, also (and formerly) called the Chicago Gay Pride Parade or PRIDE Chicago, is the annual pride parade held on the last Sunday of June in Lake View, Chicago, Illinois in the United States. It is funded and organized by the Chicago City Council and Mayor of Chicago. Chicago's Pride Parade is one of the largest, by attendance, in the world.\nThe first parade was organized on Saturday, June 27, 1970, as a march from Washington Square Park (\"Bughouse Square\") to the Water Tower, but then many of the participants marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza.\nFor many years, the parade was held only in Lake View East, a neighborhood in Chicago. Recent parades have expanded their routes by extending it to the Uptown neighborhood, beginning at the corner of Broadway and Montrose. The parade then goes south on Broadway to Halsted, continues south on Halsted to Belmont, then east on Belmont to Broadway and finally south again on Broadway to Cannon Drive and Lincoln Park.\nIn June 2017, the Grand Marshall of the parade was Lea DeLaria and over 1,000,000 attended the parade.\nThere was no parade in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It returns in 2021.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pride_parade","surface_form":"pride parade","offset":114},{"uri":"Lake_View%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Lake View","offset":162},{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":173},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":182},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":198},{"uri":"Chicago_City_Council","surface_form":"Chicago City Council","offset":247},{"uri":"Mayor_of_Chicago","surface_form":"Mayor of Chicago","offset":272},{"uri":"Washington_Square_Park_(Chicago)","surface_form":"Washington Square Park","offset":440},{"uri":"Chicago_Water_Tower","surface_form":"Water Tower","offset":490},{"uri":"Richard_J._Daley_Center","surface_form":"Civic Center (now Richard J.
