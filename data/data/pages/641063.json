{"id":641063,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Historic_District_(Chicago)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Gold Coast Historic District is a historic district in Chicago, Illinois, located in Chicago's Near North Side community area. It is roughly bounded by North Avenue, Lake Shore Drive, Oak Street, and Clark Street.\nThe Gold Coast neighborhood grew in the wake of the Great Chicago Fire.\nIn 1882, millionaire Potter Palmer moved to the area from the Prairie Avenue neighborhood on the city's south side. He filled in a swampy area which later became Lake Shore Drive. Other wealthy Chicagoans followed Potter into the neighborhood, which became one of the richest in Chicago.\nThe district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\nAs of 2011, Gold Coast ranks as the 7th richest urban neighborhood in America with a median household income of $153,358.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":72},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":81},{"uri":"Near_North_Side%2C_Chicago","surface_form":"Near North Side","offset":112},{"uri":"North_Avenue_(Chicago)","surface_form":"North Avenue","offset":169},{"uri":"Lake_Shore_Drive","surface_form":"Lake Shore Drive","offset":183},{"uri":"Oak_Street_(Chicago)","surface_form":"Oak Street","offset":201},{"uri":"Clark_Street_(Chicago)","surface_form":"Clark Street","offset":217},{"uri":"Great_Chicago_Fire","surface_form":"Great Chicago Fire","offset":283},{"uri":"Potter_Palmer","surface_form":"Potter Palmer","offset":324},{"uri":"Prairie_Avenue","surface_form":"Prairie Avenue","offset":365},{"uri":"National_Register_of_Historic_Places","surface_form":"National Register of Historic Places","offset":621},{"uri":"List_of_highest-income_urban_neighborhoods_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"7th richest urban neighborhood","offset":703},{"uri":"America","surface_form":"America","offset":737}]}
