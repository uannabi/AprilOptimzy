{"id":641080,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Irving_Plaza","text":"Harlem Irving Plaza (commonly referred to as \"The HIP\") is an enclosed mall located in Norridge, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The mall features over 100 stores and a food court; anchor stores include Carson's, Kohl's, Best Buy, and Target. It is one of the oldest shopping malls in the Chicago area.\nOriginally a farm, Harlem Irving Plaza opened in 1956 as a strip mall featuring approximately 45 tenants.\nBetween 1975 and 1979, the former strip mall was enclosed, and a parking garage was added. Also in 1979, Madigan's was added to the roster of department stores.\nIn 1988, Kohl's acquired and converted all of the stores in the MainStreet chain; Carson Pirie Scott opened in the former Wieboldt's the same year. A food court was added in 1996, and Best Buy opened in the former Madigan's. Best Buy re-located to the mall's parking lot in 2001; its original location was replaced with a second parking garage.\nIn 2013, the mall underwent another expansion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Enclosed_mall","surface_form":"enclosed mall","offset":62},{"uri":"Norridge%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Norridge, Illinois","offset":87},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":119},{"uri":"Food_court","surface_form":"food court","offset":168},{"uri":"Anchor_store","surface_form":"anchor store","offset":180},{"uri":"Carson%27s","surface_form":"Carson's","offset":202},{"uri":"Kohl%27s","surface_form":"Kohl's","offset":212},{"uri":"Best_Buy","surface_form":"Best Buy","offset":220},{"uri":"Target_Corporation","surface_form":"Target","offset":234},{"uri":"Strip_mall","surface_form":"strip mall","offset":361},{"uri":"Parking_garage","surface_form":"parking garage","offset":473},{"uri":"Kohl%27s","surface_form":"Kohl's","offset":578},{"uri":"Carson_Pirie_Scott","surface_form":"Carson Pirie Scott","offset":651},{"uri":"Food_court","surface_form":"food court","offset":719},{"uri":"Best_Buy","surface_form":"Best Buy","offset":753}]}
