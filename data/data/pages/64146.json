{"id":64146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine","text":"Phosphine is a chemical compound. Its chemical name is phosphorus hydride. Its chemical formula is PH3. It is also called phosphane and phosphamine. It contains phosphide and hydrogen ions.\nProperties.\nIt is a colorless, flammable gas. It is highly toxic; it can easily kill, even when concentration levels are low. It smells like fish. It can ignite without a spark. When it burns, it makes a white cloud of phosphorus(V) oxide, which is irritating.\nPreparation.\nIt is made when hypophosphites and phosphites are heated. It is also made when white phosphorus reacts with warm alkali.\nUses.\nThe gas is used for pest control. It is also used in making semiconductors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":15},{"uri":"Phosphide","surface_form":"phosphide","offset":161},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":175},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":184},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":210},{"uri":"Flammable","surface_form":"flammable","offset":221},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":249},{"uri":"Concentration","surface_form":"concentration","offset":286},{"uri":"Phosphorus(V)_oxide","surface_form":"phosphorus(V) oxide","offset":409},{"uri":"Hypophosphite","surface_form":"hypophosphite","offset":480},{"uri":"Phosphite","surface_form":"phosphite","offset":499},{"uri":"White_phosphorus","surface_form":"white phosphorus","offset":543},{"uri":"Alkali","surface_form":"alkali","offset":577},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pest control","offset":611},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":651}]}
