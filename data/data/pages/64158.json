{"id":64158,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum","text":"Lorem ipsum is a dummy text used to replace text in some areas just for the purpose of an example. It can be used in publishing and graphic design. It is used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document, such as font, typography, and layout.\nBackground.\nThe lorem ipsum text is usually a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed to make it nonsensical. Lorem ipsum text is used in mock-ups of visual design projects before the actual words are put into the finished product. This is often called greeking. The text is derived from Cicero's \"De finibus bonorum et malorum\" (\"On the Ends of Goods and Evils\", sometimes the title is translated as \"[About] The Purposes of Good and Evil\"). The words \"Lorem ipsum...\" make no sense.\nThe text was frequently used in desktop publishing templates. To experiment with the text, it can be copy-pasted into the desktop publishing software, and the typeface and its setting can be tried out. The distribution of letters in Lorem Ipsum is close to that in English language. This way, you can see what your own text would look like in that graphic format.\nText.\nThere are many Lorem ipsum text generators available, including free versions and online sites. The algorithm and source files for some versions are in the public domain. Most generators will start the first paragraph with \"L\"orem ipsum dolor sit amet,\" \" and then words selected from its word list according to model sentence and paragraph structure rules, so as to approximate the distribution of English word, sentence and paragraph lengths.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishing","offset":117},{"uri":"Graphic_design","surface_form":"graphic design","offset":132},{"uri":"Graphic","surface_form":"graphic","offset":178},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":219},{"uri":"Typography","surface_form":"typography","offset":225},{"uri":"Page_layout","surface_form":"layout","offset":241},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":308},{"uri":"Cicero","surface_form":"Cicero","offset":322},{"uri":"Cicero","surface_form":"Cicero","offset":569},{"uri":"Desktop_publishing","surface_form":"desktop publishing","offset":798}]}
