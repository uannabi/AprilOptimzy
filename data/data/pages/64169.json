{"id":64169,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox","text":"Redox (shorthand for reduction/oxidation) describes all chemical reactions in which atoms have an increase or decrease in oxidation number (oxidation state).\nAn oxidation number is a number assigned to an element in chemical combination that represents the number of electrons lost (or gained, if the number is negative), by an atom of that element in the compound.\nWhether an electron is gained or lost can be easily memorised by the abbreviation OIL RIG, which stands for, \"Oxidation Is Loss,\" or losing electrons, and \"Reduction Is Gain,\" or gaining electrons. Redox reactions can also happen by sharing electrons to form a product by covalent bonding.\nIn an oxidation reduction reaction, the cation gives an electron to the anion because both ions will have a different charge to attract each other with. In an oxidation reduction reaction, the oxidizing reagent pulls an electron from the other atom to have a net positive charge. The reducing reagent gives an electron to have a net negative charge. However, there are exceptions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"chemical reaction","offset":56},{"uri":"Oxidation_number","surface_form":"oxidation number","offset":122},{"uri":"Oxidation_state","surface_form":"oxidation state","offset":140},{"uri":"Element","surface_form":"element","offset":205},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalent bonding","offset":638},{"uri":"Reagent","surface_form":"reagent","offset":859}]}
