{"id":641895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli","text":"\"Jus soli\" (), means \"right of the soil\". This is often called birthright citizenship. This is the right of anyone born in a country to have nationality or citizenship.\n\"Jus soli\" was part of the common law. It was different to \"jus sanguinis\", from the Roman law that became part of the civil-law systems of continental Europe. Where it exists, there are often conditions. For example, some countries deny citizenship to children of foreign diplomats.\nAlmost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of \"jus sanguinis\" (right of blood). Citizenship is inherited through parents not by birthplace. Sometimes it can be a version of \"jus soli\" in which citizenship by birthplace is automatic only for the children of certain immigrants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rights","surface_form":"right","offset":99},{"uri":"Nationality","surface_form":"nationality","offset":141},{"uri":"Citizenship","surface_form":"citizenship","offset":156},{"uri":"English_common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":196},{"uri":"Roman_law","surface_form":"Roman law","offset":254},{"uri":"Civil_law_(legal_system)","surface_form":"civil-law","offset":288},{"uri":"Continental_Europe","surface_form":"continental Europe","offset":309},{"uri":"Jus_sanguinis","surface_form":"jus sanguinis","offset":563}]}
