{"id":642046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome","text":"=\"preserve\">The transcriptome is the set of all RNA molecules in one cell or a population of cells. The point is that RNA transcribes the base sequence from DNA by the process called transcription. The term 'transcriptome' is sometimes used to refer to all RNAs, or just mRNA, depending on the particular experiment.\nIt includes only those RNA molecules found in a specified cell population, and usually includes the amount or concentration of each RNA molecule in addition to the molecular identities. In that way, it differs from the exome, which refers only to the bits of RNA which actually code for proteins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":48},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":52},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":69},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":157},{"uri":"Transcription_(genetics)","surface_form":"transcription","offset":183},{"uri":"MRNA","surface_form":"mRNA","offset":271},{"uri":"Exome","surface_form":"exome","offset":536},{"uri":"Proteins","surface_form":"proteins","offset":604}]}
