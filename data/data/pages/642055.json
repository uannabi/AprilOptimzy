{"id":642055,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage_theory_of_ageing","text":"e=\"preserve\">The DNA damage theory of ageing is that ageing happens because damage happens in the individual's DNA. The damage accumulates (builds up) even though there are cell mechanisms that repair most of the damage.\nAlthough both mitochondrial and the cell nucleus may have DNA damage, nuclear DNA is the main subject of this analysis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ageing","surface_form":"ageing","offset":53},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":111},{"uri":"Mitochondrion","surface_form":"mitochondrial","offset":235},{"uri":"Cell_nucleus","surface_form":"cell nucleus","offset":257}]}
