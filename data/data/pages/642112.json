{"id":642112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number","text":"Grammatical number is the way numbers and counting are fitted into sentences.\nMost languages have ways to express differences of number.\nCommon categories of grammatical number are singular (one) or plural (not one). Some languages, also have a notion of dual, for two, or paucal for \"a few\". Some languages (for example Chinese) do not have the concept of grammatical number. In these languages, numbers (or other quantifiers) are used, if necessary. Finally, there may be words which only have one form, or which are not countable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numbers","surface_form":"numbers","offset":30},{"uri":"Counting","surface_form":"counting","offset":42},{"uri":"Sentence","surface_form":"sentence","offset":67},{"uri":"Singular","surface_form":"singular","offset":181},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":199},{"uri":"Dual_(grammatical_number)","surface_form":"dual","offset":255},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":321}]}
