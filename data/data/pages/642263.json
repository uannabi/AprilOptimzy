Cancer found in the vagina may have come from the bladder, stomach and intestines.\nA tumor in the vagina can be solid or filled with fluid (or both).\nVaginal cancer is rare. It is an overgrowth of tissue in the vagina. Some benign tumor<nowiki/>s may turn into cancer.\nA vaginal tumor can cause bleeding, pain with sex and feelings of pressure. A tumor in the vagina is often found during a check up and pelvic exam. Doctors may order more tests like an ultrasound, CAT scan and MRI. Doctors will look at a piece of the tumor under a microscope to see what kind of tumor that it is.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tumor","surface_form":"tumor","offset":33},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":65},{"uri":"Bladder","surface_form":"bladder","offset":495},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":504},{"uri":"Vaginal_cancer","surface_form":"Vaginal cancer","offset":595},{"uri":"Benign_tumor","surface_form":"benign tumor","offset":669},{"uri":"Magnetic_resonance_imaging","surface_form":"MRI","offset":924}]}
