{"id":6423,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atum","text":"Atum was the creator of everything in ancient Egyptian mythology. He represented the very first history; nothing existed yet except for him. According to the myth, he rose up out of the chaotic waters of Nu and used his own female side to create Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture). For a while, his two children were lost at sea. Atum sent his removable eye, the Udjat Eye, to go look for them. When they returned, Atum cried tears of joy. Where these tears hit the ground is where men formed. Out of the two elements water and air, the other gods and goddesses were born. The Egyptians believed he was the father of all the gods.\nAtum was first the partner of the earth then the partner of the setting sun.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"Egyptian mythology","offset":46},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":96},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":158},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":574},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":622}]}
