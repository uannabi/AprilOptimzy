{"id":64291,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh","text":"Artsakh, officially the Republic of Artsakh (;,) or the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (), is a \"de facto\" independent republic in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the South Caucasus. It is internationally recognised to be part of Azerbaijan.\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh region has been populated by Armenians for a long time. The area has been disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan since 1918. After the Soviet Union established control over the area, in 1923 it formed the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR. In the final years of the Soviet Union, the region again became a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, resulting in the Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988\u20131994.\nOn 10 December 1991, a referendum was held in the NKAO and the neighboring Shahumian region. This resulted in a declaration of independence from Azerbaijan as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The country is not recognized by any UN member state, including Armenia. Representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have since been holding peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group.\nGeography.\nThe Artsakh Republic has a lot of mountains. It is in area, and borders Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. The highest peaks in the country are Mount Mrav, and Mount Kirs. The major rivers are the Terter and Khachen rivers. Most rivers in the country flow towards the Artsakh valley.\nThe climate in the Artsakh Republic is mild. It is foggy for over 100 days a year. More than 36% of the country is forested.\nDemographics.\nIn 2005, the country's population was 137,737. The ethnic composition was 137,380 (99.74%) Armenians, 171 (0.12%) Russians, 21 (0.02%) Ukrainians, 6 (0.00%) Azerbaijanis and 159 (0.12%) others.\nThe first demographic census in the Artsakh Republic took place in 1769. It was a letter from Heraclius II of Georgia to Russia's Petr Ivanovich Panin, and said, \"Seven families rule the region of Khamse. Its population is totally Armenian.\"\nIn 2014, the life expectancy for males was 71.6 years, and females 76.8 years.\nNearly all of the Azerbaijani population was killed or thrown out by Armenian forces since the war. Azerbaijani refugees who have survived not allowed to return and have become displaced.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":92},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":102},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":114},{"uri":"Nagorno-Karabakh","surface_form":"Nagorno-Karabakh","offset":130},{"uri":"South_Caucasus","surface_form":"South Caucasus","offset":161},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":224},{"uri":"Armenian_people","surface_form":"Armenians","offset":286},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":388},{"uri":"Nagorno-Karabakh_Autonomous_Oblast","surface_form":"Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast","offset":458},{"uri":"Azerbaijan_SSR","surface_form":"Azerbaijan SSR","offset":511},{"uri":"Nagorno-Karabakh_War","surface_form":"Nagorno-Karabakh War","offset":660},{"uri":"Shahumian","surface_form":"Shahumian","offset":772},{"uri":"Declaration_of_independence","surface_form":"declaration of independence","offset":809},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"UN","offset":924},{"uri":"OSCE","surface_form":"OSCE","offset":1073},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":1174},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":1199},{"uri":"Mount_Mrav","surface_form":"Mount Mrav","offset":1242},{"uri":"Mount_Kirs","surface_form":"Mount Kirs","offset":1258},{"uri":"Terter_river","surface_form":"Terter","offset":1295},{"uri":"Khachen_river","surface_form":"Khachen","offset":1306},{"uri":"Artsakh_valley","surface_form":"Artsakh valley","offset":1366},{"uri":"Fog","surface_form":"foggy","offset":1433},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forested","offset":1497},{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russians","offset":1635},{"uri":"Ukrainian_people","surface_form":"Ukrainians","offset":1656},{"uri":"Azerbaijanis","surface_form":"Azerbaijanis","offset":1678},{"uri":"Census","surface_form":"census","offset":1737},{"uri":"Heraclius_II_of_Georgia","surface_form":"Heraclius II of Georgia","offset":1809},{"uri":"Petr_Ivanovich_Panin","surface_form":"Petr Ivanovich Panin","offset":1845}]}
