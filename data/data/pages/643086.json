He was a member of the Democratic Party. Pastore served as a United States Senator from Rhode Island from 1950 to 1976. He served as the 61st Governor of Rhode Island from 1945 to 1950. He was the first Italian American to be elected as a senator.\nPastore was best known taking part in a 1969 hearing involving a $20 million grant for the funding of PBS. President Richard Nixon had wanted to cut the proposed funding to $10 million due to the demands of the Vietnam War. Fred Rogers, host of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", appeared before the committee to argue for the full $20 million. After hearing Rogers's testimony Pastore restored the funding. The following year's appropriation increased PBS funding from $9 million to $22 million.\nPastore won his final Senate race in 1970 by a 68%\u201332% margin over John McLaughlin. McLaughlin later became the host of the television program \"The McLaughlin Group\".\nPastore died in Cranston, Rhode Island on July 15, 2000 of kidney failure at the age of 93.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":58},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":113},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":151},{"uri":"Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Rhode Island","offset":178},{"uri":"List_of_Governors_of_Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Governor","offset":232},{"uri":"Italian_American","surface_form":"Italian American","offset":293},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":440},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":455},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":549},{"uri":"Fred_Rogers","surface_form":"Fred Rogers","offset":562},{"uri":"Mister_Rogers%27_Neighborhood","surface_form":"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood","offset":584},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":787},{"uri":"John_McLaughlin_(host)","surface_form":"John McLaughlin","offset":898},{"uri":"The_McLaughlin_Group","surface_form":"The McLaughlin Group","offset":975},{"uri":"Cranston%2C_Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Cranston, Rhode Island","offset":1014},{"uri":"Kidney_failure","surface_form":"kidney failure","offset":1057}]}
