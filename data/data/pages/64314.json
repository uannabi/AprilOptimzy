{"id":64314,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system","text":"The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls the conditions inside the body. It is sometimes called the 'visceral nervous system' or 'involuntary nervous system'. The ANS is part of the peripheral nervous system.\nANS controls all automatic actions. That means that it controls all reflexes and actions during sleep.\nMost of its activities are done without the person having conscious control over them. The person usually cannot feel what the ANS is doing. However, some of the ANS's activities work together with the conscious mind, like breathing.\nThe ANS controls many different things, like heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, the discharge of urine, and erection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peripheral_nervous_system","surface_form":"peripheral nervous system","offset":185},{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"conscious","offset":373},{"uri":"Sensation","surface_form":"feel","offset":428},{"uri":"Heart_rate","surface_form":"heart rate","offset":594},{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"digestion","offset":606},{"uri":"Respiration","surface_form":"respiration","offset":617},{"uri":"Saliva","surface_form":"salivation","offset":635},{"uri":"Perspiration","surface_form":"perspiration","offset":647},{"uri":"Pupil_(eye)","surface_form":"pupils","offset":677},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":702},{"uri":"Erection","surface_form":"erection","offset":713}]}
