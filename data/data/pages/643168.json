{"id":643168,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_32","text":"Messier 32 (also known as NGC 221) is a dwarf \"early-type\" galaxy about 2.65 million light-years from Earth. It is seen in the constellation Andromeda.\nM32 is a satellite galaxy of the large Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. M32 measures 6.5 \u00B1 0.2 thousand light-years in diameter at the widest point.\nThe galaxy is a compact elliptical galaxy type. Compact ellipticals are rather rare.\nHalf the stars are inside an effective radius of only 100\u00A0parsecs.\nDensities in the central area increase steeply, over 3\u00D7107 M\u2299 pc\u22123 as seen by the HST. The half-light radius of this central star cluster is around 6 parsec. In other words, this small centre of the galaxy emits half the light of the central 100 parsecs.\nLike more ordinary elliptical galaxies, M32 contains mostly older faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current star formation. It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past.\nM32 contains a supermassive black hole.\nIts mass is between 1.5 and 5 million solar masses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light-year","offset":85},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":127},{"uri":"Andromeda_(constellation)","surface_form":"Andromeda","offset":141},{"uri":"Andromeda_Galaxy","surface_form":"Andromeda Galaxy","offset":191},{"uri":"Guillaume_Le_Gentil","surface_form":"Guillaume Le Gentil","offset":236},{"uri":"Elliptical_galaxy","surface_form":"elliptical galaxy","offset":366},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":466},{"uri":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"HST","offset":576},{"uri":"Elliptical_galaxies","surface_form":"elliptical galaxies","offset":768},{"uri":"Star_formation","surface_form":"star formation","offset":902},{"uri":"Supermassive_black_hole","surface_form":"supermassive black hole","offset":1011}]}
