{"id":64317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system","text":"e=\"preserve\">The peripheral nervous system, or PNS, is part of the nervous system. It consists of the nerves and ganglia which are outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). The main function of the PNS is to connect the central nervous system (CNS) to the limbs and organs.\nThe PNS is not protected by bone like the central nervous system. Therefore it is exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system (SNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). But the enteric nervous system (ENS) can be seen as a third branch of its own and not as part of the autonomic nervous system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":67},{"uri":"Nerves","surface_form":"nerves","offset":102},{"uri":"Ganglia","surface_form":"ganglia","offset":113},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":143},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":171},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":181},{"uri":"Function_(biology)","surface_form":"function","offset":204},{"uri":"Limb","surface_form":"limb","offset":278},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":288},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":324},{"uri":"Toxin","surface_form":"toxin","offset":389},{"uri":"Somatic_nervous_system","surface_form":"somatic nervous system","offset":471},{"uri":"Autonomic_nervous_system","surface_form":"autonomic nervous system","offset":508},{"uri":"Enteric_nervous_system","surface_form":"enteric nervous system","offset":548}]}
