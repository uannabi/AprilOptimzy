{"id":6432,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language","text":"Spanish (Spanish: \"espa\u00F1ol\", pronounced \"Eh-span-yole\", IPA: /espa\u0272ol/), also called Castilian, is a Romance language. It is the most spoken Romance language in the world. As of November 2015, over 360 million people in the world spoke Spanish as their first language.\nUsage.\nIn the United States and Belize, most people use English, but Spanish is the second-most common language.\nMany Brazilians learn Spanish as a second language even though Brazil's official language is Portuguese.\nRelated languages.\nThe Spanish language was originally the language of Castile. When the Western Roman Empire collapsed, Latin changed in different ways in different provinces. The Latin spoken in the Iberian Peninsula developed into the Ibero-Romance language in the 6th century. Castilian and Portuguese became separate languages around the 12th century.\nIn Spain, there are other languages that also came from Latin that are connected to Spanish, like Catalan, and Galician. Basque, also called Euskera or Euskara, is spoken in the Basque region of northern Spain and the southern region of France. Very different from Spanish, Basque is a language isolate since it is not known to have descended from any language family.\nCatalan is not a dialect of Spanish and is actually more closely related to French.\nName.\nSpanish is sometimes called Castilian because Castile is the region in Spain that is the origin of the language. Castile is the region that is considered to speak the most proper form of Spanish.\nThe Spanish word for Spanish is \"espa\u00F1ol\", and the Spanish word for Castilian is \"castellano\". In the other Romance languages spoken on the Iberian Peninsula, such as Galician, Catalan, Asturian, and others, Spanish is usually called \"Castell\u00E1n\" or \"Castell\u00E0\" instead of \"Spanish\". In Spain, the name of the subject in schools is \"lengua castellana\" (Castilian language). However, in the regions of Spain in which people speak only Spanish, people call their language Spanish.\nIn Portuguese, the word \"castelhano\" is common to mention Spanish, however, in informal language, the most preferred name for the language is \"espanhol\". Portuguese, which is spoken in Portugal and Brazil, has many similarities to Spanish.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"IPA","offset":56},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance language","offset":101},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":253},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":283},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":301},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":325},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":387},{"uri":"Second_language","surface_form":"second language","offset":417},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":475},{"uri":"Castile","surface_form":"Castile","offset":558},{"uri":"Western_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Western Roman Empire","offset":576},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":653},{"uri":"Iberian_peninsula","surface_form":"Iberian Peninsula","offset":688},{"uri":"6th_century","surface_form":"6th century","offset":755},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":830},{"uri":"Catalan_language","surface_form":"Catalan","offset":942},{"uri":"Galician_language","surface_form":"Galician","offset":955},{"uri":"Language_isolate","surface_form":"language isolate","offset":1130},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":1230},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1289},{"uri":"Castile","surface_form":"Castile","offset":1349},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":1364},{"uri":"Galician_language","surface_form":"Galician","offset":1666},{"uri":"Catalan_language","surface_form":"Catalan","offset":1676},{"uri":"Asturian_language","surface_form":"Asturian","offset":1685},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":1979},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":2130},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":2161},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":2174}]}
