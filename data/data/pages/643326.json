{"id":643326,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_Canada_Square","text":"Citigroup Centre is a building complex in London. It houses Citigroup's EMEA headquarters and is located in Canary Wharf in the city's Docklands. The centre provides of floor space across two merged buildings - 33 Canada Square (known as \"CGC1\") and 25 Canada Square (known as \"CGC2\"), and houses the bulk of Citi's UK employee base. Together, both buildings form the Citigroup Centre complex.\n25 Canada Square, or Citigroup Centre 2, stands at and, alongside HSBC Tower (with which it was built in tandem), is the joint 4th-tallest building in the United Kingdom (behind The Shard, One Canada Square and Heron Tower). Designed by C\u00E9sar Pelli & Associates, construction of the 45-storey tower - undertaken by Canary Wharf Contractors - began in 1998 and was completed in 2001, with Citigroup leasing the building from the outset. The building was bought by RBS in 2004 along with 5 Canada Square (leased to Bank of America) for $1.12 billion. Subsequently, on 2 July 2007, CGC2 was individually sold to a joint venture between Quinlan Private and PropInvest for \u00A31 billion (US$2 billion). Citigroup pay \u00A346.5 million a year in rent for the tower, generating a yield of 4.6% to the owners. The east facing side of 25 Canada Square up to level 40 is configured for use by tenants.\n33 Canada Square, or Citigroup Centre 1, is the smaller of the two buildings in the complex, designed by Norman Foster and completed in 1999, two years before its neighbour. At tall, the building is made up of eighteen floors, all of which are adjoined to their equivalent floors in 25 Canada Square. The building is owned by Citigroup, and was built before the completion of the Jubilee line extension in late 1999.\nIn addition to main entrances from both Canada Square and Upper Bank Street, Citigroup Centre is also accessible via underground walkways from Canada Place shopping mall and Canary Wharf London Underground station - served by the Jubilee line. The centre is also close to DLR stations Canary Wharf and Heron Quays, which provide connections with the City, London City Airport and surrounding areas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":42},{"uri":"Citigroup","surface_form":"Citigroup","offset":60},{"uri":"Europe%2C_the_Middle_East_and_Africa","surface_form":"EMEA","offset":72},{"uri":"Canary_Wharf","surface_form":"Canary Wharf","offset":108},{"uri":"London_Docklands","surface_form":"Docklands","offset":135},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":316},{"uri":"8_Canada_Square","surface_form":"HSBC Tower","offset":460},{"uri":"List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Great_Britain","surface_form":"4th-tallest building in the United Kingdom","offset":521},{"uri":"The_Shard","surface_form":"The Shard","offset":572},{"uri":"One_Canada_Square","surface_form":"One Canada Square","offset":583},{"uri":"Heron_Tower","surface_form":"Heron Tower","offset":605},{"uri":"C%C3%A9sar_Pelli","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar Pelli","offset":631},{"uri":"Royal_Bank_of_Scotland","surface_form":"RBS","offset":857},{"uri":"5_Canada_Square","surface_form":"5 Canada Square","offset":880},{"uri":"Bank_of_America","surface_form":"Bank of America","offset":907},{"uri":"Quinlan_Private","surface_form":"Quinlan Private","offset":1027},{"uri":"PropInvest","surface_form":"PropInvest","offset":1047},{"uri":"Norman_Foster%2C_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank","surface_form":"Norman Foster","offset":1384},{"uri":"Jubilee_line","surface_form":"Jubilee line","offset":1659},{"uri":"Canada_Square","surface_form":"Canada Square","offset":1736},{"uri":"Shopping_mall","surface_form":"shopping mall","offset":1852},{"uri":"Canary_Wharf_tube_station","surface_form":"Canary Wharf","offset":1870},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":1883},{"uri":"Docklands_Light_Railway","surface_form":"DLR","offset":1968},{"uri":"Canary_Wharf_DLR_station","surface_form":"Canary Wharf","offset":1981},{"uri":"Heron_Quays_DLR_station","surface_form":"Heron Quays","offset":1998},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City","offset":2046},{"uri":"London_City_Airport","surface_form":"London City Airport","offset":2052}]}
