{"id":643894,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocarpaceae","text":"Podocarpaceae is a large family of mainly Southern Hemisphere conifers. There are about 156 species of evergreen trees and shrubs. It has up to 19 genera. The distribution of this family suggests its early evolution took place in the ancient southern continent of Gondwana.\nThe family is a member of the Antarctic flora. Its main centres of diversity are in Australasia, particularly New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. They are also in Malesia and South America (mainly in the Andes mountains).\nSeveral genera extend north of the equator into Indochina and the Philippines. \"Podocarpus\" goes as far north as southern Japan and southern China in Asia, and Mexico in the Americas, and \"Nageia\" into southern China and southern India. Two genera also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, the widespread \"Podocarpus\" and the endemic \"Afrocarpus\".\n\"Parasitaxus usta\" is unique as the only known parasitic gymnosperm. It occurs on New Caledonia, where it is parasitic on another member of the Podocarpaceae, \"Falcatifolium taxoides\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":25},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":42},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"conifer","offset":62},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":92},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":103},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":113},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":123},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":147},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":264},{"uri":"Antarctic","surface_form":"Antarctic","offset":304},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":314},{"uri":"Biodiversity","surface_form":"diversity","offset":341},{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":358},{"uri":"New_Caledonia","surface_form":"New Caledonia","offset":384},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":399},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":413},{"uri":"Malesia","surface_form":"Malesia","offset":443},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":455},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":484},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":537},{"uri":"Indochina","surface_form":"Indochina","offset":550},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":568},{"uri":"Podocarpus","surface_form":"Podocarpus","offset":582},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":624},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":643},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":662},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":713},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":732},{"uri":"Afrotropic","surface_form":"sub-Saharan","offset":764},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":776},{"uri":"Afrocarpus","surface_form":"Afrocarpus","offset":829},{"uri":"Parasitaxus_usta","surface_form":"Parasitaxus usta","offset":843},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":889},{"uri":"Gymnosperm","surface_form":"gymnosperm","offset":899},{"uri":"New_Caledonia","surface_form":"New Caledonia","offset":924},{"uri":"Falcatifolium_taxoides","surface_form":"Falcatifolium taxoides","offset":1002}]}
