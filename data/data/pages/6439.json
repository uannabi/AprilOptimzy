Czechia's population is about 10.5 million.\nThe local language is the Czech language, a Slavic language related to languages like Slovak and Polish.\nCzechia has no sea; its neighbour countries are Germany, Austria, Slovakia, and Poland.\nHistory.\nIts history dates from the 9th century AD, for a long time it was one of the most powerful countries in Central Europe. Later on it was the biggest, most populated and richest country of the First Reich, where many Emperors started their career. Under the conditions of the Treaty of Vienna 1515 parts of Czechia, then in the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, came under Habsburg rule after the death of Louis the Jagiellon in 1526. They stayed a part of the Habsburg dynasty rule until 1918.\nThe area of the today's Czechia was a part of Czechoslovakia (current area of Czechia and Slovak republic) from 1918 to 1992. Czechoslovakia became independent in 1918 from Austro-Hungarian Empire. The first Czechoslovakian president was Tom\u00E1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk. In February 1948 the Communist party took over the country and for the next 41 years Czechoslovakia was a Socialist state with a rule of one (Communist) party. In 1968 there was a reformation movement (Prague Spring) within the Communist party, but reforms were stopped by the invasion of Warsaw pact armies. In November 1989 Czechoslovakia returned to democracy through the peaceful \"Velvet Revolution\".\u00A0 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries (Czechia and Slovakia) in 1993.\nCzechia has been a member of the European Union since May 1 2004, and a member of NATO since March 12, 1999.\nGeography.\nThe highest point in the country is Sn\u011B\u017Eka at.\nThere are four national parks in Czechia.

The others are \u0160umava National Park, Podyj\u00ED National Park, Bohemian Switzerland.\nRegions.\nIn 1949 the communist government created 13 centralized regions instead of historical countries. In 1960 the regions changed leaving only 8 regions. In 2000 14 regions were formed with their own regional self-government.\nReligion.\nCzechia has one of the least religious populations in the world. According to the 2011 census, 34.2% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% were Roman Catholic, 0.8% were Protestant (0.5% Czech Brethren and 0.4% Hussite), and 9.4% followed other forms of religion both denominational or not (of which 863 people answered they are Pagan). 45.2% of the population did not answer the question about religion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":28},{"uri":"Central_Europe","surface_form":"Central Europe","offset":39},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":130},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":154},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":162},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":174},{"uri":"Crown","surface_form":"Crown","offset":196},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":250},{"uri":"Milo%C5%A1_Zeman","surface_form":"Milo\u0161 Zeman","offset":274},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":297},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":341},{"uri":"Czech_language","surface_form":"Czech language","offset":357},{"uri":"Slavic_language","surface_form":"Slavic language","offset":375},{"uri":"Slovak_language","surface_form":"Slovak","offset":417},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":428},{"uri":"Landlocked","surface_form":"has no sea","offset":444},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":484},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":493},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":502},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":516},{"uri":"First_Reich","surface_form":"First Reich","offset":724},{"uri":"Bohemia","surface_form":"Bohemia","offset":871},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":883},{"uri":"Habsburg_Monarchy","surface_form":"Habsburg","offset":903},{"uri":"Jagiellonian_dynasty","surface_form":"Louis the Jagiellon","offset":936},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia","offset":1071},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovak republic","offset":1115},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":1173},{"uri":"Austro-Hungarian_Empire","surface_form":"Austro-Hungarian Empire","offset":1198},{"uri":"Tomas_Garrigue_Masaryk","surface_form":"Tom\u00E1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk","offset":1263},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"Communist","offset":1308},{"uri":"Socialist","surface_form":"Socialist","offset":1393},{"uri":"Prague_Spring","surface_form":"Prague Spring","offset":1489},{"uri":"Warsaw_Pact","surface_form":"Warsaw pact","offset":1576},{"uri":"Velvet_Revolution","surface_form":"Velvet Revolution","offset":1672},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":1809},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":1858},{"uri":"Sn%C4%9B%C5%BEka","surface_form":"Sn\u011B\u017Eka","offset":1932},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":1958},{"uri":"Krkono%C5%A1e_National_Park","surface_form":"Krkono\u0161e National Park","offset":1999},{"uri":"%C5%A0umava_National_Park","surface_form":"\u0160umava National Park","offset":2038},{"uri":"Podyj%C3%AD_National_Park","surface_form":"Podyj\u00ED National Park","offset":2060},{"uri":"Bohemian_Switzerland","surface_form":"Bohemian Switzerland","offset":2082},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":2503},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":2529},{"uri":"Evangelical_Church_of_Czech_Brethren","surface_form":"Czech Brethren","offset":2546},{"uri":"Hussite_Church","surface_form":"Hussite","offset":2570},{"uri":"Neopaganism","surface_form":"Pagan","offset":2688}]}
