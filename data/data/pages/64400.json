{"id":64400,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag","text":"A gag is any thing used to stop a person from speaking. This is done by blocking or muffling the person's mouth and making it difficult for them to move their jaw and tongue in a normal way.\nGags are very commonly seen in BDSM and bondage fantasy. Many different items can be used, ranging from a hand simply clamped over the victim's mouth, to a scarf tied between the jaws, to adhesive tape placed over the mouth and face to seal the lips. There are also many kinds of specially-made gags, which usually strap around or behind the head. Special gags of that kind are usually made from leather or rubber.\nIn real life it is quite difficult to gag a person in such a way that their speech cannot be understood at all, and it is almost impossible to prevent a gagged person from making some kind of sound. It is also a risk to the person's safety, as the more tightly and securely someone is gagged, the greater the risk that they will choke or suffocate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"BDSM","surface_form":"BDSM","offset":222},{"uri":"Bondage","surface_form":"bondage","offset":231},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":587},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":598}]}
