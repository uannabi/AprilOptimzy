In 2016 Unity changed from one time purchase into a subscription model. There currently exist one free and three paid licensing options: Personal (Free), Plus, Pro, Enterprise.\nUnity has a robust collection of official tutorials to help familiarize new developers with the engine. Additionally, it has thorough documentation that they update to be accurate with each new Unity release. The tutorials and documentation make use of pre-built assets that are available in the default Unity program.
