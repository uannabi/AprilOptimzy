{"id":64459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald","text":"An emerald is a mineral gemstone and a variety of beryl. It is the birthstone of someone whose birthday is in the month of May. It is a green crystal. The emerald is one of the most valuable gems, along with the ruby, the opal, topaz, the diamond, and a sapphire.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"emerald\" comes from Vulgar Latin. The word was Esmaralda/Esmaraldus, a different way of saying the Latin word \"Smaragdus\", which came from the Greek, (\"smaragdos\"; \"green gem\"). It first came from a Semitic word, \"izmargad\" (). This meant \"emerald\" or \"green\". The name could also be related to the Semitic word baraq (\u05D1\u05B8\u05BC\u05E8\u05B8\u05E7;\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064F\u0631\u0627\u0642; \"lightning\" or \"shine\") (c.f. \"bareqeth\" and, \"barq\", \"lightning\"). It is where the Persian (\"zomorrod\"), Turkish (), Sanskrit (\"maragdam\") and Russian (; \"izumr\u00FAd\") words came from.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":16},{"uri":"Gemstone","surface_form":"gemstone","offset":24},{"uri":"Beryl","surface_form":"beryl","offset":50},{"uri":"May","surface_form":"May","offset":123},{"uri":"Green","surface_form":"green","offset":136},{"uri":"Gem","surface_form":"gem","offset":191},{"uri":"Ruby","surface_form":"ruby","offset":212},{"uri":"Opal","surface_form":"opal","offset":222},{"uri":"Topaz","surface_form":"topaz","offset":228},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":239},{"uri":"Sapphire","surface_form":"sapphire","offset":254},{"uri":"Vulgar_Latin","surface_form":"Vulgar Latin","offset":305},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":428},{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic","offset":484},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":704},{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":726},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":764}]}
