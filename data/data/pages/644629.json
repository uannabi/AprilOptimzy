After graduating from Seishi Elementary School, and then from Azabu High School, he enrolled in Science Division-I of the University of Tokyo, in 1976. Among those in his class in the Division was Makoto Gonokami (physicist and current president of the University of Tokyo). Matsuyama later switched to International Relations. Among those in his class there were Toyohisa Kozuki (current ambassador to Russia), Jun Yamazaki (current ambassador to Singapore, former ambassador to the United Nations and Sweden) and former LDP Diet member Seiji Hagiwara. It was through his studies in international relations that he came across economics for the first time. Although he passed the advanced-level civil service examination of the Japanese government in his senior year, he chose to continue his studies in economics.\nAfter receiving his BA in International Relations in 1980, he enrolled in the doctoral program at the University of Tokyo\u2019s Graduate School of Economics, where he studied with Ry\u016Btar\u014D Komiya, K\u014Dichi Hamada, Takashi Negishi, and Tsuneo Ishikawa, as well as, briefly, with Motoshige It\u014D,[4] Katsuhito Iwai, and Kiyohiko Nishimura.\nFrom October 1982, he also worked as a research assistant for economist Masahiro Okuno, who was then a visiting fellow at the Bank of Japan\u2019s Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies.[5]\nMatsuyama enrolled in Harvard University\u2019s doctorate program in September 1983, where he studied under Jeffrey Sachs, Lawrence Summers, and Greg Mankiw. Classmates included Philippe Aghion, Abhijit Banerjee (2019 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences), Mathias Dewatripont, Miles Kimball, and Alan Krueger. He received a PhD in economics from Harvard in 1987.\nCareer.\nMatsuyama became an assistant professor of economics at Northwestern University in September 1987, associate professor in September 1991, and professor in September 1995. He spent 1991 at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University as a National Fellow. He received the Nakahara Prize from the Japanese Economic Association in 1996 and became a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 1999. In addition to teaching at the University of Chicago as a visiting professor in 1993 and at MIT in 2008,[6] he has visited many universities and research institutes around the world and has been invited to deliver plenary lectures and keynote speeches at various international conferences.\nIn 2014, he became an international senior fellow of the Canon Institute for Global Studies,[7] and in December 2018 he was appointed chief scientific adviser of the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research\nResearch.\nMatsuyama\u2019s main fields of research are international trade and macroeconomics.[8] His thesis for a BA in international relations at the University of Tokyo was on foreign direct investment and multinational corporations. He wrote his doctoral dissertation at Harvard University on the intertemporal approach to the current account and the game-theoretic analysis of the political economy of international monetary policy coordination and of trade and industrial policies. After joining the Northwestern faculty, he has worked extensively on such topics as international trade, economic growth, economic development, income inequality, structural change, and endogenous economic fluctuations. He is, in his own words, \u201Cinterested in understanding the mechanisms behind macroeconomic instability, structural transformation, as well as inequality across countries, regions, and households, and how they interact with credit market imperfections and product market innovations.\u201D[9]\nReferences.\n[1] Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research, https://www.tkfd.or.jp/en/experts/detail.php?id=303\n[2] Canon Institute for Global Studies, https://www.canon-igs.org/en/fellows/kiminori_matsuyama.html\n[3] Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory, https://saet.uiowa.edu/economic-theory-fellows/\n[4] \u201CSpecial New Year\u2019s Colloquy: Priority Issues for Public Policy Research (Part I),\u201D https://www.tkfd.or.jp/en/research/detail.php?id=668\n[5] Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies(IMES), https://www.imes.boj.or.jp/english/index.html\n[7] https://www.canon-igs.org/en/fellows/kiminori_matsuyama.html\n[8] https://www.canon-igs.org/en/fellows/kiminori_matsuyama.html\n[9] https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/en-economics-innovation-lab/Clement-Malgouyres__1.htm","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Economist","surface_form":"economist","offset":14},{"uri":"Northwestern_University","surface_form":"Northwestern University","offset":59},{"uri":"Tokyo_Foundation","surface_form":"the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research","offset":141},{"uri":"Nakahara_Prize","surface_form":"Nakahara Prize","offset":292},{"uri":"Japanese_Economic_Association","surface_form":"Japanese Economic Association","offset":316},{"uri":"Econometric_Society","surface_form":"Econometric Society","offset":386},{"uri":"Bunky%C5%8D%2C_Tokyo","surface_form":"Bunky\u014D","offset":568},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":579},{"uri":"Azabu_High_School","surface_form":"Azabu High School","offset":648},{"uri":"University_of_Tokyo","surface_form":"University of Tokyo","offset":708},{"uri":"Ambassador","surface_form":"ambassador","offset":975},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":989},{"uri":"Jun_Yamazaki","surface_form":"Jun Yamazaki","offset":998},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":1034},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1070},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":1089},{"uri":"Seiji_Hagiwara","surface_form":"Seiji Hagiwara","offset":1124},{"uri":"Civil_service_of_Japan","surface_form":"civil service examination","offset":1282},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Arts","surface_form":"BA","offset":1422},{"uri":"Doctorate","surface_form":"doctoral","offset":1480},{"uri":"Koichi_Hamada","surface_form":"K\u014Dichi Hamada","offset":1594},{"uri":"Takashi_Negishi","surface_form":"Takashi Negishi","offset":1609},{"uri":"Katsuhito_Iwai","surface_form":"Katsuhito Iwai","offset":1691},{"uri":"Visiting_scholar","surface_form":"visiting fellow","offset":1834},{"uri":"Bank_of_Japan","surface_form":"Bank of Japan","offset":1857},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University\u2019s","offset":1943},{"uri":"Jeffrey_Sachs","surface_form":"Jeffrey Sachs","offset":2024},{"uri":"Lawrence_Summers","surface_form":"Lawrence Summers","offset":2039},{"uri":"Greg_Mankiw","surface_form":"Greg Mankiw","offset":2061},{"uri":"Philippe_Aghion","surface_form":"Philippe Aghion","offset":2094},{"uri":"Abhijit_Banerjee","surface_form":"Abhijit Banerjee","offset":2111},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences","offset":2151},{"uri":"Mathias_Dewatripont","surface_form":"Mathias Dewatripont","offset":2186},{"uri":"Miles_Kimball","surface_form":"Miles Kimball","offset":2207},{"uri":"Alan_Krueger","surface_form":"Alan Krueger","offset":2226},{"uri":"Hoover_Institution","surface_form":"Hoover Institution","offset":2493},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford University","offset":2515},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":2722},{"uri":"Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","surface_form":"MIT","offset":2783},{"uri":"Tokyo_Foundation","surface_form":"Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research","offset":3147},{"uri":"International_trade","surface_form":"international trade","offset":3234},{"uri":"Macroeconomics","surface_form":"macroeconomics","offset":3258},{"uri":"International_relations","surface_form":"international relations","offset":3300},{"uri":"Foreign_direct_investment","surface_form":"foreign direct investment","offset":3358},{"uri":"Multinational_corporation","surface_form":"multinational corporation","offset":3388},{"uri":"Economic_growth","surface_form":"economic growth","offset":3772},{"uri":"Economic_development","surface_form":"economic development","offset":3789},{"uri":"Economic_inequality","surface_form":"income inequality","offset":3811},{"uri":"Structural_change","surface_form":"structural change","offset":3830},{"uri":"Goodwin_model_(economics)","surface_form":"endogenous economic fluctuations","offset":3853}]}
