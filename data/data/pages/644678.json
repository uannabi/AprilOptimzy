They are clean dogs which makes them more cat-like than other dogs and they will spend hours cleaning themselves when they have any dirt on their coats. Just like cats, Basenjis use their paws to clean themselves and as a result rarely have any sort of smell about them.\nBasenjis are around the size of a terrier and have a very endearing (inspiring) look about them which is enhanced (helped) by the wrinkles on their foreheads. They are wonderfully friendly by nature as well as being inquisitive (curious) and confident. A Basenji forms a very strong and close bond with a family and in particular with one person in a household which is why over the years, they have become one of the most popular choices of a family pets or companion dogs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animals.","offset":171},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cats","offset":603},{"uri":"Terrier","surface_form":"terrier","offset":745},{"uri":"Bond","surface_form":"bond","offset":1004}]}
