It occupies more than a quarter of the German federal state (\"Bundesland\") of Rhineland-Palatinate (\"Rheinland-Pfalz\").\nGeography.\nThe western and northern part of the Palatinate is densely forested and mountainous. The highest point is the Donnersberg () near Kirchheimbolanden. The Palatinate forest (\"Pf\u00E4lzerwald\") covers more than a third of the region and is the largest uninterrupted forest in Germany. The eastern part is lower, and is a well known wine region, the Palatinate wine region through which passes the \"German wine road\" (Deutsche Weinstrasse). Most of the cities of the Palatinate (Ludwigshafen, Speyer, Landau, Frankenthal, Neustadt) lie in the Rhineplain in the east.\nTraditionally, the Palatinate is divided into the regions of Anterior Palatinate (\"Vorderpfalz\"), West Palatinate (\"Westpfalz\"), North Palatinate (\"Nordpfalz\"), and South Palatinate (\"S\u00FCdpfalz\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":151},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"federal state","offset":206},{"uri":"Rhineland-Palatinate","surface_form":"Rhineland-Palatinate","offset":238},{"uri":"Donnersberg","surface_form":"Donnersberg","offset":401},{"uri":"Kirchheimbolanden","surface_form":"Kirchheimbolanden","offset":421},{"uri":"Palatinate_forest","surface_form":"Palatinate forest","offset":444},{"uri":"Palatinate_(wine_region)","surface_form":"Palatinate wine region","offset":633},{"uri":"German_wine_road","surface_form":"German wine road","offset":682}]}
