{"id":64482,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taunus","text":"The Taunus is a mountain range in Hesse, Germany. It is bounded by the river valleys of Rhine, Main and Lahn. On the opposite side of the Rhine, the mountains are continued by the Hunsr\u00FCck. The mountains themselves span the districts of Hochtaunuskreis, Main-Taunus, Rheingau-Taunus, and Rhein-Lahn.\nNot to be confused with the more famous and high Feldberg in Black Forest, the highest peak is the \"Gro\u00DFer Feldberg\" (878 m above sea level). It is followed by the \"Kleiner Feldberg\" and the \"Altk\u00F6nig\" (798 m) with the remains of a late Iron Age hill fort (La-T\u00E8ne A, ca. 400 BC) near the summit.\nThe Roman Limes was built across the Taunus. The Saalburg, a restored Roman castellum, now houses a museum. After the fall of the Limes (in 259/260 AD), the Alamanni settled here.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hesse","offset":34},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":41},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":88},{"uri":"Main","surface_form":"Main","offset":95},{"uri":"Lahn","surface_form":"Lahn","offset":104},{"uri":"Hunsr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Hunsr\u00FCck","offset":180},{"uri":"Hochtaunuskreis","surface_form":"Hochtaunuskreis","offset":237},{"uri":"Main-Taunus","surface_form":"Main-Taunus","offset":254},{"uri":"Rheingau-Taunus","surface_form":"Rheingau-Taunus","offset":267},{"uri":"Rhein-Lahn","surface_form":"Rhein-Lahn","offset":288},{"uri":"Feldberg","surface_form":"Feldberg","offset":349},{"uri":"Black_Forest","surface_form":"Black Forest","offset":361},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"m","offset":422},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":430},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":537},{"uri":"Hill_fort","surface_form":"hill fort","offset":546},{"uri":"400_BC","surface_form":"400 BC","offset":572},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":601},{"uri":"Limes","surface_form":"Limes","offset":607},{"uri":"Saalburg","surface_form":"Saalburg","offset":646},{"uri":"259","surface_form":"259","offset":737},{"uri":"260","surface_form":"260","offset":741},{"uri":"Alamanni","surface_form":"Alamanni","offset":754}]}
