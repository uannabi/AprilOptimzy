{"id":644991,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_South_Korea","text":"The Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea (\uAD6D\uBB34\uCD1D\uB9AC / \u570B\u52D9\u7E3D\u7406, \"Gungmuchongni\") is appointed by the President of South Korea, with the National Assembly's approval. The officeholder is not required to be a member of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister is not the head of government but is similar to that of a vice president.\nThe Sino-Korean word \"gungmu\" (/) means \"state affairs\" and \"chongni\" (/) means \"prime minister\", \"premier\" or \"chancellor\", so the full title in Korean means literally \"Prime Minister for State Affairs\", but it is not used as official English title. The short title in Korean is just \"Chongni\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_South_Korea","surface_form":"President of South Korea","offset":95},{"uri":"National_Assembly_(South_Korea)","surface_form":"National Assembly","offset":130},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":264},{"uri":"Vice_presiden","surface_form":"vice presiden","offset":311},{"uri":"Sino-Korean_vocabulary","surface_form":"Sino-Korean","offset":331},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":408},{"uri":"Premier","surface_form":"premier","offset":426},{"uri":"Chancellor","surface_form":"chancellor","offset":439}]}
