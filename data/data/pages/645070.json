{"id":645070,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor%E2%80%93generator","text":"A motor\u2013generator is a device for converting electrical power to another form. Motor\u2013generator sets are used to convert frequency, voltage, or phase of power. They may also be used to isolate electrical loads from the electrical power supply line. Large motor\u2013generators were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller motor\u2013generators were used to convert battery power to higher voltages.\nNowadays, motor\u2013generators have largely been replaced by semiconductor devices. Examples include rectifiers for converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and inverters for converting DC to AC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electrical power","offset":45},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":120},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":131},{"uri":"Three-phase_electric_power","surface_form":"phase","offset":143},{"uri":"Battery_(electricity)","surface_form":"battery","offset":379},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":470},{"uri":"Rectifier","surface_form":"rectifier","offset":510},{"uri":"Alternating_current","surface_form":"alternating current","offset":536},{"uri":"Direct_current","surface_form":"direct current","offset":564},{"uri":"Inverter","surface_form":"inverter","offset":588}]}
