It, along with Vega, and Altair make up the Summer Triangle asterism.\nIt has an apparent magnitude of 1.25, which means that it is the 20th brightest star in the night sky. However its distance from the sun and luminosity are difficult to calculate, but it's distance is estimated to be approximately 2,600 light years away. It is thought to be between 55,000 and 196,000 times as luminous as the Sun.\nDeneb is a blue supergiant that is 203 times larger than the Sun.\nDeneb will be the Pole Star in the year 9800 AD.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":72},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":84},{"uri":"Cygnus","surface_form":"Cygnus","offset":101},{"uri":"Vega","surface_form":"Vega","offset":124},{"uri":"Altair","surface_form":"Altair","offset":134},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent magnitude","offset":189},{"uri":"List_of_brightest_stars","surface_form":"20th brightest star","offset":244},{"uri":"Luminosity","surface_form":"luminosity","offset":320},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light years","offset":416},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":506},{"uri":"Pole_Star","surface_form":"Pole Star","offset":595}]}
