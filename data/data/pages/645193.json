He had eight aerial victories, and led No.\u00A075 Squadron during the Battle of Port Moresby in 1942. Born in Brisbane, he was a grazier and businessman. He had his own private plane when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Reserve in 1936. In 1939, at the start of the war, he was called up for active service. Jackson served with No.\u00A023 Squadron in Australia before he was posted to the Middle East in November 1940. As a fighter pilot with No.\u00A03 Squadron he flew Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and P-40 Tomahawks during the North African and Syria\u2013Lebanon campaigns.\nJackson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Mentioned in Despatches for his actions in the Middle East. In March 1942, while serving in the\u00A0South West Pacific theatre, he was promoted to squadron leader. He was in\u00A0command of No.\u00A075 Squadron at Port Moresby in Papua, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. Described as \"rugged, simple\" and \"true as steel\", Jackson, aged 34, was nicknamed \"Old John\" by his much younger squadron members.\u00A0He was praised for his leadership during the defence of Port Moresby. He was killed in action on 28\u00A0April 1942. His younger brother Les took over No.\u00A075 Squadron, and also became a fighter ace.
