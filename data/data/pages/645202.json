It is powered by liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket grade kerosene (RP-1). The current version can launch payloads of up to to Low Earth orbit. It can launch up to to Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). In theory, it can also launch to Mars.\nNASA gave SpaceX a Commercial Resupply Services contract to launch Falcon 9s with Dragon capsules to the ISS. Now SpaceX is trying to human-rate the Falcon 9 so that SpaceX can launch crews to the ISS in this year. The first version of the Falcon 9 flew in 4 June 2010. The latest version, Block 5, was introduced in 15 May 2018 with increased engine power and other changes to help recovery and reuse.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["rocket/payload","rocket/payload","rocket/payload","rocket/stage","rocket/stage"],"annotations":[{"uri":"SpaceX","surface_form":"SpaceX","offset":58},{"uri":"Liquid_oxygen","surface_form":"liquid oxygen","offset":131},{"uri":"RP-1","surface_form":"RP-1","offset":178},{"uri":"Low_Earth_orbit","surface_form":"Low Earth orbit","offset":237},{"uri":"Geostationary_transfer_orbit","surface_form":"Geostationary transfer orbit","offset":277},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":346},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":352},{"uri":"ISS","surface_form":"ISS","offset":457},{"uri":"Human-rating_certification","surface_form":"human-rate","offset":486}]}
