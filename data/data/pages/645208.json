It was also given to members of\u00A0other Commonwealth countries. The medal was awarded for \"an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy\".\nHistory.\nThe award was established on 3 June 1918, shortly after the formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was originally awarded to RAF officers. During the Second World War, it was also awarded to Royal Artillery officers serving with the RAF as pilots and\u00A0artillery observers. In 1993 the medal replaced the Distinguished Flying Medal, which had until then been awarded to other ranks.\u00A0People awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross are allowed to use the post-nominal letters \"DFC\". A bar is added to the ribbon for holders of the DFC who received a second award.\nDuring the First World War, about 1,100 DFCs were awarded, with 70 first bars and 3 second bars. During the Second World War, 20,354 DFCs were awarded, the most of any award, with about 1,550 first bars and 45 second bars.\nHonorary awards were made on 964 occasions to people from other non-Commonwealth countries.\nDescription.\nThe decoration is a cross flory and is 2\u215B inches wide. The horizontal and bottom bars have bumps at the end, while the upper bar has a rose. The front of the medal has aeroplane propellers, placed on the vertical arms of the cross, and wings on the horizontal arms. In the centre is a laurel wreath around the RAF monogram, with a heraldic Imperial Crown\u00A0on the top.\nThe back of the medal has the Royal Cypher in the centre and the year of issue engraved on the lower arm. The decoration is issued named.\nThe ribbon was originally white with purple broad horizontal stripes. This was changed in 1919 to the current white with purple broad diagonal stripes.\nThe decoration was designed by Edward Carter Preston.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_Air_Force","surface_form":"Royal Air Force","offset":125},{"uri":"British_Armed_Forces","surface_form":"services","offset":151},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":199},{"uri":"Courage","surface_form":"courage","offset":276},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":522},{"uri":"Royal_Artillery","surface_form":"Royal Artillery","offset":563},{"uri":"Artillery_observer","surface_form":"artillery observer","offset":623},{"uri":"Distinguished_Flying_Medal","surface_form":"Distinguished Flying Medal","offset":675},{"uri":"Other_ranks_(UK)","surface_form":"other ranks","offset":740},{"uri":"Post-nominal_letters","surface_form":"post-nominal letters","offset":822},{"uri":"Medal_bar","surface_form":"bar","offset":852},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"First World War","offset":942},{"uri":"Cross_fleury","surface_form":"cross flory","offset":1279},{"uri":"Bay_laurel","surface_form":"laurel","offset":1544},{"uri":"Tudor_Crown_(heraldry)","surface_form":"Imperial Crown","offset":1599},{"uri":"Royal_Cypher","surface_form":"Royal Cypher","offset":1656},{"uri":"Edward_Carter_Preston","surface_form":"Edward Carter Preston","offset":1947}]}
