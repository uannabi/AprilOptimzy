{"id":645281,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege","text":"The Waco siege was the siege of a compound belonging to the Branch Davidians, carried out by American federal and Texas state law enforcement, as well as the U.S. military, between February 28 and April 19, 1993.\nThe Branch Davidians were led by David Koresh and were headquartered at Mount Carmel Center ranch in the community of Axtell, Texas, 13 miles (21 kilometers) east-northeast of Waco.\nThe incident began when the ATF attempted to raid the ranch. An intense gun battle erupted, resulting in the deaths of four government agents and six Branch Davidians. Upon the ATF's failure to raid the compound, a siege lasting 51 days was initiated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nEventually, the FBI launched an assault and initiated a tear gas attack in an attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the ranch. During the attack, a fire engulfed Mount Carmel Center. In total, 76 people died, including David Koresh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Siege","surface_form":"siege","offset":23},{"uri":"Branch_Davidians","surface_form":"Branch Davidians","offset":60},{"uri":"United_States_Federal_Government","surface_form":"federal","offset":102},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":114},{"uri":"United_States_Armed_Forces","surface_form":"U.S. military","offset":158},{"uri":"David_Koresh","surface_form":"David Koresh","offset":246},{"uri":"Mount_Carmel_Center","surface_form":"Mount Carmel Center","offset":285},{"uri":"Waco%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Waco","offset":389},{"uri":"Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","surface_form":"Federal Bureau of Investigation","offset":653},{"uri":"Tear_gas","surface_form":"tear gas","offset":748}]}
