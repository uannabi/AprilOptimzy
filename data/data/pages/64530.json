Along with silicate, it includes the chemical elements aluminium and fluorine with the chemical formula Al2SiO4(F,OH)2.\nColor and varieties.\nPure topaz is colorless and transparent but they usually have colors made by small impurities. The typical topaz is wine, yellow, pale gray, reddish-orange, or blue brown. It can also be made white, pale green, blue, gold, or pink (rare).\n\"Orange topaz\", also known as precious topaz, is the traditional November birthstone, the symbol of friendship, and the state gemstone for the US state of Utah.\n\"Imperial topaz\" is yellow, pink (rare, if natural) or pink-orange.
