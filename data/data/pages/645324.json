{"id":645324,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain","text":"In most cases, a blockchain is managed by a peer-to-peer network. All peers use a common protocol that specifies how they should communicate with each other, how a new block is created and validated. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed easily any more. Changing the block means all the blocks after it need to be changed as well. Depending on the protocol, this will require a majority of the peers, or even all the peers, to agree.\nBlockchains are secure by design. Blockchain technology is used where keeping a correct record is important. Use cases include medical records, identity management, food traceability, and voting.\nBlockchain was invented by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in 1991 as a means to assure the integrity of digital records. Haber and Stornetta launched the world's first commercial blockchain; [http://www.surety.com/ Surety] in 1995.\nIn 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto included as references 3 and 4 of [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System], the two papers by Haber and Stornetta to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Because of its blockchain, bitcoin became the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peer-to-peer","surface_form":"peer-to-peer","offset":44},{"uri":"Communication_protocol","surface_form":"protocol","offset":89},{"uri":"Voting","surface_form":"voting","offset":646},{"uri":"Ledger","surface_form":"ledger","offset":1103},{"uri":"Cryptocurrency","surface_form":"cryptocurrency","offset":1117},{"uri":"Bitcoin","surface_form":"bitcoin","offset":1132},{"uri":"Bitcoin","surface_form":"bitcoin","offset":1168},{"uri":"Server_(computing)","surface_form":"server","offset":1298}]}
