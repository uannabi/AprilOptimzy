{"id":645347,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_strategy","text":"=\"preserve\">The Fabian strategy is a military strategy where one side avoids the other, and avoids pitched battles and frontal assaults.\nThe object is to wear down the opponent by a \"war of attrition\". The side using this strategy harasses its enemy through skirmishes to weaken it, disrupt supply and affect morale.\nThis strategy is employed by a side which believes \"time is on its side\", but it may also be adopted when no other strategy is possible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military_strategy","surface_form":"military strategy","offset":37},{"uri":"Pitched_battle","surface_form":"pitched battle","offset":99},{"uri":"Frontal_assault","surface_form":"frontal assault","offset":119},{"uri":"Attrition_warfare","surface_form":"war of attrition","offset":183},{"uri":"Skirmish","surface_form":"skirmish","offset":258},{"uri":"Logistics","surface_form":"supply","offset":291}]}
