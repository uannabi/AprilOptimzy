It may be expressed as a percentage or in other ways. For example, a gradient of 1% may also be expressed as 1 in 100. This means that the road rises or falls by 1 metre for every 100 metres of forward travel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gradient_(disambiguation)","surface_form":"Gradient (disambiguation)","offset":35},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":90},{"uri":"Railway_track","surface_form":"railway line","offset":98}]}
