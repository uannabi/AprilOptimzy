In the late 19th century the LNWR was the largest joint stock company in the world. The LNWR was formed in 1846 by a merger of the Grand Junction Railway, the London & Birmingham Railway and the Manchester & Birmingham Railway. The London terminus was at Euston railway station\nIn 1923, the LNWR became a part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) under the Railways Act 1921.
