{"id":645439,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Railway","text":"=\"preserve\">The Midland Railway (MR) was a railway company in the United Kingdom from 1844 to 1922. It had a large network of lines managed from its headquarters in Derby. It became the third-largest railway undertaking in the British Isles after the Great Western Railway and the London and North Western Railway.\nThe company was formed in 1844 by the merger of the Midland Counties Railway, the North Midland Railway, and the Birmingham & Derby Junction Railway. The Birmingham & Gloucester Railway joined two years later. The earlier systems met at Derby railway station. The MR established its locomotive works, and later its carriage and wagon works, at Derby.\nIn 1923, the MR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway under the Railways Act 1921.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":43},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":66},{"uri":"Derby","surface_form":"Derby","offset":165},{"uri":"Great_Western_Railway","surface_form":"Great Western Railway","offset":251},{"uri":"London_and_North_Western_Railway","surface_form":"London and North Western Railway","offset":281},{"uri":"Derby_railway_station","surface_form":"Derby railway station","offset":552},{"uri":"London%2C_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway","surface_form":"London, Midland and Scottish Railway","offset":701},{"uri":"Railways_Act_1921","surface_form":"Railways Act 1921","offset":748}]}
