{"id":64546,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain","text":"Lake Champlain is a natural freshwater lake in North America along the borders of New York and Vermont and partially across the United States-Canada border in the province of Quebec. The lake was named for the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who came there in 1609.\nA region of large freshwater lakes.\nLake Champlain is one of a large number of large lakes spread in an arc from Labrador through the northern United States and into the Northwest Territories of Canada. Although it is much smaller than the Great Lakes of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Superior, or Michigan, Lake Champlain is a large body of fresh water. The lake is about in area. It is about long. At its widest point, it is about wide. The maximum depth is about. It contains about 80 islands, including an the entire country of Grand Isle County in Vermont.\nColonial America and the Revolutionary War.\nIn the colonial times, Lake Champlain gave an easily blocked water (or, in winter, ice) passage between the Saint Lawrence and the Hudson Valleys. Boats and sledges were usually preferable to the unpaved and frequently mud-bound roads of the time. The northern tip of the lake at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (St. John in colonial times) is a short distance from Montreal. The southern tip at Whitehall (Skenesborough in colonial times) is a short distance from Saratoga, Glens Falls, and Albany, New York.\nForts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point (Fort St. Frederic) controlled passage of the lake in colonial times. Important battles were fought at Ticonderoga in 1758 and 1777. A important naval battle was fought in 1776 at Valcour Island: in the Battle of Valcour Island, Benedict Arnold delayed British ships enough to prevent the fall of these forts until the following year, allowing the Continental Army to grow stronger and allowing the later victory at Saratoga.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":39},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":47},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":82},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":95},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":128},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":142},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":163},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":175},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":210},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":217},{"uri":"Samuel_de_Champlain","surface_form":"Samuel de Champlain","offset":226},{"uri":"1609","surface_form":"1609","offset":265},{"uri":"Arc","surface_form":"arc","offset":375},{"uri":"Labrador%2C_Canada","surface_form":"Labrador","offset":384},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":405},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":414},{"uri":"Northwest_Territories","surface_form":"Northwest Territories","offset":441},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":511},{"uri":"Lake_Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":526},{"uri":"Lake_Erie","surface_form":"Erie","offset":535},{"uri":"Lake_Huron","surface_form":"Huron","offset":541},{"uri":"Lake_Superior","surface_form":"Superior","offset":548},{"uri":"Lake_Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":561},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":639},{"uri":"Thirteen_Colonies","surface_form":"colonial","offset":876},{"uri":"Saint_Lawrence_River","surface_form":"Saint Lawrence","offset":977},{"uri":"Hudson_River","surface_form":"Hudson","offset":1000},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"Boat","offset":1016},{"uri":"Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu%2C_Quebec","surface_form":"Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu","offset":1149},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":1175},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":1236},{"uri":"Whitehall_(town)%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Whitehall","offset":1266},{"uri":"Saratoga%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Saratoga","offset":1335},{"uri":"Glens_Falls%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Glens Falls","offset":1345},{"uri":"Albany%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Albany","offset":1362},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":1370},{"uri":"Fort","surface_form":"Fort","offset":1380},{"uri":"Fort_Ticonderoga","surface_form":"Ticonderoga","offset":1389},{"uri":"Crown_Point%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Crown Point","offset":1405},{"uri":"Fort_St._Frederic","surface_form":"Fort St. Frederic","offset":1418},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":1497},{"uri":"1758","surface_form":"1758","offset":1535},{"uri":"1777","surface_form":"1777","offset":1544},{"uri":"1776","surface_form":"1776","offset":1589},{"uri":"Valcour_Island","surface_form":"Valcour Island","offset":1597},{"uri":"Battle_of_Valcour_Island","surface_form":"Battle of Valcour Island","offset":1620},{"uri":"Benedict_Arnold","surface_form":"Benedict Arnold","offset":1646},{"uri":"Continental_Army","surface_form":"Continental Army","offset":1765},{"uri":"Victory","surface_form":"victory","offset":1822},{"uri":"Saratoga_campaign","surface_form":"Saratoga","offset":1833}]}
