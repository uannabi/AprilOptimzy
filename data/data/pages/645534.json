{"id":645534,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_South_Western_Railway","text":"=\"preserve\">The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) was a railway company in England from 1838 to 1922. It started as the London and Southampton Railway from Waterloo station to Southampton.\nLater, the network extended to Plymouth via Salisbury and Exeter. There were branches to Ilfracombe and Padstow. Beyond Southampton there were branches to Bournemouth and Weymouth. The LSWR also had many routes connecting towns in Hampshire and Berkshire, including Portsmouth and Reading.\nIn the grouping of railways in 1923 the LSWR joined with other railways to create the Southern Railway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":62},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":81},{"uri":"Waterloo_station","surface_form":"Waterloo station","offset":162},{"uri":"Southampton","surface_form":"Southampton","offset":182},{"uri":"Plymouth","surface_form":"Plymouth","offset":226},{"uri":"Salisbury","surface_form":"Salisbury","offset":239},{"uri":"Exeter","surface_form":"Exeter","offset":253},{"uri":"Ilfracombe","surface_form":"Ilfracombe","offset":284},{"uri":"Padstow","surface_form":"Padstow","offset":299},{"uri":"Southampton","surface_form":"Southampton","offset":315},{"uri":"Bournemouth","surface_form":"Bournemouth","offset":350},{"uri":"Weymouth%2C_Dorset","surface_form":"Weymouth","offset":366},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":426},{"uri":"Berkshire","surface_form":"Berkshire","offset":440},{"uri":"Portsmouth","surface_form":"Portsmouth","offset":461},{"uri":"Reading%2C_Berkshire","surface_form":"Reading","offset":476},{"uri":"Railways_Act_1921","surface_form":"grouping of railways in 1923","offset":492},{"uri":"Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)","surface_form":"Southern Railway","offset":571}]}
