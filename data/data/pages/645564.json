{"id":645564,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%2C_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway","text":"e=\"preserve\">The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR was a railway company in England from 1846 to 1922. Its territory formed a rough triangle, with London at its apex, most of the coastline of Sussex as its base, and a large part of Surrey. The LBSCR had the most direct routes from London to the south coast seaside resorts of Brighton, Eastbourne, Worthing, Littlehampton and Bognor Regis, and to the ports of Newhaven and Shoreham-by-Sea. It served the inland towns/cities of Chichester, Horsham, East Grinstead and Lewes, and jointly served Croydon, Tunbridge Wells, Dorking and Guildford. At the London end was a complicated suburban and outer-suburban network of lines emanating from London Bridge and Victoria, and shared interests in two cross-London lines.\nThe LBSCR was formed by a merger of five companies in 1846. On 1 January 1923, it became part of the Southern Railway under the Railways Act 1921.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":90},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":161},{"uri":"Sussex","surface_form":"Sussex","offset":206},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":246},{"uri":"Seaside_resort","surface_form":"seaside resort","offset":322},{"uri":"Brighton","surface_form":"Brighton","offset":341},{"uri":"Eastbourne","surface_form":"Eastbourne","offset":351},{"uri":"Worthing","surface_form":"Worthing","offset":363},{"uri":"Littlehampton","surface_form":"Littlehampton","offset":373},{"uri":"Bognor_Regis","surface_form":"Bognor Regis","offset":391},{"uri":"Newhaven%2C_East_Sussex","surface_form":"Newhaven","offset":425},{"uri":"Shoreham-by-Sea","surface_form":"Shoreham-by-Sea","offset":438},{"uri":"Chichester","surface_form":"Chichester","offset":492},{"uri":"Horsham","surface_form":"Horsham","offset":504},{"uri":"East_Grinstead","surface_form":"East Grinstead","offset":513},{"uri":"Lewes","surface_form":"Lewes","offset":532},{"uri":"Croydon","surface_form":"Croydon","offset":558},{"uri":"Tunbridge_Wells","surface_form":"Tunbridge Wells","offset":567},{"uri":"Dorking","surface_form":"Dorking","offset":584},{"uri":"Guildford","surface_form":"Guildford","offset":596},{"uri":"London_Bridge_station","surface_form":"London Bridge","offset":703},{"uri":"London_Victoria_station","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":721},{"uri":"Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)","surface_form":"Southern Railway","offset":880},{"uri":"Railways_Act_1921","surface_form":"Railways Act 1921","offset":907}]}
