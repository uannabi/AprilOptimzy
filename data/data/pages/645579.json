{"id":645579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway","text":"=\"preserve\">The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) was a major British railway company before the 1923 Grouping. It was created in 1847 from an amalgamation of several existing railways. It was the third largest railway system based in Northern England. Only the Midland Railway and the North Eastern Railway were bigger.\nIt was the first mainline railway to introduce electrification of some of its lines. It also ran steamboat services across the Irish Sea and North Sea. It was a bigger shipowner than any other British railway company.\nIt amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922. One year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway under the Railways Act 1921.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":76},{"uri":"Railways_Act_1921","surface_form":"1923 Grouping","offset":103},{"uri":"Northern_England","surface_form":"Northern England","offset":241},{"uri":"Midland_Railway","surface_form":"Midland Railway","offset":268},{"uri":"North_Eastern_Railway","surface_form":"North Eastern Railway","offset":292},{"uri":"Railway_electrification_system","surface_form":"electrification","offset":374},{"uri":"Steamboat","surface_form":"steamboat","offset":424},{"uri":"Irish_Sea","surface_form":"Irish Sea","offset":454},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":468},{"uri":"London_and_North_Western_Railway","surface_form":"London and North Western Railway","offset":569},{"uri":"London%2C_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway","surface_form":"London, Midland and Scottish Railway","offset":694},{"uri":"Railways_Act_1921","surface_form":"Railways Act 1921","offset":741}]}
