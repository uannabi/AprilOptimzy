{"id":645596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Stone","text":"Roger Jason Stone (born Roger Joseph Stone Jr.; August 27, 1952) is an American political consultant, lobbyist and strategist. He was born in Norwalk, Connecticut.\nStone is known for his use of opposition research, studying opposing candidates to find bad things about them. Usually he works for candidates of the Republican Party. Since the 1970s, Stone has worked on the campaigns of key Republican politicians such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, Bob Dole and Donald Trump.\nStone is the subject of a \"Netflix\" documentary movie, titled \"Get Me Roger Stone\", which focused on his past and role in the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump.\nStone officially left the Trump campaign on August 8, 2015; however, it has been reported that, as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, two associates of Stone have claimed that he collaborated with WikiLeaks owner Julian Assange in the spring of 2016 to discredit Hillary Clinton's campaign. Stone has denied this.\nOn January 25, 2019, Stone was arrested at his Fort Lauderdale, Florida, home in connection with Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation and charged in an indictment with witness tampering, obstructing an official proceeding, and five counts of making false statements. Stone pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in press interviews.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_consulting","surface_form":"political consultant","offset":80},{"uri":"Lobbying","surface_form":"lobbyist","offset":102},{"uri":"Strategist","surface_form":"strategist","offset":115},{"uri":"Norwalk%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Norwalk, Connecticut","offset":142},{"uri":"Opposition_research","surface_form":"opposition research","offset":194},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":314},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":421},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":436},{"uri":"Jack_Kemp","surface_form":"Jack Kemp","offset":451},{"uri":"Bob_Dole","surface_form":"Bob Dole","offset":462},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":475},{"uri":"Netflix","surface_form":"Netflix","offset":516},{"uri":"Get_Me_Roger_Stone","surface_form":"Get Me Roger Stone","offset":552},{"uri":"Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016 presidential campaign","offset":615},{"uri":"Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections","surface_form":"Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections","offset":797},{"uri":"Julian_Assange","surface_form":"Julian Assange","offset":934},{"uri":"Fort_Lauderdale%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Fort Lauderdale, Florida","offset":1082},{"uri":"Robert_Mueller","surface_form":"Robert Mueller's","offset":1132},{"uri":"Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%93present)","surface_form":"special counsel investigation","offset":1149},{"uri":"Witness_tampering","surface_form":"witness tampering","offset":1213}]}
