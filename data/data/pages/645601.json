Clinton was found not guilty of these charges by the Senate on February 12, 1999.\nFour charges were considered by the full House of Representatives; two passed, making Clinton the second president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson in 1868.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":62},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":113},{"uri":"Impeachment","surface_form":"impeachment","offset":128},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":143},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":166},{"uri":"Perjury","surface_form":"perjury","offset":221},{"uri":"Obstruction_of_justice","surface_form":"obstruction of justice","offset":240},{"uri":"Paula_Jones","surface_form":"Paula Jones","offset":348},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":414},{"uri":"Andrew_Johnson","surface_form":"Andrew Johnson","offset":581}]}
