{"id":645616,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Overhead_Railway","text":"It was also the second oldest electric metro in the world. The only earlier one was the 1890 City and South London Railway. In the early 1900s electric trains ran on the electrified Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to Southport and Aintree. Special trains to Aintree for the horse race meetings ran twice a year after regular services were withdrawn. Being a local railway it was not nationalised in 1948.\nIn 1955, a report into the structure of the many viaducts showed major repairs were needed that the company could not afford. The railway closed at the end of 1956. Despite public protests the structures were dismantled in the following year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City_and_South_London_Railway","surface_form":"City and South London Railway","offset":93},{"uri":"Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway","surface_form":"Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway","offset":182},{"uri":"Southport","surface_form":"Southport","offset":218},{"uri":"Aintree","surface_form":"Aintree","offset":232},{"uri":"Nationalization","surface_form":"nationalised","offset":384}]}
