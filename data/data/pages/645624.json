{"id":645624,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Baptist_Allgaier","text":"e=\"preserve\">Johann Baptist Allgaier (June 19, 1763, Schussenried \u2013 January 3, 1823, Vienna) was a German-Austrian chess master and theoretician. He was also the author of the first chess handbook in German \u2013 \"Neue theoretisch-praktische Anweisung zum Schachspiel\" (Vienna 1795\u201396).\nBiography.\nJohann Baptist Allgaier was born in 1763 in the Duchy of W\u00FCrttemberg.\u00A0His father, Georg Allgaier, worked at a monastery as a \"Hofmeister\", the person in charge of the education of the children of the rich and noble families. Johann's father wanted him to study theology. On a trip to Poland he learned to play chess. In 1798, he moved to Vienna and joined the army. He was able to improve his chess skills. In 1780, he won a game with a prize of 1500 florins and became Vienna's best player. He taught many people to play chess, including\u00A0the sons and brothers of the Emperor Francis II.\nAllgaier fought in the Napoleonic wars between Austria and France. In 1809, he worked in an army hospital, where he became ill with\u00A0asthma. When the hospital was moved to Prague he became its\u00A0accountant.\u00A0He returned to Vienna in 1816 where the Emperor gave him a small\u00A0pension. To make extra money, he played chess in the caf\u00E9s.\u00A0His games were said to be\u00A0brilliant and focused on attacking. When he\u00A0played, people would come to watch. One man,\u00A0Santo Vito, wrote down some of these games which were included in Allgaier's book. He would play anyone for the price of one\u00A0gulden. The price also included a short lesson after the game. Allgaier was always looking for ways to make money. This is probably why he worked with\u00A0M\u00E4lzel\u00A0to operate the Turk. Allgaier played hidden inside the chess machine in 1809.\u00A0He is believed to be the player controlling the Turk when it won a game against\u00A0Napoleon at Sch\u00F6nbrunn Palace.\nIn December 1822, he was sent to the military hospital in Vienna and died a few days later of dropsy.\nInfluence on chess.\nIn 1795 and 1796\u00A0 he published his book \"Neue Theoretische-praktische Anweisung zum Schachspiel.\" This was said to be the best chess book of the time. It was reprinted several times, the seventh and final edition was in 1843.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":85},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":99},{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":115},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":200},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastery","offset":404},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":555},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":578},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":632},{"uri":"Austro-Hungarian_gulden","surface_form":"florins","offset":745},{"uri":"Francis_I_of_Austria","surface_form":"Francis II","offset":870},{"uri":"Napoleonic_wars","surface_form":"Napoleonic wars","offset":905},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":929},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":941},{"uri":"Asthma","surface_form":"asthma","offset":1014},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":1053},{"uri":"Accountant","surface_form":"accountant","offset":1074},{"uri":"Pension","surface_form":"pension","offset":1151},{"uri":"Austro-Hungarian_gulden","surface_form":"gulden","offset":1451},{"uri":"Johann_Nepomuk_Maelzel","surface_form":"M\u00E4lzel","offset":1602},{"uri":"The_Turk","surface_form":"the Turk","offset":1620},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":1767},{"uri":"Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace","surface_form":"Sch\u00F6nbrunn Palace","offset":1779},{"uri":"Oedema","surface_form":"dropsy","offset":1892}]}
