{"id":645657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthe_Henri_Boncourt","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hyacinthe Henri Boncourt (1765? &#x2013; March 23, 1840) was one of the leading chess players in France in the years between 1820 and 1840.\nBiography.\nNot much is known about his life. The date of his birth, 1765, is based\u00A0on a comment by an English chess player,\u00A0George\u00A0Walker,\u00A0that in 1839 Boncourt was about 70 years old.\nBoncourt learned how to play chess from students of the great\u00A0Philidor, including\u00A0Carlier, Bernard and Leger who often played at the Caf\u00E9 de la R\u00E9gence.\nHe was a civil servant, and chess was mostly a hobby for him. He got his best results after he was 60 years old, when after retiring from work, he could spend all his time playing to chess.\nIn 1818, for a brief period, he was one of the players hidden inside the chess machine,\u00A0the Turk. At one time he was sick, and he did not play very well. While he was hiding inside the Turk, he could not stop coughing and he could be heard by people watching. After this, the owner of the Turk,\u00A0M\u00E4lzel,\u00A0added some noisy gears. This was simply to cover any noise coming from the person inside.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":93},{"uri":"George_Walker_(chess_player)","surface_form":"George\u00A0Walker","offset":277},{"uri":"Philidor","surface_form":"Philidor","offset":400},{"uri":"Carlier_(chess_player)","surface_form":"Carlier","offset":420},{"uri":"Bernard_(chess_player)","surface_form":"Bernard","offset":429},{"uri":"Leger_(chess_player)","surface_form":"Leger","offset":441},{"uri":"Caf%C3%A9_de_la_R%C3%A9gence","surface_form":"Caf\u00E9 de la R\u00E9gence","offset":471},{"uri":"Civil_servant","surface_form":"civil servant","offset":500},{"uri":"The_Turk","surface_form":"the Turk","offset":769},{"uri":"Johann_Nepomuk_Maelzel","surface_form":"M\u00E4lzel","offset":976}]}
