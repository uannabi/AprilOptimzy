She was the house minority leader for the Georgia General Assembly and state representative for the 89th House District. She is a member of the Democratic Party.\nAbrams was the Democratic nominee in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election, the first black female major party gubernatorial nominee in the United States. She narrowly lost the general election to Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who, as Secretary of State was in charge of the election and is widely thought to have manipulated the election in his favor by disenfranchising African-American voters.\nIn June 2018 Stacey Abrams joined the 9th annual Augusta Pride festival and talked about her campaign.\nAbrams received a single vote from Rep. Kathleen Rice for the 2019 election for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.\nIn early February 2019, Abrams became the first African-American woman to deliver a State of the Union response to President Trump's earlier delivery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"Georgia_General_Assembly","surface_form":"Georgia General Assembly","offset":159},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":261},{"uri":"Georgia_gubernatorial","surface_form":"Georgia gubernatorial","offset":325},{"uri":"Georgia_Secretary_of_State","surface_form":"Secretary of State","offset":489},{"uri":"Brian_Kemp","surface_form":"Brian Kemp","offset":508},{"uri":"Kathleen_Rice","surface_form":"Kathleen Rice","offset":833},{"uri":"2019_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election","surface_form":"2019 election","offset":855},{"uri":"Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Speaker of the United States House of Representatives","offset":873},{"uri":"State_of_the_Union","surface_form":"State of the Union","offset":1012},{"uri":"President_Trump","surface_form":"President Trump","offset":1043}]}
