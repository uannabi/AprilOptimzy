{"id":64572,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape","text":"Inkscape is a vector graphics (pictures made from lines instead of dots) drawing program published under the GNU General Public License. Its stated goal is to become a really good drawing tool while being able to fit in with standards for SVG graphics.\nInkscape was first made for Linux, but now it is cross-platform and runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like operating systems. As of 2007, Inkscape is actively being made better, and new features are added all the time.\nHistory.\nInkscape began in 2003 as a fork (break-off) of the Sodipodi project. Sodipodi, developed since 1999, was itself based on Raph Levien's Gill (Gnome Illustration Application).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vector_graphics","surface_form":"vector graphics","offset":14},{"uri":"GNU_General_Public_License","surface_form":"GNU General Public License","offset":109},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":281},{"uri":"Cross-platform","surface_form":"cross-platform","offset":302},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":329},{"uri":"Mac_OS_X","surface_form":"Mac OS X","offset":348},{"uri":"Unix","surface_form":"Unix","offset":368},{"uri":"Sodipodi","surface_form":"Sodipodi","offset":551},{"uri":"Raph_Levien","surface_form":"Raph Levien","offset":621}]}
