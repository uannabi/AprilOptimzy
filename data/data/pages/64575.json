{"id":64575,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_grant","text":"=\"preserve\">A land grant is a gift of real estate - land or privileges - made by a government or other authority as a reward for services to an individual, especially as rewards for military service. Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies to help develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries.\nRoman soldiers were given rewards at the end of their service including cash or land (\"praemia\"). Augustus fixed the amount in AD 5 at 3000 denarii and by the time of Caracalla it had risen to 5000 denarii.\nIn old California, the King of Spain frequently gave land to people he liked, or who helped him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Real_estate","surface_form":"real estate","offset":38},{"uri":"Reward","surface_form":"reward","offset":118},{"uri":"Military_service","surface_form":"military service","offset":182},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":326},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":332},{"uri":"Augustus","surface_form":"Augustus","offset":424},{"uri":"Caracalla","surface_form":"Caracalla","offset":493},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":540},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":564}]}
