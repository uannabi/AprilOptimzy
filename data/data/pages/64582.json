{"id":64582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa","text":"Mother Teresa (born Skopje,North Macedonia), 26 August 1910 \u2013 5 September 1997), was a Roman Catholic nun who started the Missionaries of Charity and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work with people.For over forty years, she took care of needs of those without money, those who were sick, those without parents, and those dying in Calcutta (Kolkata), guided in part by the ideals of Saint Francis of Assisi.\nAs the Missionaries of Charity grew under Mother's leadership, they expanded their ministry to other countries. By the 1970s she had become internationally well known as an advocate for the poor and helpless, due in part to a movie and book, \"Something Beautiful for God\" by Malcolm Muggeridge. She did not think women had the right to have abortions and said \"The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me?\".\nFollowing her death she was beatified (the first stage of sainthood) by Pope John Paul II and given the title Blessed Teresa of Calcutta.\nCriticism.\nMother Teresa received criticism over the years, especially in recent years as debate about sex and abortion grew. Christopher Hitchens says that, instead of trying to help the poor, she encouraged them to endure pain and continue to suffer. Hitchens also thinks she was against ending poverty and raising the social status of women. Hitchens wrote a book on Teresa called \"The Missionary Position\". In an article for Slate, Hitchens writes \"MT was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":87},{"uri":"Nun","surface_form":"nun","offset":102},{"uri":"Missionaries_of_Charity","surface_form":"Missionaries of Charity","offset":122},{"uri":"Nobel_Peace_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":158},{"uri":"Nun","surface_form":"For over forty years, she took care of needs of those without money, those who were sick, those without parents, and those dying in","offset":209},{"uri":"Calcutta","surface_form":"Calcutta","offset":341},{"uri":"Canonization","surface_form":"Saint","offset":393},{"uri":"Francis_of_Assisi","surface_form":"Francis of Assisi","offset":399},{"uri":"Charity_(practice)","surface_form":"advocate for the poor and helpless","offset":591},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":644},{"uri":"Malcolm_Muggeridge","surface_form":"Malcolm Muggeridge","offset":693},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":759},{"uri":"Canonization","surface_form":"sainthood","offset":979},{"uri":"Pope_John_Paul_II","surface_form":"Pope John Paul II","offset":993},{"uri":"Criticism","surface_form":"criticism","offset":1093},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":1162},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":1170},{"uri":"Christopher_Hitchens","surface_form":"Christopher Hitchens","offset":1185}]}
