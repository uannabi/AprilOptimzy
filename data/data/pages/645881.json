{"id":645881,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Maratha Empire or the Maratha Confederacy was a grouping of Indian states that dominated much of the Indian subcontinent in the 17th and 18th centuries. The empire formally existed from 1674 until 1818. The Marathas are given much of the credit for ending Mughal rule in India.\nThe Marathas were a warrior people from the western Deccan Plateau (present-day Maharashtra) that rose to prominence by establishing \"self-rule of Hindu/Indian people\" in their region. The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of Shivaji who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty and the Mughal Empire and formed a kingdom with Raigad as his capital. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent. Their power was eventually ended by the series of wars they fought against the British.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mughal_Empire","surface_form":"Mughal rule","offset":273},{"uri":"Deccan_Plateau","surface_form":"Deccan Plateau","offset":347},{"uri":"Maharashtra","surface_form":"Maharashtra","offset":375}]}
