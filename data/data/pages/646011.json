{"id":646011,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Socialists_of_America","text":"Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is an organization of democratic socialist and left-social democratic and labor members in the United States. It is a member of the Socialist International (SI) from its founding in 1982.\nDSA has its roots in the Socialist Party of America (SPA), whose most prominent leaders included Eugene V. Debs, Norman Thomas and Michael Harrington.\nThe organization has at times endorsed Democratic electoral candidates such as Walter Mondale, Jesse Jackson, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders as well as Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.\nBy the end of 2017, DSA membership had risen from over 6,000 to over 32,000, due to the youth reaction to the presidency of Donald Trump, hence becoming by far not only the largest socialist organization in the United States in the 21st century. Many of the new members were relatively wealthy millennials.\nOn June 26, DSA member and endorsee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won the Democratic primary against incumbent Representative Joseph Crowley in New York's 14th congressional district in a surprise upset. As a result of her win, 1,000 new members joining the organization the next day, approximately 35 times the daily average\nThe DSA resolved not to campaign for any candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election other than Bernie Sanders; however, many members encouraged people to vote for Joe Biden, even though he was not endorsed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":45},{"uri":"Democratic_socialism","surface_form":"democratic socialist","offset":61},{"uri":"Left-wing_politics","surface_form":"left","offset":86},{"uri":"Social_democracy","surface_form":"social democratic","offset":91},{"uri":"Labour_movement","surface_form":"labor","offset":113},{"uri":"Socialist_International","surface_form":"Socialist International","offset":171},{"uri":"Socialist_Party_of_America","surface_form":"Socialist Party of America","offset":252},{"uri":"Eugene_V._Debs","surface_form":"Eugene V.
