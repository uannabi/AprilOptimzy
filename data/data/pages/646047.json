{"id":646047,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Nation_Army","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Seven Nation Army\" (also stylized as \"7 Nation Army\") is a song by American rock duo the White Stripes. It was released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, \"Elephant\", in March 2003, and reached number one on the Alternative Songs chart for three weeks in a row. It won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.\nFollowing a speech by Jeremy Corbyn at Wirral Live music festival in May 2017, supporters in the audience began to chant Corbyn's name to the tune of the song's riff. This was repeated on several times in the run-up to the British general election 2017, and afterwards at the 2017 Glastonbury Festival, where Corbyn appeared on the Pyramid stage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":90},{"uri":"The_White_Stripes","surface_form":"the White Stripes","offset":99},{"uri":"Elephant_(album)","surface_form":"Elephant","offset":186},{"uri":"Alternative_Songs","surface_form":"Alternative Songs","offset":242},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":303},{"uri":"Best_Rock_Song","surface_form":"Best Rock Song","offset":320},{"uri":"Jeremy_Corbyn","surface_form":"Jeremy Corbyn","offset":358},{"uri":"British_general_election_2017","surface_form":"British general election 2017","offset":559},{"uri":"Glastonbury_Festival","surface_form":"Glastonbury Festival","offset":617}]}
