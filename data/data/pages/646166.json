{"id":646166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bot","text":"Issues with bots.\nSocieties are going through a rapid learning process at present. The freedom of bots to mine data is challenged. By mining data is meant collecting information about use, and about users, so as to advance some commercial or other purpose. In the European Union, for example, bots must now ask for permission to mine data from users. Before, they could collect any data they liked from users inorder to promote the welfare of the companies that used them.\nThere is a Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases. It is a directive of the European Union in the field of copyright law, made under the Treaty of Rome. The need to protect the data of \"users\" is a more recent development.\nData mining is certain to be extremely important in the future. On Wikipedia the use of bots is frequent (see link above), but the use of data mining is minimal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Data_mining","surface_form":"mine data","offset":106},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":264},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":509},{"uri":"European_Council","surface_form":"Council","offset":533},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":621},{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":652},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Rome","surface_form":"Treaty of Rome","offset":682}]}
