{"id":64631,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin","text":"Resin is a hydrocarbon secreted by many plants, especially coniferous trees.\nPlants evolved many complex chemicals as defences against herbivores. That may be the origin of these resins, which are certainly not good to eat. Plants secrete resins for their protective benefits in response to injury.\nThe resin protects the plant from insects and pathogens. Resins confound a wide range of herbivores, insects, and pathogens. The volatile phenolic compounds may attract benefactors, that is, parasitoids or predators of the herbivores which attack the plant.\nHumans value resins for the chemics in them, and for their many uses. They are used in varnishes, adhesives, as raw materials for organic synthesis, or for incense and perfume. Fossilized resins are the source of amber. The term is also used for synthetic substances with similar properties.\nResins are composed of atoms such as carbon, hydrogen and a little oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur etc. combined together with certain chemical-bond. Synthetic resins are used in laminates, adhesives, flooring, linings, etc.\nRosin.\nRosin, (also called 'colophony' or 'Greek pitch') is a solid form of resin. It is got from pines and some other plants, mostly conifers. Heating fresh liquid resin vaporizes light volatiles like terpenes.\nRosin is semi-transparent and yellow to black in colour. The term \"colophony\" comes from \"colophonia resina\" or \"resin from the pine trees of Colophon\", an ancient Ionic city.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbon","offset":11},{"uri":"Secretion","surface_form":"secreted","offset":23},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":40},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"coniferous trees","offset":59},{"uri":"Evolved","surface_form":"evolved","offset":84},{"uri":"Defence_against_herbivory","surface_form":"defences against herbivores","offset":118},{"uri":"Phenol","surface_form":"phenolic compounds","offset":437},{"uri":"Parasitoid","surface_form":"parasitoid","offset":490},{"uri":"Varnish","surface_form":"varnish","offset":644},{"uri":"Adhesive","surface_form":"adhesive","offset":655},{"uri":"Organic_synthesis","surface_form":"organic synthesis","offset":687},{"uri":"Incense","surface_form":"incense","offset":713},{"uri":"Perfume","surface_form":"perfume","offset":725},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"Fossil","offset":734},{"uri":"Amber","surface_form":"amber","offset":770},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"pine","offset":1168},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":1189},{"uri":"Pinophyta","surface_form":"conifers","offset":1204},{"uri":"Volatiles","surface_form":"volatiles","offset":1257},{"uri":"Terpene","surface_form":"terpene","offset":1272},{"uri":"Ionia","surface_form":"Ionic","offset":1446}]}
