{"id":64633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish","text":"e=\"preserve\">Varnish is a transparent, hard, protective finish or film primarily used in wood finishing but also for other materials. Varnish is traditionally a combination of a drying oil, a resin, and a solvent.\nResin.\nMost resin or \"gum\" varnishes are made of a natural substance dissolved in a solvent. The two main types of natural varnishes are \"spirit varnish\" (which uses alcohol as a solvent) and turpentine or petroleum-based varnish. Some resins are soluble in both alcohol and turpentine.\nShellac is a very widely used single component resin varnish that is dissolved in alcohol. It is not used outdoors or where it will touch water several times, such as around a sink or bathtub. insects in South Asia make it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Transparency","surface_form":"transparent","offset":26},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":89},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":192},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":205},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":226},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":298},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":380},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"petroleum","offset":420},{"uri":"Shellac","surface_form":"Shellac","offset":501},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":583},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":694},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":705}]}
