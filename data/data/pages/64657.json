{"id":64657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII","text":"Edward VII (9 November 1841 \u2013 6 May 1910) was the king of the United Kingdom from 1901 to 1910, which is called the Edwardian period. He was the first British monarch whose royal house was called the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The name was changed to Windsor by his son, George V of the United Kingdom, in 1917 and is still used today.\nEdward was born Albert Edward and was the oldest son of Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert. He was Prince of Wales and heir to the throne for longer than any other person (up until that time). His mother reigned for 63 years and Edward was 59 years old when he became King. In his younger years as Prince of Wales, he was known as a playboy and popularized many trends in fashion. He was married to Alexandra of Denmark, but had many mistresses.\nEdward only ruled as King for nine years but made a lasting impression. He became increasingly popular with his people and was credited as a peacemaker for his work in maintaining world stability at a time when war seemed to be looming. He died at the age of 68 in 1910. Four years later the peace he worked so hard to keep was broken with the declaration of World War I (1914\u20131918).\nFamily and legacy.\nEdward VII was the father of King George V and grandfather of King Edward VIII and King George VI. He is also the great-grandfather of the present queen, Elizabeth II. There are a number of statues of Edward VII around the British Isles and Commonwealth realms.\nEdward was given a grand state funeral with the largest gathering of royalty taken place anywhere in the 20th century. It included the likes of German Kaiser Wilheim II (who would later be at war with Britain) and Russian Tsar Nicholas II as well as many others. For the first time in royal history, Edward lay in state for the people to pay their last respects, a reflection of his immense popularity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":50},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":62},{"uri":"Edwardian_period","surface_form":"Edwardian period","offset":116},{"uri":"Royal_house","surface_form":"royal house","offset":173},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha","offset":209},{"uri":"House_of_Windsor","surface_form":"Windsor","offset":256},{"uri":"George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George V of the United Kingdom","offset":276},{"uri":"Queen_Victoria","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":397},{"uri":"Prince_Albert","surface_form":"Prince Albert","offset":429},{"uri":"Prince_of_Wales","surface_form":"Prince of Wales","offset":451},{"uri":"Playboy","surface_form":"playboy","offset":685},{"uri":"Alexandra_of_Denmark","surface_form":"Alexandra of Denmark","offset":751},{"uri":"Mistress_(lover)","surface_form":"mistresses","offset":786},{"uri":"Peace_makers","surface_form":"peacemaker","offset":939},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1157},{"uri":"George_V","surface_form":"George V","offset":1235},{"uri":"Edward_VIII","surface_form":"Edward VIII","offset":1268},{"uri":"George_VI","surface_form":"George VI","offset":1289},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II","surface_form":"Elizabeth II","offset":1355},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":1424},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realms","surface_form":"Commonwealth realms","offset":1442},{"uri":"State_funeral","surface_form":"state funeral","offset":1488},{"uri":"Wilhelm_II_of_Germany","surface_form":"Wilheim II","offset":1621},{"uri":"Nicholas_II","surface_form":"Nicholas II","offset":1690},{"uri":"Lying_in_state","surface_form":"lay in state","offset":1770}]}
