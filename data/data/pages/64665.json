{"id":64665,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone","text":"\"Home Alone\" is a 1990 American comedy action movie mostly set in Chicago, Illinois, Paris, Dallas, and Scranton. It was written and produced by 20th Century Fox by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus. It stars Macaulay Culkin and features Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Roberts Blossom, and John Candy.\nThe film follows Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin), an eight-year old boy who is mistakenly left behind by his family when they go on a vacation to France, over Christmas. While his family is gone, Kevin initially relishes being alone and learns to take care of himself, but soon his excitement sours as he must stop two bumbling burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), who are planning to rob every house in his neighborhood, from trying to burgle his house too by setting up a series of booby traps. After falling for most of Kevin's booby traps, Harry and Marv trap him in a vacant house that they robbed earlier and plan to kill Kevin, but his elderly friendly neighbor, Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom), sneaks in, knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel, takes Kevin home, and the burglars get arrested. The next morning, it is Christmas and Kevin's parents and siblings come back, while his aunt, uncle, and cousins are still in France.\nThe film was very popular and was followed by four sequels (two theatrical sequels and two made-for-television films): ' (1992). This film brought back most of the original film's cast and has a similar plot and continuity. \"Home Alone 3\" (1997) had different kids and villains.
