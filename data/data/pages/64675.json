Hafez was born in Shiraz, Iran. Hafez learnt the Quran by heart at an early age. His poems are collected in Divan e Hafez. William Jones translated his work into English in 1771.\nLife.\nDespite his profound effect on Persian life and culture and his enduring popularity and influence, few details of his life are known, and particularly about his early life there is a great deal of more or less mythical anecdote. Some of the early tazkeras (biographical sketches) mentioning Hafez are generally considered unreliable. One early document discussing Hafez' life is the preface of his Div\u0101n, which was written by an unknown contemporary of Hafez whose name may have been Mo\u1E25ammad Goland\u0101m. The generally accepted modern edition of Hafez's Div\u0101n is known as \"Qazvini-\u1E20ani\", edited by Mo\u1E25ammad Qazvini and Q\u0101sem \u1E20ani.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Persian_people","surface_form":"Persian","offset":146},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":154},{"uri":"Shiraz","surface_form":"Shiraz","offset":178},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":186},{"uri":"Quran","surface_form":"Quran","offset":209},{"uri":"Divan_e_Hafez","surface_form":"Divan e Hafez","offset":268},{"uri":"William_Jones","surface_form":"William Jones","offset":283}]}
