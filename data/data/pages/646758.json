He received the plurality of votes, 35% as opposed to 21% of rival Alexander Van der Bellen, in the first round. The much closer results of the second round of voting (49.7%/50.3%) were annulled by the Constitutional Court due to voting irregularities affecting nearly 78,000 votes, requiring the election to be re-held. In the re-run on 4 December 2016 he received 46% of the vote and lost the election to Van der Bellen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":50},{"uri":"Freedom_Party_of_Austria","surface_form":"Freedom Party","offset":93},{"uri":"President_of_Austria","surface_form":"President of Austria","offset":237},{"uri":"Austrian_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"2016 election","offset":265},{"uri":"Alexander_Van_der_Bellen","surface_form":"Alexander Van der Bellen","offset":347},{"uri":"Constitutional_Court_(Austria)","surface_form":"Constitutional Court","offset":482}]}
