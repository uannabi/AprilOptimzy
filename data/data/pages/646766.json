{"id":646766,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Spanish_general_election","text":"The 2016 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 26 June 2016, to elect the 12th Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 266 seats in the Senate.\nOpinion polling going into the election predicted a growing polarisation between this alliance and the People's Party (PP), which would be fighting to maintain first place nationally.\nIn the end, the alliance suffered a surprise decline in votes and vote share compared to the previous election, while the PP increased its number of votes and seats. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), while clinging on to second place, kept losing votes and seats and scored a new historical low.\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy was re-elected as Prime Minister for a second term in office on 29 October amid public outcry and protest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cortes_Generales","surface_form":"Cortes Generales","offset":86},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Spain","surface_form":"Kingdom of Spain","offset":110},{"uri":"Congress_of_Deputies","surface_form":"Congress of Deputies","offset":149},{"uri":"Senate_of_Spain","surface_form":"Senate","offset":227},{"uri":"Opinion_polling_for_the_Spanish_general_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"Opinion polling","offset":235},{"uri":"People%27s_Party_(Spain)","surface_form":"People's Party","offset":338},{"uri":"Spanish_Socialist_Workers%27_Party","surface_form":"Spanish Socialist Workers' Party","offset":589},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Spain","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":726},{"uri":"Mariano_Rajoy","surface_form":"Mariano Rajoy","offset":741},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Spain","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":773}]}
