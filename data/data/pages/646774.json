{"id":646774,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual","text":"Smart casual is a dress code that is neat yet casual. Oxford defines it as \"neat, conventional, yet relatively informal in style, especially as worn to conform to a particular dress code\". \"Business casual\" is another similar term. It suggests some formality, not really casual in fact.\nDifferent localities, kinds of events, contexts, or cultures have varying interpretations of the dress code.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oxford_English_Dictionary","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":54},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":339}]}
