{"id":646951,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_hypergiant","text":"A yellow hypergiant is a huge hypergiant star. It starts off a mass of about 20\u201360 solar masses, but it soon loses about half that mass (because they are very unstable). It has a spectral class from A to K.\nThey are amongst the most luminous stars, with absolute magnitude (MV) around \u22129. They are very rare: only 15 are known in the Milky Way and six of those are in a single cluster.\nThey are sometimes referred to as 'cool hypergiants' in comparison to O- and B-type stars, and sometimes as 'warm hypergiants' in comparison to red supergiants. Yellow hypergiants have evolved off the main sequence and have little hydrogen left in their centres.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hypergiant","surface_form":"hypergiant","offset":30},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":41},{"uri":"Solar_mass","surface_form":"solar mass","offset":83},{"uri":"Unstable","surface_form":"unstable","offset":159},{"uri":"Spectral_class","surface_form":"spectral class","offset":179},{"uri":"Luminous","surface_form":"luminous","offset":233},{"uri":"Absolute_magnitude","surface_form":"absolute magnitude","offset":254},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":334},{"uri":"Westerlund_1","surface_form":"a single cluster","offset":368},{"uri":"Red_giant","surface_form":"red supergiant","offset":530},{"uri":"Main_sequence","surface_form":"main sequence","offset":587}]}
