The peninsula is east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a northwestern geographic divider, separating Central America from the rest of North America.\nThe peninsula includes the Mexican states of Yucat\u00E1n, Campeche, and Quintana Roo; the northern part of Belize; and Guatemala's northern department of El Pet\u00E9n. Mexican states on the isthmus to the south and west of the peninsula include Chiapas and Tabasco.\nThe Chicxulub crater is on the north coast. It is believed to be made by the impact that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":72},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":95},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":115},{"uri":"Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec","surface_form":"Isthmus of Tehuantepec","offset":140},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geographic","offset":179},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":210},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":243},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican states","offset":285},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_(state)","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n","offset":303},{"uri":"Campeche","surface_form":"Campeche","offset":312},{"uri":"Quintana_Roo","surface_form":"Quintana Roo","offset":326},{"uri":"Belize","surface_form":"Belize","offset":361},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":373},{"uri":"Departments_of_Guatemala","surface_form":"department","offset":394},{"uri":"El_Pet%C3%A9n","surface_form":"El Pet\u00E9n","offset":408},{"uri":"Chiapas","surface_form":"Chiapas","offset":495},{"uri":"Tabasco_(state)","surface_form":"Tabasco","offset":507},{"uri":"Chicxulub_crater","surface_form":"Chicxulub crater","offset":520},{"uri":"K/T_extinction_event","surface_form":"extinction of the dinosaurs","offset":616}]}
