{"id":64721,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury","text":"=\"preserve\">The inch of mercury (inHg or \"Hg) was a non-SI unit of pressure. It was used for measuring barometric pressure, (the thickness of air), in weather forecasts, and aviation (flying), but was replaced by the pascal.\nIt is the amount of pressure that a column of mercury that is one inch tall has at 0 \u00B0C at the standard acceleration of gravity, or how fast things speed up as they are falling because of gravity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":56},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":67},{"uri":"Barometric_pressure","surface_form":"barometric pressure","offset":103},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":151},{"uri":"Aviation","surface_form":"aviation","offset":174},{"uri":"Pascal_(unit)","surface_form":"pascal","offset":217},{"uri":"Mercury_(element)","surface_form":"mercury","offset":271},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":291},{"uri":"Standard_gravity","surface_form":"standard acceleration of gravity","offset":320},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":413}]}
