{"id":647227,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darawiish_(Dhulbahante_state)","text":"The Darawiish (also spelled Daraawiish State) was a Dhulbahante anti-colonial state geographically correlating with Khatumo and the successor state to the Dhulbahante garaadship. It was a Dhulbahante (Si'iid Harti) state which existed from 1896 to 1921. It was ruled by a government called \"Xarunta\". The supreme commander was Ismail Mire. The head of state was the Sayyid. The Darwiishes began growing in the first Darwiish capital in Dareema Caddo, near Buuhoodle. It ended in the final Darwiish capital in Taleh. The Dhulbahante Sultan Diiriye Guure was also Darawiish sultan.\nTerminology.\nDarwiish may come from \"Al Darawish\" which means \"simple people\" in Arabic. It may also come from \"dar al wiish\" which is Arabic and Balochi for \"land of happy people\". The Darwiish sometimes referred to their opponents as \"kabacad\" or \"gumeysiraac\".\nHistory.\nOn Mar 3, 1905 the \"Mad Mullah\" declared himself \"Sayyid\" of Nogal (other name of the Nugaal valley) in the Khatumo region. His full name was sultan\" Mahamad Abdullah Hasan. The territory coincided approximately with the actual Nugaal area in modern Khatumo State. It was ruled like a kind of sultanate in behalf of the Mahdi.\nHis rule was terminated by Italy in 1911. The Italian victory started on September 3, 1908 when Italian official Di Giorgio conquered Afgoi and the sultan of Ghel\u00E9di with his 5000 men surrendered to the Italians (who won an important battle at Arar\u00E9 and Eyl).\nDuring 1910-1914, Sayyid's capital moved from Illig to Taleex in the heart of Nugaal where he built three garrison forts of massive stone work and a number of houses. He built a \"luxurious\" palace for himself and kept new guards drawn from outcast clans. By 1913, he had dominated the entire hinterland surrounding Khatumo by building forts at Jidali and Ugaadhyahan lands, at Werder in Ali Gheri lands, and Beledweyne in southern Somalia.\nAfter the collapse of Muhammad Abdullah Hassan\u2019s resistance movement, rebellion and revolt occurred with disputes between different tribes in Northern Somalia.\nThe Italian government of Somalia again worked together with the old tribesmen in order to try and keep peace between the several tribes, while maintaining close control over the military.\nSayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (nicknamed the \"Mad Mullah\" by the British) escaped from the Khatumo region in 1920 to Imey Ethiopia, where he later died in 1921.\nSelf-made state.\nIn Downing Street, it was described as a state. Its influence was over the dhulbahante tribe. Unlike the Abyssinians whose preservation in 1906 were supported by Italy, France and Britain, Darawiish became independent by themselves.\nMaaraweyn.\nMaaraweyn was the army of the Darawiish.\nXarunta.\nThe xarunta had ministers called qusuusi. It also had commanders called muqaddim. The most important people in \"Xarunta\" were Xayd Aaden Gallaydh, Ismail Mire, the Sayyid, Xirsi Cartan Boos, Xasan Gaagguf, Xirsiwaal Cashuur, Muuse Taagane, Aw Abbas Xuseen, Afqarshe Xassan Ismail, Macalin Cagadhiig, Shire Cumbaal, Faarax Kaligiimaadhle, Faarax Qarshi, and the four Seed Magan brothers (i.e. Obsiiye, Oogle, Jaamac and Aaden).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Khatumo_State","surface_form":"Khatumo","offset":116},{"uri":"Dhulbahante_garaadship","surface_form":"Dhulbahante garaadship","offset":155},{"uri":"Si%27iid_Harti","surface_form":"Si'iid Harti","offset":201},{"uri":"Ismail_Mire","surface_form":"Ismail Mire","offset":327},{"uri":"Dareema_Caddo","surface_form":"Dareema Caddo","offset":436},{"uri":"Buuhoodle","surface_form":"Buuhoodle","offset":456},{"uri":"Taleh","surface_form":"Taleh","offset":509},{"uri":"Khatumo","surface_form":"Khatumo","offset":961},{"uri":"Khatumo_State","surface_form":"Khatumo State","offset":1103},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1207},{"uri":"Khatumo","surface_form":"Khatumo","offset":1755},{"uri":"Muhammad_Abdullah_Hassan","surface_form":"Muhammad Abdullah Hassan","offset":1902},{"uri":"Mohammed_Abdullah_Hassan","surface_form":"Mohammed Abdullah Hassan","offset":2236},{"uri":"Downing_Street","surface_form":"Downing Street","offset":2412},{"uri":"Maaraweyn","surface_form":"Maaraweyn","offset":2653}]}
