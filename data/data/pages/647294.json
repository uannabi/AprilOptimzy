{"id":647294,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Luxembourg","text":"The Prime Minister of Luxembourg is the head of government in Luxembourg. His official residence and office is in the H\u00F4tel de Bourgogne at 4 rue de la Congr\u00E9gation in the city of Luxembourg.\nBefore 1857, the Prime Minister was the \"President of the Council\". In addition to these titles, the Prime Minister uses the title \"Minister of State\".\nSince the foundation of the party system, only one cabinet (between 1921 and 1925) has not included members of more than one party. Most of the time, governments are grand coalitions of the two largest parties, no matter their ideology; this has made Luxembourg one of the most stable democracies in the world. Two cabinets (between 1945 and 1947) included members of every party represented in the Chamber of Deputies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":40},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":62},{"uri":"Official_residence","surface_form":"official residence","offset":78},{"uri":"H%C3%B4tel_de_Bourgogne_(Luxembourg)","surface_form":"H\u00F4tel de Bourgogne","offset":118},{"uri":"Luxembourg_(city)","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":180},{"uri":"President_of_the_Council_of_Ministers","surface_form":"President of the Council","offset":233},{"uri":"Minister_of_State","surface_form":"Minister of State","offset":324},{"uri":"Party_system","surface_form":"party system","offset":372},{"uri":"Grand_coalition","surface_form":"grand coalition","offset":510},{"uri":"Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Luxembourg","surface_form":"Chamber of Deputies","offset":743}]}
