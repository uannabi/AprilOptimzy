{"id":64756,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_mixer","text":"e=\"preserve\">A static mixer is a piece of equipment that is used to mix liquids in laboratories. It has a unique shape.\nStructure.\nA static mixer is made up of rectangular plates twisted around at 180\u00B0 so that they make a double-helix shape.\n[http://www.noritake.co.jp/eng/eeg/kakouki/image/fea11.gif - Click for a picture]\nLiquids flow along the curves of the static mixer and also are separated by the smooth sides of the mixer. The mixer can also be turned clockwise, or right, and then quickly turned counter-clockwise, or left. This creates opposite currents in the liquid and mixes it more efficiently.\nUses.\nThe static mixer can be used to mix acids and alkalis for a neutralization. It can also be used to mix two liquids that normally wouldn't mix, like oil and water (see emulsion). It separates the particles of the water and oil until they become so small that they mix.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":72},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratories","offset":83},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":651},{"uri":"Alkali","surface_form":"alkali","offset":661},{"uri":"Neutralization","surface_form":"neutral","offset":675},{"uri":"Emulsion","surface_form":"emulsion","offset":782},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":810}]}
