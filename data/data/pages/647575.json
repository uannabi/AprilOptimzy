He resigned from that post in April 2009 in order to stand as a candidate in the July 2009 presidential election, which he won. He was sworn in on 5 August 2009.\nAbdel Aziz also served as the Chairman of the African Union from 2014 to 2015.\nOn July 9, 2020, Mohamed Abdel Aziz was to respond to the convening of a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry tasked with writing a \"report\".
