It borders Bermondsey to the west and Deptford to the south east and faces Wapping and the Isle of Dogs on the north bank of the river.\nThe Rotherhithe Tunnel is a road tunnel under the River Thames. It connects Limehouse in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets north of the river to Rotherhithe south of the river. A road runs through it called the A101. It was opened in 1908. It is a rare example of a road tunnel where road traffic, pedestrians and cyclists all share the same tunnel. Transport for London took over ownership and maintenance of the tunnel in 2001.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":55},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Southwark","surface_form":"London Borough of Southwark","offset":81},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":187},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":214},{"uri":"South_Bank","surface_form":"South Bank","offset":231},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":249},{"uri":"London_Docklands","surface_form":"Docklands","offset":283},{"uri":"Bermondsey","surface_form":"Bermondsey","offset":310},{"uri":"Deptford","surface_form":"Deptford","offset":337},{"uri":"Wapping","surface_form":"Wapping","offset":374},{"uri":"Isle_of_Dogs","surface_form":"Isle of Dogs","offset":390},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":485},{"uri":"Limehouse","surface_form":"Limehouse","offset":511},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets","surface_form":"London Borough of Tower Hamlets","offset":528},{"uri":"Traffic","surface_form":"traffic","offset":726},{"uri":"Pedestrian","surface_form":"pedestrian","offset":735},{"uri":"Cyclist","surface_form":"cyclist","offset":751},{"uri":"Transport_for_London","surface_form":"Transport for London","offset":787}]}
