{"id":647725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirligig_beetle","text":"The whirligig beetles are a family (Gyrinidae) of water beetles that swim on the surface of fresh water.\nThey usually swim on the surface of the water if undisturbed, though they go underwater when threatened. They swim rapidly in circles when alarmed. They have divided eyes which may allow them to see above and below water at the same time.\nThe family includes some 700 living species worldwide, in 15 genera, plus a few fossil species. Most species are very similar in appearance, though they vary in size from 3\u00A0mm to 18\u00A0mm in length. They tend to be flattened and rounded. Their shape is a good approximation to an ellipsoid, with legs and other appendages fitting closely into a streamlined surface.\nBoth larvae and adults are active predators. The adults carry an air bubble under their elytra, and can submerge for long periods if they want to. Mostly they move around on the surface in groups.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Water_beetle","surface_form":"water beetle","offset":50},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":92},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":405},{"uri":"Approximation","surface_form":"approximation","offset":601},{"uri":"Ellipsoid","surface_form":"ellipsoid","offset":621},{"uri":"Streamlining","surface_form":"streamlined","offset":686},{"uri":"Larvae","surface_form":"larvae","offset":712},{"uri":"Predators","surface_form":"predators","offset":741},{"uri":"Elytra","surface_form":"elytra","offset":795}]}
