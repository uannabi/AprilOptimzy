{"id":647780,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-rise_building","text":"e=\"preserve\">A high-rise building is a tall building. It is used as an apartment building, office building or other functions, such as hotel or retail. Sometimes, multiple purposes are combined. A residential high-rise building is also called a tower block or an \"MDU\", standing for \"Multi Dwelling Unit\". A very tall high-rise building is called a skyscraper.\nHigh-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the elevator (lift) and cheaper and more abundant building materials. The materials used for high-rise buildings are reinforced concrete and steel. Most North American style skyscrapers have a steel frame, while residential blocks are usually constructed of concrete. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a skyscraper but a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":44},{"uri":"Apartment","surface_form":"apartment","offset":71},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":91},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":135},{"uri":"Retail","surface_form":"retail","offset":144},{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":349},{"uri":"Elevator","surface_form":"elevator","offset":423},{"uri":"Reinforced_concrete","surface_form":"reinforced concrete","offset":536},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":560},{"uri":"North_American","surface_form":"North American","offset":572},{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":593},{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":612}]}
