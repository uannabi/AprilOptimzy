{"id":64788,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure or stress. It is a measure of perpendicular force per unit area i.e. equal to one newton per square meter. In everyday life, the pascal is maybe best known from meteorological air-pressure reports, where it happens in the form of hectopascal (1 hPa = 100 Pa). In other cases, the kilopascal is more commonly used, for example on bicycle tire labels. One hectopascal corresponds to 0.1 and one kilopascal to about 1% of atmospheric pressure (near sea level).\nIt is named after the French mathematician and physicist, Blaise Pascal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":44},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":63},{"uri":"Stress_(physics)","surface_form":"stress","offset":75},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":116},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":131},{"uri":"Newton_(unit)","surface_form":"newton","offset":154},{"uri":"Square_meter","surface_form":"square meter","offset":165},{"uri":"Atmospheric_pressure","surface_form":"atmospheric pressure","offset":491},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":552},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":559},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":577},{"uri":"Blaise_Pascal","surface_form":"Blaise Pascal","offset":588}]}
