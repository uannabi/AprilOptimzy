{"id":64792,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores","text":"The Azores () is an archipelago of nine volcanic islands in the North Atlantic Ocean; they are about west of Lisbon and about southeast of Newfoundland. The islands, and their Exclusive Economic Zone, form the Autonomous Region of the Azores, one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal.\nThere are nine major Azores islands and several very small islands (islets), in three main groups. They extend for more than and lie in a northwest-southeast direction.\nThe archipelago is part of the Macaronesia islands.\nHistory.\nOfficially, the islands were discovered in the 15th century (in 1431) by Gon\u00E7alo Velho Cabral a Captain in the service of Infante Dom Henrique, although credit is also given to the explorer Diogo de Silves (in 1427).\nThe archipelago was settled over the centuries, mostly from mainland Portugal. Portuguese settlers came from the provinces of Algarve, Minho, Alentejo and Ribatejo, as well as Madeira.\nIn 1976, the Azores became the Autonomous Region of the Azores (), an autonomous region of Portugal.\nGeography.\nThe archipelago is in the Atlantic Ocean between 36\u00BA and 43\u00BA latitude North and between 25\u00BA and 31\u00BA longitude West. They have a very humid oceanic climate with relatively small annual variations.\nThe eastern group also has, to the northeast of Santa Maria, a group of very small islands (islets) and reefs that are named \"Ilh\u00E9us das Formigas\" (Islets of the Ants), or just \"Formigas\" (\"Ants\"); these smalls islands, together with the \"Dollabarat\" reef, form the Reserva Natural do Ilh\u00E9u das Formigas.\nThe nine islands have a total area of. Their individual areas vary between of the largest island (S\u00E3o Miguel) to of the smallest (Corvo).\nAll the islands have volcanic origins, although some, such as Santa Maria, have had no recorded activity since the islands were settled. The last volcano to erupt in the archipelago was the Capelinhos Volcano () in 1957, in the western part of the island of Faial. Earthquakes are common on most of the islands.\nThe Azores are on place where three of the world's large tectonic plates (the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate) meet. The westernmost islands of the archipelago, (Corvo and Flores), are in the North American Plate, while the remaining islands are located within the region where the Eurasian plate is separated from the African Plates.\nThe volcano Mount Pico, on the Pico island, is the highest point in Portugal, at.\nClimate.\nDaily maximum temperatures usually range between and. The average annual rainfall increases from east to west, and it ranges from 700 to 1600 annual millimetres (27.6\u201363\u00A0in) on average, reaching on Mount Pico.\nThe sea around the Azores is warmed by the Gulf Stream and sea water temperature varies from to.\nHurricanes.\nA total of 11 tropical or subtropical cyclones have affected the region in history. Most of them were either extratropical or tropical storms when they impacted the region, although several hurricanes of Category 1 have reached the Azores.\nAdministration.\nWhen the Azores became an Autonomous Region of Portugal, the cities of Ponta Delgada, Angra and Horta were considered administrative cities to the regional government: homes to the President (Ponta Delgada), the Judiciary (Angra) and the Regional Assembly (Horta).\nPopulation.\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the total population in the Azores was 246,746: 121,533 men and 125,213 women. The density for the whole Archipelago is 106 persons/km2.\nEconomy.\nThe Azores economy is based mainly on agriculture, fisheries and tourism.\nIn the agriculture sector, cattle-raising is very important. Some of the most important crops in the Azores are pineapples, grapes, potatoes, tobacco and tea. Fisheries are an important economic activity on all islands. Fishing methods are highly traditional among Azorean fishermen. Industry in the Azores is based mainly on the production of dairy products (milk, cheese) and transformation of fisheries products, such as tuna.\nIt is tourism, however, that has been growing more in recent years. It is far less developed than those industries of its Macaronesian neighbours, Madeira and Canary Islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":20},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":40},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":49},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":70},{"uri":"Lisbon","surface_form":"Lisbon","offset":109},{"uri":"Newfoundland_(island)","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":139},{"uri":"Exclusive_Economic_Zone","surface_form":"Exclusive Economic Zone","offset":176},{"uri":"Autonomous_area","surface_form":"autonomous regions","offset":258},{"uri":"Islet","surface_form":"islet","offset":358},{"uri":"Macaronesia","surface_form":"Macaronesia","offset":490},{"uri":"Gon%C3%A7alo_Velho","surface_form":"Gon\u00E7alo Velho Cabral","offset":593},{"uri":"Henry_the_Navigator","surface_form":"Infante Dom Henrique","offset":642},{"uri":"Diogo_de_Silves","surface_form":"Diogo de Silves","offset":710},{"uri":"Algarve","surface_form":"Algarve","offset":863},{"uri":"Minho_Province","surface_form":"Minho","offset":872},{"uri":"Alentejo_Province","surface_form":"Alentejo","offset":879},{"uri":"Ribatejo_Province","surface_form":"Ribatejo","offset":892},{"uri":"Madeira","surface_form":"Madeira","offset":913},{"uri":"Autonomous_area","surface_form":"autonomous region","offset":992},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":1060},{"uri":"Longitude","surface_form":"longitude","offset":1134},{"uri":"Humidity","surface_form":"humid","offset":1167},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":1173},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":1181},{"uri":"Islet","surface_form":"islet","offset":1322},{"uri":"Reef","surface_form":"reef","offset":1334},{"uri":"Ilh%C3%A9us_das_Formigas","surface_form":"Ilh\u00E9us das Formigas","offset":1356},{"uri":"Islet","surface_form":"Islet","offset":1378},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"Ant","offset":1392},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"Ant","offset":1420},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic","offset":1694},{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"erupt","offset":1830},{"uri":"Earthquake","surface_form":"Earthquake","offset":1938},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"tectonic plates","offset":2042},{"uri":"North_American_Plate","surface_form":"North American Plate","offset":2063},{"uri":"Eurasian_Plate","surface_form":"Eurasian Plate","offset":2089},{"uri":"African_Plate","surface_form":"African Plate","offset":2112},{"uri":"Mount_Pico","surface_form":"Mount Pico","offset":2363},{"uri":"Mount_Pico","surface_form":"Mount Pico","offset":2640},{"uri":"Gulf_Stream","surface_form":"Gulf Stream","offset":2695},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical","offset":2775},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical cyclone","offset":2787},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":2870},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical storms","offset":2887},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":2951},{"uri":"Ponta_Delgada_(Azores)","surface_form":"Ponta Delgada","offset":3088},{"uri":"Angra_(Azores)","surface_form":"Angra","offset":3103},{"uri":"Horta_(Azores)","surface_form":"Horta","offset":3113},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"administrative cities","offset":3135},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":3508},{"uri":"Fishery","surface_form":"fisheries","offset":3521},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":3535},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":3571},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":3632},{"uri":"Pineapple","surface_form":"pineapple","offset":3656},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":3668},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":3676},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":3686},{"uri":"Tea","surface_form":"tea","offset":3698},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"Industry","offset":3828},{"uri":"Dairy","surface_form":"dairy","offset":3888},{"uri":"Milk","surface_form":"milk","offset":3904},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":3910},{"uri":"Tuna","surface_form":"tuna","offset":3968},{"uri":"Macaronesia","surface_form":"Macaronesia","offset":4096},{"uri":"Madeira","surface_form":"Madeira","offset":4121},{"uri":"Canary_Islands","surface_form":"Canary Islands","offset":4133}]}
