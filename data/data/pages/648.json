{"id":648,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace","text":"Peace is a time without any fights or wars. In a larger sense, peace (or peacefulness) can mean a state of harmony, quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all, like a still pond with no ripples.\nMany people and organizations want peace. One organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the League of Nations after World War I. When it did not stop World War II, it was replaced by the United Nations which tries to make the world peaceful. This means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first, the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first. This idea was used by the United Nations to defend both South Korea and Kuwait when they were attacked.\nMartin Luther King, Jr. wrote in a [http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html letter he sent from the Birmingham jail] that, \"True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice.\" In other words, Real peace is more than just problems being gone: there must be fairness to have peace.\nAlfred Nobel created an annual award, the Nobel Peace Prize, for the person who had done the most to bring peace to the world.\nReligious beliefs and peace.\nBuddhists think that peace can be gotten once all suffering ends.To get rid of suffering and get this peace, many try to follow a set of teachings called the Four Noble Truths\nJews and Christians believe that true peace comes from a personal relationship with God. Jesus Christ (also called the \"Prince of Peace\" in the Book of Isaiah) said: \"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.\" ()\nInner peace.\nInner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace, with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of stress. Being \"at peace\" is considered by many to be healthy and the opposite of being stressed or anxious. Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness.\nPeace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as prayer, meditation, Tai chi chuan or yoga, for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself.\nPeace movement.\nA movement that seeks to get ideals such as the ending of a particular war, minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, often linked to the goal of achieving world peace. Means to achieve these ends usually include advocacy of pacifism, non-violent resistance, conscientious objector, diplomacy, boycotts, moral purchasing, supporting anti-war political candidates, demonstrations, and lobbying to create legislation on human rights or of international law.\nTheories on peace.\nMany different theories of \"peace\" exist in the world of peace studies, which involves the study of conflict transformation. The definition of \"peace\" can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.\nPeace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fight","surface_form":"fight","offset":28},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":38},{"uri":"Pond","surface_form":"pond","offset":185},{"uri":"Organization","surface_form":"organization","offset":223},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":363},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":387},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":421},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":458},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":752},{"uri":"Kuwait","surface_form":"Kuwait","offset":768},{"uri":"Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","offset":800},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":1032},{"uri":"Alfred_Nobel","surface_form":"Alfred Nobel","offset":1146},{"uri":"Nobel_Peace_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":1188},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":1302},{"uri":"Four_Noble_Truths","surface_form":"Four Noble Truths","offset":1460},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":1478},{"uri":"Christians","surface_form":"Christians","offset":1487},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":1562},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":1567},{"uri":"Book_of_Isaiah","surface_form":"Book of Isaiah","offset":1622},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mental","offset":1863},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":1876},{"uri":"Knowledge","surface_form":"knowledge","offset":1910},{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayer","offset":2400},{"uri":"Meditation","surface_form":"meditation","offset":2408},{"uri":"Tai_chi_chuan","surface_form":"Tai chi chuan","offset":2420},{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"yoga","offset":2437},{"uri":"World_peace","surface_form":"world peace","offset":2742},{"uri":"Pacifism","surface_form":"pacifism","offset":2811},{"uri":"Nonviolence","surface_form":"non-violent resistance","offset":2821},{"uri":"Conscientious_objector","surface_form":"conscientious objector","offset":2845},{"uri":"Diplomacy","surface_form":"diplomacy","offset":2869},{"uri":"Boycott","surface_form":"boycott","offset":2880},{"uri":"Moral_purchasing","surface_form":"moral purchasing","offset":2890},{"uri":"Demonstration_(people)","surface_form":"demonstrations","offset":2950},{"uri":"Lobbying","surface_form":"lobbying","offset":2970},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":3004},{"uri":"International_law","surface_form":"international law","offset":3023},{"uri":"Peace_studies","surface_form":"peace studies","offset":3118}]}
