{"id":648080,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVARK","text":"TVARK is a British website that has thousands of videos and images from old TV shows, advertisements, idents and more, mainly from the United Kingdom. It was created on 8 November 1998 as a one man hobby when the internet was used by many from dial-up. Back then it was called \u201CTelevision Ark\u201D. Over the years it grew to include many clips from many years of British TV, as well as some other TV stations around the world. 10 volunteers have since been working for them.\nIn March of 2017, the site was taken down for repairs, and they said it would come back at the end of 2017, it turns out that the website took until the beginning of 2020 to get back online. They also have a Facebook page where they add clips from their website every day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"TV_show","surface_form":"TV show","offset":76},{"uri":"Television_advertisement","surface_form":"advertisements","offset":86},{"uri":"Station_identification","surface_form":"idents","offset":102},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":135},{"uri":"Dial-up","surface_form":"dial-up","offset":244},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":679}]}
