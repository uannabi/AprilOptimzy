{"id":64815,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_worker","text":"e=\"preserve\">Guest workers are people brought into a country to work in different industries.\nThey are used to fill a shortage in labour that most often cannot be done locally. Guest workers often do not have the same rights as normal workers. In some countries guest workers are not allowed to stay long periods of time. In Germany there are many guest workers from Turkey. Turkish guest workers have formed their own communities in the German cities where they live. Turkish guest workers have been in Germany since the 1950s.\nMany Koreans in Japan came as guest workers early in the 20th century, and in Arab countries late in the century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":325},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":367}]}
