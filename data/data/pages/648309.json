It was founded in September 1969 in Seattle, Washington. Ten years later in 1979, the first franchised Red Robin was opened in Yakima, Washington.\nThe restaurant chain is now headquartered in Greenwood Village, Colorado (a suburb of Denver). It has over 530 locations, 499 of which are company owned.\nThe original Red Robin in Seattle closed in March 2010. It was later demolished in 2014.\nRed Robin later added a \"simplified\" line of restaurants called Red Robin's Burger Works in Washington, D.C., Ohio, Illinois and Colorado. These restaurants are quick-service eateries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":77},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":100},{"uri":"Seattle","surface_form":"Seattle","offset":154},{"uri":"Yakima%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Yakima, Washington","offset":245},{"uri":"Greenwood_Village%2C_Colorado","surface_form":"Greenwood Village, Colorado","offset":310},{"uri":"Denver","surface_form":"Denver","offset":351},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":600},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":618},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":624},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":637}]}
