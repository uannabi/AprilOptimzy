As a child, he was the inspiration of the character Christopher Robin in his father's Winnie-the-Pooh stories and in two books of poems.\nMilne gave the original stuffed animals that inspired the Pooh characters to the books' editor, who in turn donated them to the New York Public Library. He hated the idea of Winnie-the-Pooh being commercialized.\nMilne died in his sleep on 20 April 1996 in Totnes, Devon, aged 75.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"A._A._Milne","surface_form":"A.
