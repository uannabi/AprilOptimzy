{"id":648357,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbinilium","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Unbinilium\" is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the periodic table. It is also known as eka- radium. The atomic number of this element is 120. It has the symbol \"Ubn\". The name Unbinilium and the symbol Ubn are temporary IUPAC names. This name and symbol exist until a permanent name is decided. It is expected to be a S-block element and an alkaline earth metal. It is the second element in the eighth period of the periodic table.\nThis element is not synthesized (obtained or discovered) yet. A German team of \"GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research\" attempted a research on 2011. It suggested a possible production of 299Ubn. But it was incomplete. Attempts were planned by Russian, Japanese, French teams. These were planned in 2017-2020. Experiments from the attempts showed that 8th period elements were difficult to synthesize. Unbinilium is expected to be the last element that can be synthesized through current technology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"IUPAC_nomenclature","surface_form":"IUPAC","offset":254},{"uri":"S-block","surface_form":"S-block element","offset":352},{"uri":"Alkaline_earth_metal","surface_form":"alkaline earth metal","offset":375},{"uri":"GSI_Helmholtz_Centre_for_Heavy_Ion_Research","surface_form":"GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research","offset":546}]}
