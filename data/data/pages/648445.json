They were doing very badly in the opinion polls against the Progressive Conservatives. Their leader was former Toronto City Councillor Doug Ford. An analysis of several polls by the CBC showed that the Progressive Conservatives had the most support out of all the parties.\nOn the day of the election, the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government and the NDP became the Official Opposition. The Liberals won only seven seats in the Legislature. This was their worst result since Confederation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_premiers_of_Ontario","surface_form":"25th","offset":79},{"uri":"Premier_of_Ontario","surface_form":"Premier of Ontario","offset":84},{"uri":"Ontario_Liberal_Party","surface_form":"Ontario Liberal Party","offset":125},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":233},{"uri":"Member_of_Provincial_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Provincial Parliament","offset":274},{"uri":"Don_Valley_West_(provincial_electoral_district)","surface_form":"Don Valley West","offset":316},{"uri":"2018_Ontario_general_election","surface_form":"2018 provincial election campaign","offset":405},{"uri":"Opinion_poll","surface_form":"opinion poll","offset":489},{"uri":"Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario","surface_form":"Progressive Conservatives","offset":515},{"uri":"Toronto_City_Council","surface_form":"Toronto City Council","offset":566},{"uri":"Doug_Ford","surface_form":"Doug Ford","offset":590},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":604},{"uri":"Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation","surface_form":"CBC","offset":637},{"uri":"Majority_government","surface_form":"majority government","offset":792},{"uri":"New_Democratic_Party_of_Ontario","surface_form":"NDP","offset":820},{"uri":"Official_Opposition_(Canada)","surface_form":"Official Opposition","offset":835},{"uri":"Canadian_Confederation","surface_form":"Confederation","offset":944}]}
