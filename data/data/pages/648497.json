{"id":648497,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Gardens_DLR_station","text":"Island Gardens is a light metro station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Bank-Lewisham Line. It is next to Island Gardens in North Greenwich, East London. It is just north of the River Thames, on the Isle of Dogs. The station is close to the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs and the River Thames.\nHistory.\nThe original Island Gardens DLR station was opened on 31 August 1987 as the southern terminus of the initial DLR system. It was built next to the site of the old North Greenwich railway station, which had been the southern terminus of the old Millwall Extension Railway. Island Gardens DLR station was elevated with two platforms.\nThe extension of the DLR to a new terminus at Lewisham passes under the River Thames in a deep tube tunnel. This required a new Island Gardens DLR station to be built, further away from the river, and underground. The original station and the southern end of the connecting viaduct have since been demolished.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metro","surface_form":"metro","offset":26},{"uri":"Docklands_Light_Railway","surface_form":"Docklands Light Railway","offset":47},{"uri":"Island_Gardens","surface_form":"Island Gardens","offset":111},{"uri":"North_Greenwich%2C_Isle_of_Dogs","surface_form":"North Greenwich","offset":129},{"uri":"East_London","surface_form":"East London","offset":146},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":183},{"uri":"Isle_of_Dogs","surface_form":"Isle of Dogs","offset":204},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":287},{"uri":"North_Greenwich_railway_station","surface_form":"North Greenwich railway station","offset":472},{"uri":"Millwall_Extension_Railway","surface_form":"Millwall Extension Railway","offset":553},{"uri":"Lewisham_station","surface_form":"Lewisham","offset":687},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":713},{"uri":"Viaduct","surface_form":"viaduct","offset":915}]}
