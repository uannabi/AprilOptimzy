It is sometimes considered a hate crime. The reason for that is such acts of violence are done against women and girls mainly because they're female.\nThe United Nations' Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women says: \"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power of relations between men and women.\"\nViolence against women has several broad categories: rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual violence and forced marriage are among those categories.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violent","offset":90},{"uri":"Hate_crime","surface_form":"hate crime","offset":164},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":289},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":531},{"uri":"Sexual_harassment","surface_form":"sexual harassment","offset":537},{"uri":"Domestic_violence","surface_form":"domestic violence","offset":556},{"uri":"Sexual_violence","surface_form":"sexual violence","offset":575},{"uri":"Forced_marriage","surface_form":"forced marriage","offset":595}]}
