{"id":648577,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzards_Bay","text":"=\"preserve\">Buzzards Bay is a bay next to the southeastern part of the U.S. State of Massachusetts. It is around 28 miles long and eight miles wide.\nBuzzards Bay is a popular place for tourism, fishing and boating.\nThe name was given to this bay by colonists who saw a large bird they called a buzzard near the shores. But it was really an osprey.\nTowns on Buzzards Bay were hit hardest by the effects of Hurricane Bob in August 1991.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Headlands_and_bays","surface_form":"bay","offset":30},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"U.S. State","offset":71},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":85},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":185},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":194},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":206},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":275},{"uri":"Buzzard","surface_form":"buzzard","offset":294},{"uri":"Osprey","surface_form":"osprey","offset":340},{"uri":"Hurricane_Bob","surface_form":"Hurricane Bob","offset":405}]}
