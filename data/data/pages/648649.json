It was originally brought from China during the J\u014Dmon period and used red rice. In modern times, it is made by steaming sticky rice and red beans. It is typically served in a bowl or in bento. Local specialty ingredients are often added to make it sweeter, such as peanuts in Chiba Prefecture, natt\u014D in Yamanashi Prefecture and Hiroshima Prefecture, and sweet beans in Nagano Prefecture.\nIn 2012, an organization was founded to promote \"sekihan\" in Japan. It has declared November 23rd each year as \"Sekihan\" Day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":128},{"uri":"J%C5%8Dmon_period","surface_form":"J\u014Dmon period","offset":145},{"uri":"Sticky_rice","surface_form":"sticky rice","offset":217},{"uri":"Red_beans","surface_form":"red beans","offset":233},{"uri":"Bento","surface_form":"bento","offset":283},{"uri":"Chiba_Prefecture","surface_form":"Chiba Prefecture","offset":373},{"uri":"Natt%C5%8D","surface_form":"natt\u014D","offset":391},{"uri":"Yamanashi_Prefecture","surface_form":"Yamanashi Prefecture","offset":400},{"uri":"Hiroshima_Prefecture","surface_form":"Hiroshima Prefecture","offset":425},{"uri":"Nagano_Prefecture","surface_form":"Nagano Prefecture","offset":466},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":546}]}
