{"id":64866,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin","text":"Gin is a type of alcoholic drink with a high amount of alcohol in it, usually about 35-50% alcohol by volume. It was invented in the Netherlands in the 17th century, and soon became very popular in England. This became a problem when many people drank themselves to death, because gin was cheap to make and contained so much alcohol.\nGin is flavored with juniper berries. Today, gin is usually a dry liquor, which means that it is not very sweet. Gin is also very popular in cocktails - two of the most common of these are the Gin & Tonic (gin mixed with tonic water) and the martini (gin mixed with vermouth, usually with an olive added). Gin is still one of the most popular liquors to this day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":17},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":133},{"uri":"Juniper","surface_form":"juniper","offset":355},{"uri":"Cocktail","surface_form":"cocktail","offset":475},{"uri":"Vermouth","surface_form":"vermouth","offset":600},{"uri":"Olive_(fruit)","surface_form":"olive","offset":626}]}
