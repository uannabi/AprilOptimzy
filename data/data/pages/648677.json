Yaki-manju is a traditional local food in Gunma. It began in the Edo period and was first made by a shop called Harashimaya in Maebashi, Gunma. Manju usually has miso paste on the outside and Azuki bean inside, which gives it a salty and sweet flavor, as well as a crispy texture on the outside and soft texture on the inside. It is sold at shops or festival<nowiki/>s. It is a cheap, large, and filling snack. Making it requires flour, sugar, yeast, lukewarm water, salad oil and salt in a bowl. The dough is kneaded and steamed. Third, they are shaped round and put on a skewer. Finally, they are baked with miso paste.\nIsesaki, Gunma holds a Yakimanju festival in January.
