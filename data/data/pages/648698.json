Instead of making a real change from ugly to pretty, he said it was more important to find an actress who could show the different changes in her personality and feelings.\nFilming took place in various places in California. The highschool scenes were shot at Torrance High School, where Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Beverly Hills, 90210 had also filmed.\nIscove was also a choreographer before he was a director and wanted to include dancing in the film.
