Sometimes his name is spelled Luis V\u00E1ez de Torres. He was born around the year 1565, and died in 1607. Today, he is noted for the first recorded European navigation of the strait which separates the continent of Australia from the island of New Guinea. The strait is now named after him (Torres Strait).\nOrigins and early life.\nCaptain Luis V\u00E1ez de Torres undertook a voyage from 1606 to 1607. In this voyage, the crew called him a \"Breton\" in reports. One of the reports points to an origin in the northwest province of Spain, that is Galicia. Historians accept this as evidence of his origins. The year and exact place of his birth are unknown but he was likely born around 1565.\nTorres has been presented as Portuguese, without any evidence other than his name. He is never called a Portuguese in the records but they note remarks made by crew members of the Portuguese origins of Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00F3s.\nTorres entered the navy of the Spanish Crown and found his way to its South American colonies. By late 1605 he first entered the historical record as the nominated commander of the second ship in an expedition to the Pacific. The Portuguese born navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00F3s proposed him for the positon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":210},{"uri":"Strait","surface_form":"strait","offset":228},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":268},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":297},{"uri":"Torres_Strait","surface_form":"Torres Strait","offset":344},{"uri":"Crew","surface_form":"crew","offset":470},{"uri":"Britonia","surface_form":"Breton","offset":489},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":577},{"uri":"Galicia%2C_Spain","surface_form":"Galicia","offset":592},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"Historian","offset":601},{"uri":"Portuguese","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":767},{"uri":"Pedro_Fernandes_de_Queir%C3%B3s","surface_form":"Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00F3s","offset":940},{"uri":"Spanish_Navy","surface_form":"navy of the Spanish Crown","offset":987},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1038},{"uri":"Nominated","surface_form":"nominated","offset":1122},{"uri":"Commander","surface_form":"commander","offset":1132},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":1185}]}
