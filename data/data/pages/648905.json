Dev rubbed sindoor on Radhika's forehead, which she had gotten on her head by accident. This caused them to get married without their knowledge. When a priest who witnessed Dev and Radhika's \"wedding\" comes to Radhika's home and tells her parents that Radhika is married, Radhika tries to tell Dev this but is unable to meet him again.\nAfter 12 years.\nOne night after college, Radhika meets Dev.

A fire starts and Rohan gets badly burned, though Radhika is saved. Dev meets Radhika in the hospital and asks her what caused the fire. She tells him that Rohan knows that she loves someone else; Dev gets angry at this and tells her he hates her. Radhika decides to get into their house as the \"choti bahu\" and wife of Dev without telling anyone so she can gain Dev's trust back.\nAfter all the misunderstandings are cleared, the family accepts Dev and Radhika's relationship and Dev and Radhika are soon to be wed. However, because of social norms, everyone calls Radhikha an unchaste woman. To end this problem, Dadaji calls off Dev's marriage with Radikha and fixes it with Barkha. On the eve of Barkha and Dev's wedding, Barkha, wishing to help Radhika, lies to Radikha that she has told Dadaji about what happened 12 years ago and Dadaji has accepted her and will let her become Dev's wife. Radhika therefore dresses up in Barkha's wedding dress and takes the wedding vows with Dev.\nAfter Dadaji realizes that Dev married Radikha instead of Barkha, he suffers a fatal heart attack. The Purohit family decides that Dev will pretend to be married to Barkha in the public eye, and Radhika will perform all of the normal tasks at home.\nRadhika obediently performs all the duties of a \"choti bahu\". Barkha puts sleeping powder in Dev's juice, causing him to become unconscious. Barkha then reveals that she loves Dev and Radhika overhears everything.

In a twist, Radhika returns after a month, but this time is different \u2014 she has become confident and fearless. This is because Kanha, the god Radhika is devoted to, has disguised himself as Radhika to put an end to Barkha's crimes, as Dev is made only for Radhika.\nThe rest of the story tells how Kanha teaches Barkha her lesson. One day, when Kanha is at home as Radhika, Dev asks her if she's alright. Radhikha asks why, and Dev tells her he saw her outside the temple begging for help.
