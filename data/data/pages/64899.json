{"id":64899,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus","text":"The Eye of Horus was an important symbol in ancient Egypt. It was the symbol of protection and Royal Power from Ra or Horus.\nHorus was an ancient Egyptian sky god in the form of a falcon. The right eye represents a peregrine falcon's eye and the markings around it. This includes the \"teardrop\" marking sometimes found below the eye. As the wadjet (also udjat or utchat), it also represented the sun, and was associated with the Sun God Ra (Re). The \"mirror image\", or left eye, represented the moon and the God Tehuti (Thoth).\nIn arithmetic.\nIn the ancient Egyptian measurement system, the Eye Of Horus defined an Old Kingdom rounded off number one(1) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64, by throwing away 1/64.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":34},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"ancient Egypt","offset":44},{"uri":"Ra","surface_form":"Ra","offset":112},{"uri":"Horus","surface_form":"Horus","offset":118},{"uri":"Horus","surface_form":"Horus","offset":125},{"uri":"Egyptian_mythology","surface_form":"ancient Egyptian","offset":138},{"uri":"Sky_god","surface_form":"sky god","offset":155},{"uri":"Falcon","surface_form":"falcon","offset":180},{"uri":"Peregrine_Falcon","surface_form":"peregrine falcon","offset":215},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":396},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":495},{"uri":"Thoth","surface_form":"Thoth","offset":520},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":558},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measurement","offset":567}]}
