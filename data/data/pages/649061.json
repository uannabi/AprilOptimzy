{"id":649061,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichodesmium","text":"\"Trichodesmium\", or \"sea sawdust\", is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria. They are found in nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical ocean waters.\nThey are most common around Australia and in the Red Sea, where they were first described by Captain Cook.\n\"Trichodesmium\" is a diazotroph; that is, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, a nutrient used by other organisms. \"Trichodesmium\" is thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":40},{"uri":"Filamentation","surface_form":"filamentous","offset":49},{"uri":"Cyanobacteria","surface_form":"cyanobacteria","offset":61},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"nutrient","offset":94},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":108},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":121},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":175},{"uri":"Red_Sea","surface_form":"Red Sea","offset":196},{"uri":"Captain_Cook","surface_form":"Captain Cook","offset":240},{"uri":"Diazotroph","surface_form":"diazotroph","offset":275},{"uri":"Nitrogen_fixation","surface_form":"fixes atmospheric nitrogen","offset":299},{"uri":"Ammonium","surface_form":"ammonium","offset":331}]}
