The killer was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved.\nThe victims usually were attacked with an axe, which often belonged to the victims themselves. In most cases, a panel on a back door of a home was removed by a chisel, which were both left on the floor near the door, followed by an attack on one or more of the residents with either an axe or straight razor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":46},{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"serial killer","offset":55},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":79},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":92},{"uri":"Axe","surface_form":"axe","offset":241},{"uri":"Chisel","surface_form":"chisel","offset":359}]}
