{"id":649390,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elisa_Lam","text":"e=\"preserve\">The body of Elisa Lam, also known by her Cantonese name, Lam Ho Yi (; April 30, 1991 \u2013 February 2013), a Canadian student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Her body was discovered from a water tank at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles on February 19, 2013. She had been reported missing at the beginning of the month.\nMaintenance workers at the hotel discovered the body when investigating guest complaints of problems with the water supply.\nThe circumstances of Lam's death, once she was found, also raised questions, especially in light of the Cecil's history in relation to other notable deaths and murders. Her body was naked with most of her clothes and personal effects floating in the water near her.\nThe autopsy showed that her death was by accident.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cantonese_language","surface_form":"Cantonese","offset":54},{"uri":"University_of_British_Columbia","surface_form":"University of British Columbia","offset":142},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":176},{"uri":"Water_tank","surface_form":"water tank","offset":218},{"uri":"Cecil_Hotel_(Los_Angeles)","surface_form":"Cecil Hotel","offset":236},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":251},{"uri":"Naked","surface_form":"naked","offset":652},{"uri":"Autopsy","surface_form":"autopsy","offset":740}]}
