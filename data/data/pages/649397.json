{"id":649397,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Brian_Wells","text":"e=\"preserve\">Brian Douglas Wells (November 15, 1956\u00A0\u2013 August 28, 2003) was an American man who died after a homemade neck-bomb exploded while being involved in a plot involving a bank robbery in Erie, Pennsylvania. Before his death, Wells was a pizza delivery man who, shortly before his death, made a delivery stop outside of Erie.\nInvestigated by a task force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it was described as \"one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI\". The Wells story was the subject of significant attention in the mass media. The question of whether Wells was a victim or a mastermind behind the robbery plot is debated.\nIn a July 2007 indictment, federal prosecutors said that Wells had been involved in the planning of the botched bank robbery. Two of his alleged co-conspirators, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes, were indicted. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin sentenced Barnes to 45 years in federal prison. Two years later, Diehl-Armstrong was also found guilty and, in 2011, was sentenced to life in prison, where she died from cancer in 2017.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":122},{"uri":"Bank_robbery","surface_form":"bank robbery","offset":179},{"uri":"Erie%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Erie, Pennsylvania","offset":195},{"uri":"Pizza","surface_form":"pizza","offset":245},{"uri":"Task_force","surface_form":"task force","offset":351},{"uri":"Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","surface_form":"Federal Bureau of Investigation","offset":373},{"uri":"Sean_J._McLaughlin","surface_form":"Sean J.
