{"id":649419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Alton_Bridge","text":"Old Alton Bridge is a historic iron through-truss bridge connecting the Texas cities of Denton and Copper Canyon. It was built in 1884.\nIt originally carried horses and later automobiles over Hickory Creek at a location that once was a popular ford for crossing cattle. The bridge takes its name from the abandoned community of Alton, which between 1850-1856 was the seat of Denton County.\nLocally, the bridge is known as \"Goatman's Bridge\", due to a legendary demonic folk legend of the same name, who is popularly believed to live in the forest surrounding the area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":50},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":72},{"uri":"Denton%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Denton","offset":88},{"uri":"Copper_Canyon%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Copper Canyon","offset":99},{"uri":"Denton_County%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Denton County","offset":375}]}
