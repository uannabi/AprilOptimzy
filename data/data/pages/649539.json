Police determined that they were poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent similar to that used in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, away, almost four months earlier. Sturgess died on 8 July, and Rowley regained consciousness two days later.\nThe origin of the poison was possibly a perfume bottle they had picked up in a park.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amesbury","surface_form":"Amesbury","offset":116},{"uri":"Novichok","surface_form":"Novichok","offset":182},{"uri":"Nerve_agent","surface_form":"nerve agent","offset":191},{"uri":"Sergei_Skripal","surface_form":"Sergei Skripal","offset":244},{"uri":"Salisbury","surface_form":"Salisbury","offset":285}]}
