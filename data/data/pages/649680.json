The office holds executive powers within each borough, and the five borough presidents also sat on the New York City Board of Estimate. Since 1990, the borough presidents have been stripped of a majority of their powers in the government of New York City.\nBorough presidents advise the mayor, comment on land-use items in their borough, advocate borough needs in the annual municipal budget process, appoint some officials and community board members, and serve \"ex officio\" as members of many boards and committees.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Boroughs_of_New_York_City","surface_form":"boroughs of New York City","offset":51},{"uri":"New_York_City_Board_of_Estimate","surface_form":"New York City Board of Estimate","offset":181},{"uri":"Government_of_New_York_City","surface_form":"government","offset":305}]}
