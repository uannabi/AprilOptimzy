{"id":649683,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City","text":"New York City is made up of five county-level sections called \"boroughs\": Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. All boroughs are part of New York City. Queens is the largest borough.\nBoroughs have existed since the official creation of the city in 1898, when the city and each borough assumed their current boundaries. However, the boroughs have not always been part with their respective counties. Before 1914, the borough of The Bronx had been earlier in the southern part of Westchester County which had then been annexed to New York County. Before 1899, the County of Queens included an eastern part, which was split off during the formation to become Nassau County.\nEach borough is represented by a Borough president.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":0},{"uri":"County_(United_States)","surface_form":"county","offset":33},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":63},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":74},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":85},{"uri":"Queens","surface_form":"Queens","offset":95},{"uri":"The_Bronx","surface_form":"The Bronx","offset":103},{"uri":"Staten_Island","surface_form":"Staten Island","offset":118},{"uri":"Westchester_County%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Westchester County","offset":499},{"uri":"New_York_County","surface_form":"New York County","offset":549},{"uri":"Nassau_County%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Nassau County","offset":677},{"uri":"Borough_president","surface_form":"Borough president","offset":725}]}
