{"id":649805,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Vehicles","text":"Bedford Vehicles, usually shortened to just Bedford, was a brand of vehicle produced by Vauxhall Motors. It was ultimately owned by General Motors (GM). The brand was established in 1930 and built commercial vehicles. Bedford Vehicles was a leading international lorry brand. It had substantial export sales of light, medium, and heavy lorries throughout the world. It was GM Europe's most profitable venture for several years.\nBedford's core heavy trucks business was sold off as AWD Ltd in 1987 but the Bedford brand continued to be used on light commercial vehicles and car-derived vans based on Vauxhall/Opel, Isuzu and Suzuki designs. The brand was retired in 1991. After this, GM Europe's light commercial vehicles were branded as either Vauxhall or Opel, depending on the market.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vauxhall_Motors","surface_form":"Vauxhall Motors","offset":88},{"uri":"General_Motors","surface_form":"General Motors","offset":132},{"uri":"Commercial_vehicle","surface_form":"commercial vehicle","offset":197},{"uri":"Lorry","surface_form":"lorry","offset":263},{"uri":"GM_Europe","surface_form":"GM Europe","offset":373},{"uri":"AWD_Trucks","surface_form":"AWD Ltd","offset":481},{"uri":"Opel","surface_form":"Opel","offset":608},{"uri":"Isuzu","surface_form":"Isuzu","offset":614},{"uri":"Suzuki","surface_form":"Suzuki","offset":624}]}
