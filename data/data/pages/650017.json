{"id":650017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexane","text":"Hexane is an organic compound with the chemical formula. It is an alkane with 6 carbon atoms. \"Hexane\" can mean any of the 5 structural isomers (meaning compounds with the same chemical formula but a different shape) it has. IUPAC naming says that \"hexane\" only means the isomer with no branches, with the other 4 having different names.\nThere is a lot of hexene in gasoline. Pure hexane has no color and is quite unreactive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":13},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":39},{"uri":"Alkane","surface_form":"alkane","offset":66},{"uri":"Structural_isomers","surface_form":"structural isomers","offset":125},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":210},{"uri":"IUPAC","surface_form":"IUPAC","offset":225},{"uri":"Gasoline","surface_form":"gasoline","offset":366},{"uri":"Pure","surface_form":"Pure","offset":376},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":395},{"uri":"Reactivity","surface_form":"unreactive","offset":414}]}
