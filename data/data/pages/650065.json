{"id":650065,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_West_Rail","text":"East West Rail is a major project to \"establish a strategic railway connecting East Anglia with Central, Southern and Western England\".\nIn particular, it plans to build (or rebuild) a new line linking Oxford and Cambridge via Bicester, Milton Keynes (at Bletchley) and Bedford. It will largely use existing (but closed) railway lines. It will provides a route between any or all of the Great Western, Chiltern, West Coast, Midland, East Coast, West Anglia and Great Eastern main lines, avoiding London. The new line will provide a route for potential new services between and Ipswich or Norwich via, Didcot and Ely, using existing onward lines. The western section from Oxford to Bedford was approved by the Government in November 2011, with completion of this section expected by 2025.\n, the segment from Oxford via Bicester Village to the junction with the Chiltern Main Line is operational. Electrification of the line is not planned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"East_Anglia","surface_form":"East Anglia","offset":79},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":201},{"uri":"Cambridge","surface_form":"Cambridge","offset":212},{"uri":"Bicester","surface_form":"Bicester","offset":226},{"uri":"Milton_Keynes","surface_form":"Milton Keynes","offset":236},{"uri":"Bletchley","surface_form":"Bletchley","offset":254},{"uri":"Bedford","surface_form":"Bedford","offset":269},{"uri":"Great_Western_Main_Line","surface_form":"Great Western","offset":386},{"uri":"Chiltern_Main_Line","surface_form":"Chiltern","offset":401},{"uri":"West_Coast_Main_Line","surface_form":"West Coast","offset":411},{"uri":"Midland_Main_Line","surface_form":"Midland","offset":423},{"uri":"East_Coast_Main_Line","surface_form":"East Coast","offset":432},{"uri":"West_Anglia_Main_Line","surface_form":"West Anglia","offset":444},{"uri":"Great_Eastern_Main_Line","surface_form":"Great Eastern","offset":460},{"uri":"Ipswich","surface_form":"Ipswich","offset":576},{"uri":"Norwich","surface_form":"Norwich","offset":587},{"uri":"Didcot","surface_form":"Didcot","offset":600},{"uri":"Ely%2C_Cambridgeshire","surface_form":"Ely","offset":611},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":670},{"uri":"Bedford","surface_form":"Bedford","offset":680},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":806},{"uri":"Bicester_Village","surface_form":"Bicester Village","offset":817},{"uri":"Chiltern_Main_Line","surface_form":"Chiltern Main Line","offset":859},{"uri":"Railway_electrification_system","surface_form":"Electrification","offset":894}]}
