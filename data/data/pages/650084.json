He was the Archbishop of Washington D.C. from 2001 to 2006, and was promoted to cardinalate in 2001. From 1986 to 2000, he was the Archdoicese of Newark.\nMcCarrick was born in New York City. He studied in Switzerland before transferring to Fordham University.\nIn June 2018, McCarrick was removed from the public ministry by Pope Francis after it was discovered that McCarrick sexually abused a 16 year old boy in New York years ago. A few days later, three more men accused McCarrick of sexual abuse. A month later, another man from New Jersey accused McCarrick of sexual abuse.\nOn July 27, 2018, Pope Francis ordered McCarrick to observe \"a life of prayer\" and accepted his resignation from the College of Cardinals. McCarrick became the first person to resign from the College of Cardinals since 1927 and the first cardinal to resign following allegations of sexual abuse.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":58},{"uri":"Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)","surface_form":"cardinal","offset":89},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":105},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Washington","surface_form":"Archbishop","offset":139},{"uri":"Washington_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington D.C.","offset":153},{"uri":"Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)","surface_form":"cardinalate","offset":208},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Newark","surface_form":"Archdoicese","offset":259},{"uri":"Newark%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Newark","offset":274},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":304},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":333},{"uri":"Fordham_University","surface_form":"Fordham University","offset":368},{"uri":"Pope_Francis","surface_form":"Pope Francis","offset":452},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":541},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":661},{"uri":"Pope_Francis","surface_form":"Pope Francis","offset":725},{"uri":"College_of_Cardinals","surface_form":"College of Cardinals","offset":824}]}
