{"id":65081,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina%2C_Saskatchewan","text":"Regina is the capital and second largest city of Saskatchewan, Canada. It is in the eastern prairie region of Western Canada. It is nicknamed \"The Queen City\" because it was named after Queen Victoria, i.e. Victoria Regina, in 1882, by her daughter Princess Louise, who was the wife of the then-Governor General the Marquess of Lorne.\nRegina was also previously the seat of government for the North-West Territories, which were once formed part of today's Saskatchewan and Alberta provinces, and also of the District of Assiniboia. Regina is expected to enter a new period of strong economic growth due to Saskatchewan's agricultural and mineral resources coming into new demand.\nThe Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League are the only professional sports team in Regina. They play their home games in Regina at Mosaic Stadium. Regina also has the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League and the University of Regina's Regina Cougars/Regina Rams of the CIS.\nRegina Stations\nCKCK CTV Television Network\nCFRE Global Television Network\nSaskatchewan Communications Network","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saskatchewan","surface_form":"Saskatchewan","offset":49},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":63},{"uri":"Prairie","surface_form":"prairie","offset":92},{"uri":"Western_Canada","surface_form":"Western Canada","offset":110},{"uri":"Princess_Louise","surface_form":"Princess Louise","offset":249},{"uri":"Marquess_of_Lorne","surface_form":"Marquess of Lorne","offset":316},{"uri":"North-West_Territories","surface_form":"North-West Territories","offset":393},{"uri":"Saskatchewan_Roughriders","surface_form":"Saskatchewan Roughriders","offset":684},{"uri":"Canadian_Football_League","surface_form":"Canadian Football League","offset":716},{"uri":"Mosaic_Stadium","surface_form":"Mosaic Stadium","offset":830},{"uri":"Regina_Pats","surface_form":"Regina Pats","offset":866},{"uri":"Western_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Western Hockey League","offset":885},{"uri":"University_of_Regina","surface_form":"University of Regina","offset":915},{"uri":"Canadian_Interuniversity_Sport","surface_form":"CIS","offset":972},{"uri":"Regina_Stations","surface_form":"Regina Stations","offset":977},{"uri":"CKCK","surface_form":"CKCK","offset":993},{"uri":"CTV_Television_Network","surface_form":"CTV Television Network","offset":998},{"uri":"CFRE","surface_form":"CFRE","offset":1021},{"uri":"Global_Television_Network","surface_form":"Global Television Network","offset":1026},{"uri":"Saskatchewan_Communications_Network","surface_form":"Saskatchewan Communications Network","offset":1052}]}
