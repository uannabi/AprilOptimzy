{"id":65097,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless","text":"The word wireless is used to refer to any type of electrical or electronic operation which is done without a \"hard wired\" connection. Wireless communication is the transfer of information over a distance without the use of wires. The distances involved may be short (when using a television remote control) or very long (thousands or even millions of kilometers for radio communications).\nUses.\nOne of the most popular wireless technology is the mobile phone, with more than 6.8 billion subscriptions worldwide as of 2013. The term wireless technology is generally used for mobile information technology (IT) equipment. Examples include mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), Global Positioning System (GPS) units, garage door openers, wireless computer mice and keyboards, satellite television and cordless telephones.\nHistory.\nThe world's first wireless telephone conversation happened in 1880, when Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter invented photophone, a telephone that made conversations wirelessly using light beams. In 1946, a driver in Saint Louis, Mo. placed the first cell phone call in history. The cell phone was invented by Bell Labs and future AT&T CEO, H.I Romnes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electrical","offset":50},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":64},{"uri":"Wire","surface_form":"wire","offset":223},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":446},{"uri":"Information_technology","surface_form":"information technology","offset":581},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":637},{"uri":"Personal_Digital_Assistant","surface_form":"personal digital assistants","offset":652},{"uri":"Global_Positioning_System","surface_form":"Global Positioning System","offset":688},{"uri":"Computer_mouse","surface_form":"computer mice","offset":757},{"uri":"Keyboard_(computer)","surface_form":"keyboards","offset":775},{"uri":"Satellite_television","surface_form":"satellite television","offset":786},{"uri":"Telephone","surface_form":"telephone","offset":820},{"uri":"Alexander_Graham_Bell","surface_form":"Alexander Graham Bell","offset":914},{"uri":"Photophone","surface_form":"photophone","offset":972},{"uri":"Cell_phone","surface_form":"cell phone","offset":1105},{"uri":"Bell_Labs","surface_form":"Bell Labs","offset":1164},{"uri":"AT%26amp%3BT","surface_form":"AT&T","offset":1185}]}
