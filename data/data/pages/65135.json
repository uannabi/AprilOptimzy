{"id":65135,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27izzi","text":"e=\"preserve\">Amir Abdollah Muhammad Mu'izzi (1048-1125) was an 11th century and 12th century poet. He was from Persia, and was the poet laureate of Sanjar. He was from the village of Nisa. He is considered one of the great masters of the Persian panegyric qasideh.\nHe lived in the courts of Malik Shah I and Sultan Sanjar. His \"divan\" of 18,000 distichs remain. Anvari says Mu'izzi copied the verses of other poets (this cannot be proven for certain). Anvari himself is known to have copied Mu'izzi's verses. Mu'izzi is said to have died by an arrow shot by the King's son in 1125 for unknown reasons. He was accidentally shot by Sanjar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1048-1125","surface_form":"1048-1125","offset":45},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th century","offset":63},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":80},{"uri":"Persia","surface_form":"Persia","offset":111},{"uri":"Poet_laureate","surface_form":"poet laureate","offset":131},{"uri":"Sanjar","surface_form":"Sanjar","offset":148},{"uri":"Nisa_(village)","surface_form":"Nisa","offset":183},{"uri":"Panegyric","surface_form":"panegyric","offset":246},{"uri":"Qasideh","surface_form":"qasideh","offset":256},{"uri":"Malik_Shah_I","surface_form":"Malik Shah I","offset":291},{"uri":"Sultan_Sanjar","surface_form":"Sultan Sanjar","offset":308},{"uri":"Distich","surface_form":"distich","offset":345},{"uri":"Anvari","surface_form":"Anvari","offset":362},{"uri":"1125","surface_form":"1125","offset":576},{"uri":"Sanjar","surface_form":"Sanjar","offset":630}]}
