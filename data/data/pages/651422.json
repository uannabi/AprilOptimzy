{"id":651422,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Garner","text":"Alan Garner OBE (born 17 October 1934) is an English author who writes children's fantasy novels.\nEarly life.\nGarner was born in Congleton in the front room of his grandfather's house. He grew up in a town called Alderley Edge. His family told stories about the local area involving kings, knights and wizards. He played with his friends in the cliffs and forests around the town. He later used these experiences to give him ideas for his books. In 1953 he went to Oxford University but left after a few years because he wanted to concentrate on writing.\nWriting career.\nGarner worked as a labourer until his first book The Weirdstone of Brisingamen was published in 1960. It is set in the Alderley Edge mines and the story is about wizards and knights underground, just like in the stories Garner's family would tell. After the book was published, Garner gave up his job and started working as a television reporter instead. He made very little money. At this time, he started to work on a second book called The Moon of Gomrath. In 1965, Elidor was published, telling the story of four children who enter a fantasy world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_British_Empire","surface_form":"OBE","offset":12},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":45},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":53},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novels","offset":90},{"uri":"Congleton","surface_form":"Congleton","offset":129},{"uri":"Alderley_Edge","surface_form":"Alderley Edge","offset":213},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford University","offset":465},{"uri":"The_Weirdstone_of_Brisingamen","surface_form":"The Weirdstone of Brisingamen","offset":620},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"reporter","offset":908},{"uri":"The_Moon_of_Gomrath","surface_form":"The Moon of Gomrath","offset":1010},{"uri":"Elidor","surface_form":"Elidor","offset":1040}]}
