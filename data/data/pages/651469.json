{"id":651469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox","text":"Sorites paradox (also called Paradox of the heap) is a paradox that arises when unclear terms are used. The name of the paradox is related to the Greek word for \"heap\" ('soros'). There are different versions, but a typical one involves a heap of sand. The heap is made of many grains of sand. So if one grain is removed, the structure will still be a heap. This process can be repeated, until only one grain of sand is left. Since the heap never changed to a non-heap, this grain of sand is still a heap.\nThe paradox works the other way as well. If one begins with one grain of sand and adds another, and then another; when do the grains of sand become a heap?","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paradox","surface_form":"paradox","offset":55}]}
