{"id":651815,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Warren","text":"Dr. Joseph Warren (June 11, 1741 - June 17, 1775) was an American physician and fighter in the American Revolutionary War. He played a leading role in American Patriot groups in Boston in the early days of the American Revolution.\nWarren enlisted Paul Revere and William Dawes on April 18, 1775. They were to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British were about to raid Concord, Massachusetts and arrest rebel leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock.\nWarren was appointed Major General in the Massachusetts colony's militia just before the June 17, 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. But instead of exercising his rank, Warren served in the battle as a private soldier. He was killed in combat when British troops attacked Breed's Hill.\nMany United States cities and towns are named for Warren.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":66},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":95},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":178},{"uri":"Paul_Revere","surface_form":"Paul Revere","offset":247},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":352},{"uri":"Concord%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Concord, Massachusetts","offset":379},{"uri":"Samuel_Adams","surface_form":"Samuel Adams","offset":427},{"uri":"John_Hancock","surface_form":"John Hancock","offset":444},{"uri":"Major_general","surface_form":"Major General","offset":479},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":500},{"uri":"Battle_of_Bunker_Hill","surface_form":"Battle of Bunker Hill","offset":561},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":661},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":742},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":756},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":767}]}
