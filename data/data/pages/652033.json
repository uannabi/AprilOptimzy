The band was formed in 1995 by Eminem, Proof, Bizarre, D.Ratt, Bflat, Mr. Porter,and Eye Kyu in Detroit, Michigan.\nThe band gained significant notoriety thanks to Eminem's international success. Taking advantage of this success, they have managed to rank their albums at the top of sales in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Their two studio albums, \"Devil's Night\" and \"D12 World\", released in 2001 and 2004 respectively, features singles like \"Fight Music\", \"Purple Pills\", \"My Band\", \"Shit on You\", and \"How Come\". Since 2006 and the death of Proof, the group has remained almost inactive because of Eminem's drug problems.which led to its withdrawal from the music scene for more than three years and the departure of Mr. Porter and Bizarre in 2012. However, the band reformed several times in 2014, only for Eminem to announce their department on \"Stepping Stone\" from \"Kamikaze\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":80},{"uri":"Hip_hop","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":89},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"group","offset":97},{"uri":"Eminem","surface_form":"Eminem","offset":135},{"uri":"Proof_(rapper)","surface_form":"Proof","offset":143},{"uri":"Bizarre_(rapper)","surface_form":"Bizarre","offset":150},{"uri":"Mr._Porter","surface_form":"Mr. Porter","offset":174},{"uri":"Eye_Kyu","surface_form":"Eye Kyu","offset":189},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit, Michigan","offset":200},{"uri":"Eminem","surface_form":"Eminem","offset":267},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":425},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":447},{"uri":"Devil%27s_Night_(album)","surface_form":"Devil's Night","offset":489},{"uri":"D12_World","surface_form":"D12 World","offset":509},{"uri":"Fight_Music","surface_form":"Fight Music","offset":584},{"uri":"Purple_Pills","surface_form":"Purple Pills","offset":599},{"uri":"My_Band","surface_form":"My Band","offset":615},{"uri":"Shit_on_You","surface_form":"Shit on You","offset":626},{"uri":"How_Come","surface_form":"How Come","offset":645},{"uri":"Proof_(rapper)","surface_form":"Proof","offset":684},{"uri":"Eminem","surface_form":"Eminem","offset":741},{"uri":"Mr._Porter","surface_form":"Mr. Porter","offset":860},{"uri":"Bizarre_(rapper)","surface_form":"Bizarre","offset":875},{"uri":"Kamikaze_(Eminem_album)","surface_form":"Kamikaze","offset":1013}]}
