Food crops usually get iodine from the soil, but some places around the world have low amounts of iodine. Iodized salt is a very cheap and good way of getting the necessary iodine.\nOrdinary table (cooking) salt is a chemical compound called \"sodium chloride\" (its chemical formula is NaCl). \"Sodium iodide\" (NaI) is added to the NaCl to make iodized salt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sodium_chloride","surface_form":"table salt","offset":46},{"uri":"Iodide","surface_form":"iodide","offset":84},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":114},{"uri":"Thyroid","surface_form":"thyroid","offset":129},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":216},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":250},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":427},{"uri":"Sodium_chloride","surface_form":"sodium chloride","offset":453},{"uri":"Iodine","surface_form":"iodide","offset":510}]}
