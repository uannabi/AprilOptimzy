The male equivalent of cameltoe is \"mooseknuckle\". It is called a \"camel toe\" because of how the woman's labia outline is similar to that of a camel's toe.\nCamel toe happens as a result of wearing tight-fitting clothes, such as shorts, leggings or swimwear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":40},{"uri":"Labia_majora","surface_form":"labia majora","offset":80},{"uri":"Camel","surface_form":"camel","offset":272},{"uri":"Shorts","surface_form":"shorts","offset":357}]}
