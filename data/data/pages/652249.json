{"id":652249,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Parker","text":"Eugene Newman Parker (born June 10, 1927) is an American solar astrophysicist. In the mid-1950s\u2014developed the theory of the supersonic solar wind and predicted the Parker spiral shape of the solar magnetic field in the outer solar system.\nIn 1987, Parker proposed that the solar corona might be heated by myriad tiny \"nanoflares\" (similar to solar flares) that would happen all over the surface of the Sun.\nParker spent four years at the University of Utah and has been at the University of Chicago since 1955. Parker was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1967.\nIn 2017, NASA renamed its \"Solar Probe Plus\" to \"Parker Solar Probe\" in his honor, marking the first time NASA had named a spacecraft after a living person.\nIn 2018, the American Physical Society awarded him the Medal for Exceptional Achievement in Research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astrophysicist","surface_form":"astrophysicist","offset":63},{"uri":"Solar_wind","surface_form":"solar wind","offset":135},{"uri":"Parker_spiral","surface_form":"Parker spiral","offset":164},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":225},{"uri":"Corona","surface_form":"solar corona","offset":273},{"uri":"Solar_flares","surface_form":"solar flares","offset":342},{"uri":"University_of_Utah","surface_form":"University of Utah","offset":438},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":477},{"uri":"United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":537},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":584},{"uri":"Parker_Solar_Probe","surface_form":"Parker Solar Probe","offset":624},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":681}]}
