{"id":652257,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan","text":"The Upper Peninsula (UP), also known as Upper Michigan, is the northern of the two major peninsulas that make up the U.S. state of Michigan. The peninsula is north by Lake Superior, on the east by the St. Marys River, on the southeast by Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and on the southwest by Wisconsin.\nThe Upper Peninsula has 29% of the land area of Michigan but just 3% of its total population. Residents are frequently called \"Yoopers\".\nThe peninsula's largest cities are Marquette, Sault Ste. Marie, Escanaba, Menominee, Houghton, and Iron Mountain.\nMaple syrup is a highly prized local delicacy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peninsulas","surface_form":"peninsulas","offset":89},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":131},{"uri":"Lake_Superior","surface_form":"Lake Superior","offset":167},{"uri":"St._Marys_River_(Michigan-Ontario)","surface_form":"St. Marys River","offset":201},{"uri":"Lake_Michigan","surface_form":"Lake Michigan","offset":238},{"uri":"Lake_Huron","surface_form":"Lake Huron","offset":256},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":292},{"uri":"Yooper_dialect","surface_form":"Yoopers","offset":430},{"uri":"Marquette%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Marquette","offset":475},{"uri":"Sault_Ste._Marie%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Sault Ste.
