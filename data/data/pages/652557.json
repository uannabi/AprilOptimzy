{"id":652557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globish","text":"Globish is an attempt at creating a subset of the English language for use as the international language for commerce. It has 1500 words, simple grammar rules, no humor, and no Anglo-cultural references. It was inspired by Charles Kay Ogden's BE 850. It has a word base based on real observation of non-natives' conversations in English.\nThe selection of 1500 words is slightly different from the VOA Special English and the SPOTLIGHT Specialized English word choices, but still quite similar. There is however a different list from a Japanese website on Globish. And the Globish Text Scanner allows some 500 more words.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Charles_Kay_Ogden","surface_form":"Charles Kay Ogden","offset":223},{"uri":"BE_850","surface_form":"BE 850","offset":243},{"uri":"Special_English","surface_form":"Special English","offset":401}]}
