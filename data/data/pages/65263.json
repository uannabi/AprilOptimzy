{"id":65263,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCchner_flask","text":"A B\u00FCchner flask (also called a vacuum flask, a filter flask, a side-arm flask or a kitasato flask) is a flask made of glass.\nStructure.\nA B\u00FCchner flask has thick walls so that a pressure change will not break it. It has a hole in the top where a B\u00FCchner funnel can be put and a small tube in the side where a vacuum can be attached. The small tube has barbs on it so that the vacuum will not weaken.\nUses.\nA B\u00FCchner flask can be used with a B\u00FCchner funnel for separating solids and liquids. Water is poured into the B\u00FCchner funnel and the liquid passes through filter paper and is sucked up by a vacuum attached to the side of the B\u00FCchner flask, while the solid stays behind in the B\u00FCchner funnel.\nThe B\u00FCchner flask can also be used as a vacuum trap in a vacuum line to ensure that no fluids are carried over from the aspirator or vacuum pump (or other vacuum source) to the evacuated apparatus, or vice versa.\nHistory.\nIt is commonly thought to be named after the Nobel Laureate, Eduard Buchner, but it is actually named after the industrial chemist Ernst B\u00FCchner.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"B%C3%BCchner_funnel","surface_form":"B\u00FCchner funnel","offset":246},{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":309},{"uri":"B%C3%BCchner_funnel","surface_form":"B\u00FCchner funnel","offset":441}]}
