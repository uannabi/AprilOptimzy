With the right knife, the cuts you want to make will happen faster and more easily. With the wrong kind of knife, it will take more effort to perform the same amount of work. When a knife is too small to cut something, a saw, axe, or power tool may be needed.\nIllegal knives.\nCarrying knives is illegal in many countries, especially if the blade is longer than several inches. Another type of knife which is illegal in many places is the \"switchblade,\" a knife that has a button which when pressed activates a spring to open the knife.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saw","surface_form":"saw","offset":449},{"uri":"Axe","surface_form":"axe","offset":454},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":523}]}
