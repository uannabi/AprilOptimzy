{"id":653489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Landmark","text":"Chicago Landmark is a designation of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States.\nSites are selected after meeting many criteria, such as historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social importance. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it is subject to the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations must be done with a permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission.\nMany Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks having more Federal protection.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mayor_of_Chicago","surface_form":"Mayor of Chicago","offset":41},{"uri":"Chicago_City_Council","surface_form":"Chicago City Council","offset":66},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":129},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":138},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":148},{"uri":"Historical","surface_form":"historical","offset":219},{"uri":"Economic","surface_form":"economic","offset":231},{"uri":"Architectural","surface_form":"architectural","offset":241},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":256},{"uri":"Cultural","surface_form":"cultural","offset":266},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":280},{"uri":"Construction_permit","surface_form":"permit","offset":446},{"uri":"Commission_on_Chicago_Landmarks","surface_form":"Landmarks Commission","offset":469},{"uri":"National_Register_of_Historic_Places","surface_form":"National Register of Historic Places","offset":537},{"uri":"National_Historic_Landmark","surface_form":"National Historic Landmark","offset":655}]}
