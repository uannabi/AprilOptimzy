He died in Turin on 4 July 1925 from polio, aged 24.\nHis cause for canonization opened in 1932 after the Turin poor made several pleas for such a cause to open. However, Pope Pius XII suspended the cause in 1941. Pope John Paul II beatified Frassati in mid-1990 and dubbed him the \"Man of the Eight Beatitudes\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beatification","surface_form":"Blessed","offset":0},{"uri":"Italian_people","surface_form":"Italian","offset":66},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":74},{"uri":"Social_activist","surface_form":"social activist","offset":89},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":121},{"uri":"Third_Order_of_Saint_Dominic","surface_form":"Third Order of Saint Dominic","offset":153},{"uri":"Social_justice","surface_form":"social justice","offset":203},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":290},{"uri":"Polio","surface_form":"polio","offset":334},{"uri":"Canonization","surface_form":"canonization","offset":364},{"uri":"Pope_Pius_XII","surface_form":"Pope Pius XII","offset":467},{"uri":"Pope_John_Paul_II","surface_form":"Pope John Paul II","offset":510}]}
