He created over 300 movies from 1946 through 2019. He was Jewish and many of his relatives were killed by Nazis in the 1940s.\nBrauner produced \"Sag' die Wahrheit\", one of the first movies produced in Germany after World War II. He also produced \"Morituri\", but received negative reviews and failed at the box office. He began to work with German Hollywood-based producers such as Robert Siodmak and later Fritz Lang who started a revival of Dr. Mabuse.\nSome of his movies dealt with the Holocaust such as \"Die Wei\u00DFe Rose\", \"The Plot to Assassinate Hitler\" (\"Der 20. Juli\") and \"Man and Beast\" (\"Mensch und Bestie\").\nBrauner died on 7 July 2019 in Berlin at the age of 100.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":189},{"uri":"Nazis","surface_form":"Nazis","offset":237},{"uri":"Sag%27_die_Wahrheit","surface_form":"Sag' die Wahrheit","offset":275},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":345},{"uri":"Morituri_(1948_movie)","surface_form":"Morituri","offset":377},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":477},{"uri":"Robert_Siodmak","surface_form":"Robert Siodmak","offset":511},{"uri":"Fritz_Lang","surface_form":"Fritz Lang","offset":536},{"uri":"Dr._Mabuse","surface_form":"Dr. Mabuse","offset":572},{"uri":"Holocaust","surface_form":"Holocaust","offset":618},{"uri":"Die_Wei%C3%9Fe_Rose_(movie)","surface_form":"Die Wei\u00DFe Rose","offset":637},{"uri":"The_Plot_to_Assassinate_Hitler","surface_form":"The Plot to Assassinate Hitler","offset":655},{"uri":"Man_and_Beast","surface_form":"Man and Beast","offset":709},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":778}]}
