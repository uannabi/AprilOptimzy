{"id":653902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Knoll","text":"e=\"preserve\">Florence Marguerite Knoll Bassett (n\u00E9e Schust; May 24, 1917 \u2013 January 25, 2019) was an American architect and furniture designer who studied under Mies van der Rohe and Eliel Saarinen. She was born Florence Schust in Saginaw, Michigan, and was known in familiar circles as \"Shu\".\nKnoll felt architects should contribute their design ability to furniture as well. Some of these furniture designs would become design icons of the 20th century and have remained in the Knoll line for decades due to their timeless design.\nKnoll's most famous creations are the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company Headquarters building in Bloomfield, Connecticut and the interior of the CBS Building in New York City.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mies_van_der_Rohe","surface_form":"Mies van der Rohe","offset":160},{"uri":"Eliel_Saarinen","surface_form":"Eliel Saarinen","offset":182},{"uri":"Saginaw%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Saginaw, Michigan","offset":230},{"uri":"Architects","surface_form":"architects","offset":304},{"uri":"Connecticut_General_Life_Insurance_Company_Headquarters","surface_form":"Connecticut General Life Insurance Company Headquarters","offset":570},{"uri":"Bloomfield%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Bloomfield, Connecticut","offset":638},{"uri":"CBS_Building","surface_form":"CBS Building","offset":686},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":702}]}
