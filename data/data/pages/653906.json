Mayhew is one of the only four living knights of the very exclusive Military William Order, the highest honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nIn 1939 Mayhew was an officer of the 1st Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment. He commanded a company which landed in Normandy in 1944 and fought in the North West Europe Campaign. Mayhew was injured while fighting in the Netherlands.\nIn 1946 Mayhew was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, receiving the Knight fourth class of the Military William Order. The chapter of the order lost contact with him in the 1980s until he was seen wearing his medal at a memorial service in 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":56},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":80},{"uri":"Military_William_Order","surface_form":"Military William Order","offset":162},{"uri":"Dutch_honours_system","surface_form":"honour","offset":198},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Kingdom of the Netherlands","offset":212},{"uri":"Suffolk_Regiment","surface_form":"Suffolk Regiment","offset":298},{"uri":"Normandy_landings","surface_form":"landed in Normandy","offset":345},{"uri":"North_West_Europe_Campaign","surface_form":"North West Europe Campaign","offset":390},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":459},{"uri":"Knighthood","surface_form":"knighted","offset":491},{"uri":"Wilhelmina_of_the_Netherlands","surface_form":"Wilhelmina of the Netherlands","offset":509}]}
