{"id":653958,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid","text":"Kool-Aid is an American brand of flavored drink mix. The product is owned by Kraft Foods.\nHistory.\nKool-Aid was invented by Edwin Perkins in Hastings, Nebraska. Before Kool-Aid, there was a liquid drink called Fruit Smack. To cut down shipping costs, Perkins found a way to remove the liquid from Fruit Smack and leave only a powder. The powder was called \"Kool-Aid\".\nPerkins moved his production to Chicago in 1931. Kool-Aid was sold to General Foods in 1953.\nKool-Aid is usually sold in powder form, in packets and small tubs. The actual beverage is made by mixing the substance with water and sugar. But there are some sugar-free varieties. The drink is usually served with ice or refrigerated and then served chilled.\nThe Kool-Aid Man is associated with Kool-Aid. He was created in the 1950s. He was made over in 2013.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":15},{"uri":"Kraft_Foods","surface_form":"Kraft Foods","offset":77},{"uri":"Hastings%2C_Nebraska","surface_form":"Hastings, Nebraska","offset":141},{"uri":"Powder","surface_form":"powder","offset":326},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":400},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":586},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":596},{"uri":"Refrigeration","surface_form":"refrigerated","offset":684}]}
