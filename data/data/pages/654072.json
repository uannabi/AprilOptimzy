A body matching her description was found in a cornfield on August 21 in Poweshiek County, Iowa, which was later identified as hers.\nAccording to police, her last confirmed communication was with her boyfriend of three years, Dalton Jack, who was out of town for work in Dubuque, Iowa, over away, shortly before leaving for her jog.\nThe Iowa State Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy on the body and recorded the cause of death as \"multiple sharp force injuries\" and the manner as homicide.\nMexican-born Cristhian Bahena Rivera faces first-degree murder charges. His lawful immigration status is disputed.\nVice President Mike Pence called attention to the case at the beginning of a speech in Des Moines on August 15, telling a crowd of President Donald Trump's supporters that the government would continue to provide \"any and all federal support\" to the case. Pence later met with the Tibbetts family aboard Air Force Two.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brooklyn%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"Brooklyn, Iowa","offset":101},{"uri":"Cornfield","surface_form":"cornfield","offset":164},{"uri":"Poweshiek_County%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"Poweshiek County, Iowa","offset":190},{"uri":"Dubuque%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"Dubuque, Iowa","offset":388},{"uri":"Mike_Pence","surface_form":"Mike Pence","offset":740},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":866},{"uri":"Air_Force_Two","surface_form":"Air Force Two","offset":1029}]}
