{"id":65419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin","text":"Walden Robert Cassotto (May 14, 1936 \u2013 December 20, 1973), better known as Bobby Darin, was an American pop singer, most famous during the 1950s. His hits included \"Mack the Knife\", \"Dream Lover\", \"If I Were a Carpenter\", \"Splish Splash\", and \"Beyond the Sea\". He also helped Wayne Newton begin his musical career.\nAllen Klein, an accountant who became an artist manager, first came to public attention when he audited Darin's royalty payments, and discovered Darin had been underpaid. His record company paid up, and Darin split the money with Klein.\nDarin was married to actress Sandra Dee from 1960 to 1967. They had a son, named Dodd. Darin died late in 1973 after heart surgery.\nIn 2004, a movie, \"Beyond the Sea\", was made about Darin's life and career. Actor Kevin Spacey, a longtime Darin fan, produced and starred in the movie, with Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":95},{"uri":"Popular_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":104},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":108},{"uri":"Wayne_Newton","surface_form":"Wayne Newton","offset":276},{"uri":"Allen_Klein","surface_form":"Allen Klein","offset":315},{"uri":"Accounting","surface_form":"accountant","offset":331},{"uri":"Manager","surface_form":"manager","offset":363},{"uri":"Audit","surface_form":"audit","offset":411},{"uri":"Royalty_payment","surface_form":"royalty payment","offset":427},{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record company","offset":490},{"uri":"Actress","surface_form":"actress","offset":573},{"uri":"Sandra_Dee","surface_form":"Sandra Dee","offset":581},{"uri":"Kevin_Spacey","surface_form":"Kevin Spacey","offset":766},{"uri":"Kate_Bosworth","surface_form":"Kate Bosworth","offset":842}]}
