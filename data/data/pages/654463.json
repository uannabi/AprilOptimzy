{"id":654463,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Frontier","text":"\"Wild Frontier\" is the sixth solo studio album by Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1987. His first studio effort after a trip back to his native Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1985. The album contains several songs about Ireland and even the music itself is steeped in Celtic roots. The album is dedicated to the memory of Moore's close friend and former Thin Lizzy bandmate Phil Lynott, who died on 4 January 1986, with the words \"For Philip\" on the rear cover.\n\"Wild Frontier\" contains the hit single \"Over the Hills and Far Away\", which reached No. 20 in the UK, as well as a cover of the Easybeats' song \"Friday on My Mind\". The Max Middleton-penned \"The Loner\" which was originally recorded by Cozy Powell for his \"Over the Top\" album in 1979 (on which Moore performed, but not on Powell's recording of \"The Loner\"). The track was substantially altered by Moore for his own recording, that is why he is credited as a co-writer.\nAll drums on \"Wild Frontier\" are sequenced with a drum machine, although the programming is uncredited in the liner notes of the album. Future Toto drummer Simon Phillips would appear on the music video for \"Over the Hills and Far Away,\" as well in early promotions for the album. He would be replaced by former Black Sabbath drummer Eric Singer for the tour, before leaving shortly afterwards to form Badlands.\n\"Over the Hills and Far Away\" was covered by the Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish on their 2001 EP of the same title, and by Swedish viking metal band Thyrfing on their album \"Urkraft\". The Spanish band Saurom also recorded a cover of this song with alternative lyrics, titled \"La Disoluci\u00F3n de la Comunidad\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":34},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":50},{"uri":"List_of_guitarists","surface_form":"guitarist","offset":56},{"uri":"Gary_Moore","surface_form":"Gary Moore","offset":66},{"uri":"Belfast","surface_form":"Belfast","offset":152},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":161},{"uri":"Celtic_music","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":274},{"uri":"Thin_Lizzy","surface_form":"Thin Lizzy","offset":360},{"uri":"Phil_Lynott","surface_form":"Phil Lynott","offset":380},{"uri":"The_Easybeats","surface_form":"Easybeats","offset":597},{"uri":"Friday_on_My_Mind","surface_form":"Friday on My Mind","offset":614},{"uri":"Max_Middleton","surface_form":"Max Middleton","offset":638},{"uri":"Cozy_Powell","surface_form":"Cozy Powell","offset":704},{"uri":"Over_the_Top_(Cozy_Powell_album)","surface_form":"Over the Top","offset":725},{"uri":"Drum_machine","surface_form":"drum machine","offset":988},{"uri":"Toto","surface_form":"Toto","offset":1081},{"uri":"Simon_Phillips_(drummer)","surface_form":"Simon Phillips","offset":1094},{"uri":"Black_Sabbath","surface_form":"Black Sabbath","offset":1250},{"uri":"Eric_Singer","surface_form":"Eric Singer","offset":1272},{"uri":"Badlands_(American_band)","surface_form":"Badlands","offset":1340},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finnish","offset":1399},{"uri":"Symphonic_metal","surface_form":"symphonic power metal","offset":1407},{"uri":"Nightwish","surface_form":"Nightwish","offset":1434},{"uri":"Over_the_Hills_and_Far_Away_(album)","surface_form":"EP of the same title","offset":1458},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":1487},{"uri":"Viking_metal","surface_form":"viking metal","offset":1495},{"uri":"Thyrfing","surface_form":"Thyrfing","offset":1513},{"uri":"Urkraft","surface_form":"Urkraft","offset":1538},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":1552},{"uri":"Saurom","surface_form":"Saurom","offset":1565}]}
