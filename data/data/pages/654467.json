{"id":654467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)","text":"=\"preserve\">The Social Democratic Party (also known as the SDP) was a centrist political party that was made by Labour Party politicians in 1981 who did not like how left-wing the party was becoming. The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party moderates, dubbed the \"Gang of Four\": Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams.\nThey allied with the Liberals, winning 25% of the vote in 1983 and 23% in 1987. The alliance between the SDP and the Liberals was called the \"SDP-Liberal Alliance\". The SDP and Liberals merged in 1988 to form the Liberal Democrats.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Centre","surface_form":"centrist","offset":70},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":112},{"uri":"Left-wing_politics","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":166},{"uri":"Roy_Jenkins","surface_form":"Roy Jenkins","offset":303},{"uri":"David_Owen","surface_form":"David Owen","offset":316},{"uri":"Bill_Rodgers","surface_form":"Bill Rodgers","offset":328},{"uri":"Shirley_Williams","surface_form":"Shirley Williams","offset":345},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Liberals","offset":384},{"uri":"SDP-Liberal_Alliance","surface_form":"SDP-Liberal Alliance","offset":505},{"uri":"Liberal_Democrats","surface_form":"Liberal Democrats","offset":576}]}
