It had bony plates on its back and head, many sharp spikes along its back and tail and four large spikes jutting out from its shoulders on each side. To protect itself from predators, it may have crouched down on the ground to protect its defenceless underbelly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Armour","surface_form":"armour","offset":18},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":27},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":69},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":89}]}
