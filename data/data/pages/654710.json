Although Nigar Jamal represented Azerbaijan, she lives in Enfield, North London.\nEurovision win.\nIn the 2011 Eurovision song contest Eldar Gasimov and Nigar Jamal performed together under the duo name Ell & Nikki. As the contest was taking place in a Western European country, the name change was made to prevent confusion of Jamal's first name being interpreted as a racial slur. Their entry, named \"Running Scared\", was written by Stefan \u00D6rn and Sandra Bjurman from Sweden and Iain Farquharson from the UK. The performance included four backing vocalists and singers, including Jessica Marberger and Vera Prada who had earlier in the year attempted to represent Sweden as part of Shirley's Angels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijani","offset":49},{"uri":"Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011","surface_form":"Eurovision Song Contest 2011","offset":150},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":183},{"uri":"North_London","surface_form":"North London","offset":348}]}
