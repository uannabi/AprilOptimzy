{"id":654835,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassoulet","text":"Cassoulet is a casserole made particularly in the south of France. It is called after its traditional cooking vessel, the \"cassole\", a deep, round, earthenware pot with slanting sides. The name comes from the Occitan \"ca\u00E7olet\" (or \"cassolet).\" It contains meat (usually pork sausages, goose, duck and sometimes mutton), pork skin (\"couennes\") and white beans (haricots blancs). It may be baked with an open or a closed top.\nThe homeland of cassoulet is the province of Languedoc, especially the towns of Toulouse, Carcassonne, and Castelnaudary. The brotherhood of Cassoulet \"La Grande Confr\u00E9rie du Cassoulet de Castelnaudary\" organizes competitions and fairs about Cassoulet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Casserole","surface_form":"casserole","offset":15},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":59},{"uri":"Earthenware","surface_form":"earthenware","offset":148},{"uri":"Occitan_language","surface_form":"Occitan","offset":209},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":270},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"sausage","offset":275},{"uri":"Goose","surface_form":"goose","offset":285},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":292},{"uri":"Lamb_and_mutton","surface_form":"mutton","offset":311},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":320},{"uri":"Languedoc","surface_form":"Languedoc","offset":469},{"uri":"Toulouse","surface_form":"Toulouse","offset":504},{"uri":"Carcassonne","surface_form":"Carcassonne","offset":514},{"uri":"Castelnaudary","surface_form":"Castelnaudary","offset":531}]}
