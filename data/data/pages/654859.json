{"id":654859,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaxxed","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe\" is a 2016 American movie pretending that there was a cover-up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a possible link between the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and autism.\nPeople were scared that vaccines might cause autism after an English doctor called Andrew Wakefield wrote a scientific article that said that they did. It was a fraud. When the General Medical Council found out, they took away his licence to be a doctor. The Vaxxed film was made by Andrew Wakefield.\nScientists have looked carefully at the MMR vaccine and found that it does not cause autism.\nAccording to \"Variety magazine\", the film \"purports to investigate the claims of a senior scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who revealed that the CDC had allegedly manipulated and destroyed data on an important study about autism and the MMR vaccine\". This did not happen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","surface_form":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","offset":121},{"uri":"Measles","surface_form":"measles","offset":206},{"uri":"Mumps","surface_form":"mumps","offset":215},{"uri":"Rubella","surface_form":"rubella","offset":225},{"uri":"Vaccine","surface_form":"vaccine","offset":234},{"uri":"Autism","surface_form":"autism","offset":246},{"uri":"Andrew_Wakefield","surface_form":"Andrew Wakefield","offset":337},{"uri":"General_Medical_Council","surface_form":"General Medical Council","offset":431},{"uri":"Variety_(magazine)","surface_form":"\"Variety magazine\"","offset":661}]}
