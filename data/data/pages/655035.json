{"id":655035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry","text":"e=\"preserve\">A public inquiry (or tribunal of inquiry) is an official review ordered by a government body.\nIt is used in many common law countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Canada. The idea is also used in many other countries, perhaps not with the same title. It is an expression of democracy, that in some cases people and groups should be able to have their voice heard directly. The issues at stake may be of a local kind, or special to a particular group of people.\nA public inquiry differs from a Royal Commission. A public inquiry accepts evidence, conducts its hearings in public and deals with a specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may make oral or written submissions, and listen to oral evidence given by other parties.\nResearch on the effects of public inquiries suggests they may not do much to change people's minds. However, it is normal for a public enquiry to be about some controversy. That is the point of the exercise.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Review","surface_form":"review","offset":70},{"uri":"Common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":126},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":160},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":176},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":185},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":199},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":310},{"uri":"Royal_Commission","surface_form":"Royal Commission","offset":529},{"uri":"Evidence","surface_form":"evidence","offset":572},{"uri":"Speech","surface_form":"oral","offset":712}]}
