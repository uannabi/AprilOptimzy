The Venn diagram is one of many ways to represent logical relationships. It is well-known because it is easy to understand, and is used in elementary set theory, probability, logic, statistics, competition math, and computer science.\nIn 1883, Venn was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1884, he was awarded a Sc.D. by Cambridge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":11},{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Society_of_Antiquaries_of_London","surface_form":"FSA","offset":16},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":59},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":67},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":80},{"uri":"Venn_diagram","surface_form":"Venn diagram","offset":111},{"uri":"Set_theory","surface_form":"set theory","offset":275},{"uri":"Probability","surface_form":"probability","offset":287},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":307},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":341},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":401},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Science","surface_form":"Sc.D.","offset":442}]}
