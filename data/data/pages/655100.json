In 2008, The speedway was sold to Bruton Smith, hoping that the track could hold a race by 2011 and after four years, the former speedway owners abandoned the lawsuit. In August 2010, NASCAR announced that the track could hold a Cup Series event in 2011. Seven months later, Royal Dutch Shell's Quaker State brand was announced to sponsor the 267-lap race held on July 9, 2011, and was won by Kyle Busch. The race was plagued by a massive traffic problem where many of the fans were expected to attend the race were turned away after several hours on Interstate 71. Following the problem, Kentucky Speedway announced that they bought more land for parking and began to work with the state government to improve the track around the speedway in time for the 2012 race.\nNew aero package for 2015.\nOn June 16, 2015, NASCAR announced a new aero package would be used for the 2015 race. The changes include a smaller rear spoiler and other adjustments that significantly reduced aerodynamic downforce. The spoiler was decreased to tall, There was also a wide splitter extension. In addition, Tires supplied to Goodyear provided drivers with more grip. \"We want to see more load changes on the racetrack\", NASCAR Executive Vice-President and Chief Racing Development Officer Steve O'Donnell said in a media teleconference, \"We will evaluate and a number of factors coming out of Kentucky, and see what we can learn and implement down the road\". Originally, the package was to be used at last year's All Star Race, but the plan was scrubbed and NASCAR opted to use the package for a points race. \"Let me be clear. This is not a test, this is a race\" O'Donnell said of the rules package will be in effect for the 18th round of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. \"We had an extensive testing plan with this industry over the past 18 months. We couldn't implement this if we didn't feel confident as an industry to implement it at Kentucky.\nTrophy.\nSince 2015, the race trophy has been in the form of a Crosley jukebox.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monster_Energy_NASCAR_Cup_Series","surface_form":"Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series","offset":95},{"uri":"Stock_car_racing","surface_form":"race","offset":128},{"uri":"Kentucky_Speedway","surface_form":"Kentucky Speedway","offset":141},{"uri":"Sparta%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Sparta, Kentucky","offset":162},{"uri":"NASCAR_Xfinity_Series","surface_form":"NASCAR Xfinity Series","offset":264},{"uri":"Camping_World_Truck_Series","surface_form":"Camping World Truck Series","offset":294},{"uri":"Kyle_Busch","surface_form":"Kyle Busch","offset":382},{"uri":"Coke_Zero_Sugar_400","surface_form":"Coke Zero Sugar 400","offset":447},{"uri":"Daytona_International_Speedway","surface_form":"Daytona International Speedway","offset":470},{"uri":"Independence_Day_(United_States)","surface_form":"Independence Day","offset":504},{"uri":"Foxwoods_Resort_Casino_301","surface_form":"Foxwoods Resort Casino 301","offset":676},{"uri":"New_Hampshire_Motor_Speedway","surface_form":"New Hampshire Motor Speedway","offset":706},{"uri":"Martin_Truex_Jr.","surface_form":"Martin Truex Jr.","offset":777},{"uri":"Kentucky_Speedway","surface_form":"Kentucky Speedway","offset":871},{"uri":"NASCAR","surface_form":"NASCAR","offset":897},{"uri":"Ollen_Bruton_Smith","surface_form":"Bruton Smith","offset":983},{"uri":"NASCAR","surface_form":"NASCAR","offset":1133},{"uri":"Royal_Dutch_Shell","surface_form":"Royal Dutch Shell","offset":1224},{"uri":"Kyle_Busch","surface_form":"Kyle Busch","offset":1342},{"uri":"Interstate_71","surface_form":"Interstate 71","offset":1500},{"uri":"Kentucky_Speedway","surface_form":"Kentucky Speedway","offset":1538},{"uri":"NASCAR","surface_form":"NASCAR","offset":1762},{"uri":"Monster_Energy_NASCAR_All_Star_Race","surface_form":"All Star Race","offset":2442},{"uri":"Monster_Energy_NASCAR_Cup_Series","surface_form":"2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series","offset":2672},{"uri":"Crosley_jukebox","surface_form":"Crosley jukebox","offset":2942}]}
