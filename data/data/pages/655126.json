He is the co-creator of UNIX operating system.\nEducation.\nThompson received a Bachelor of Science (1965) and Master's degree (1966) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of California, Berkeley.\nIn 1969, Thompson and colleague Dennis Ritchie created the UNIX operating system at Bell Telephone Laboratories. UNIX was a scaled-down version of the Multics operating system, one meant to run on the new smaller minicomputers becoming available at the end of the 1960s. When re-written in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie, UNIX became a truly portable operating system capable of running on many different hardware platforms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":54},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":67},{"uri":"UNIX","surface_form":"UNIX","offset":137},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Science","surface_form":"Bachelor of Science","offset":191},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"Master's degree","offset":222},{"uri":"Computer_engineering","surface_form":"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science","offset":248},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":297},{"uri":"Dennis_Ritchie","surface_form":"Dennis Ritchie","offset":365},{"uri":"Multics","surface_form":"Multics","offset":484}]}
