Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neurons","surface_form":"neurons","offset":70},{"uri":"Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","surface_form":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","offset":151},{"uri":"Parkinson%27s_disease","surface_form":"Parkinson's disease","offset":182},{"uri":"Alzheimer%27s_disease","surface_form":"Alzheimer's disease","offset":203},{"uri":"Huntington%27s_disease","surface_form":"Huntington's disease","offset":228},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":437},{"uri":"Neuron","surface_form":"neuron","offset":546},{"uri":"Molecular","surface_form":"molecular","offset":578}]}
