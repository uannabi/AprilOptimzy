He was the leader of the Haqqani network, a fighting group in guerilla warfare against US-led NATO forces.\nBy 2004, he was directing pro-Taliban militants to launch a holy war in Afghanistan. Within Pakistan, Jalaluddin had a relation with Pakistan but he did not act against the TTP. He was the most experienced Islamist leader in the region. Steve Coll, author of \"Ghost Wars\", claims that Haqqani introduced suicide bombing in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\nOn 3 September 2018, the Taliban released a statement via Twitter saying that Haqqani died from a terminal illness in his late 70s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mawlawi_(Islamic_title)","surface_form":"Mawlawi","offset":13},{"uri":"Haqqani_network","surface_form":"Haqqani network","offset":115},{"uri":"Guerilla_warfare","surface_form":"guerilla warfare","offset":152},{"uri":"United_States_armed_forces","surface_form":"US","offset":177},{"uri":"International_Security_Assistance_Force","surface_form":"NATO forces","offset":184},{"uri":"Taliban","surface_form":"Taliban","offset":227},{"uri":"Holy_war","surface_form":"holy war","offset":257},{"uri":"Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan","surface_form":"TTP","offset":370},{"uri":"Steve_Coll","surface_form":"Steve Coll","offset":434},{"uri":"Ghost_Wars","surface_form":"Ghost Wars","offset":457},{"uri":"Suicide_bombing","surface_form":"suicide bombing","offset":501},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":611}]}
