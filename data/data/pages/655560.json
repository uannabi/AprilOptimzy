{"id":655560,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine","text":"=\"preserve\">In computer programming, a subroutine is a code that is comprised of more codes \u2014 just like everything in programming \u2014 it's purpose is the same: execute an instruction/command. Because subroutines are shorter, they can be typed faster and therefore be used more by programmers, hence saving time by being able to code faster.\nSubroutines are commonly paired with parameter, a type of variable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"computer programming","offset":15},{"uri":"Code","surface_form":"code","offset":55},{"uri":"Parameter_(computer_science)","surface_form":"parameter","offset":376},{"uri":"Variable","surface_form":"variable","offset":397}]}
