{"id":655589,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_writing","text":"e=\"preserve\">Business writing is a form of professional communication that typically consists of memorandums, emails, letters, and other documents. Usually found within a work environment, business writing helps employees communicate efficiently. Business writing is also used for communication with outside sources such as other companies or customers. The goal of business writing is to clearly define to your audience what you are trying to portray.\nBased on what kind of audience you are writing to, (boss, coworkers, customers, other companies) certain formats will be expected. Your audience also dictates the content of the document and its tone. In most cases, a professional tone is expected although in some instances, such as with coworkers a more casual tone can be used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Communication","surface_form":"communication","offset":56},{"uri":"Email","surface_form":"email","offset":110},{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"document","offset":137}]}
