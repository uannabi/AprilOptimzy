Migrate the project to our infrastructure.\nThese action items have to be checked for during the whole incubation process.\nThese items are not to be signed as done during incubation, as they may change during incubation. They are to be looked into and described in the status reports and completed in the request for incubation signoff.\nCollaborative Development.\nHave all of the active long-term volunteers been identified and acknowledged as committers on the project?\nAre there three or more independent committers? (The legal definition of independent is long and boring, but basically it means that there is no binding relationship between the individuals, such as a shared employer, that is capable of overriding their free will as individuals, directly or indirectly.)\nAre project decisions being made in public by the committers?\nAre the decision-making guidelines published and agreed to by all of the committers?\nAre all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and acknowledged by all committers?\nThings to check for before voting the project out.\nOrganizational acceptance of responsibility for the project\nIf graduating to an existing PMC, has the PMC voted to accept it?\nIf graduating to a new PMC, has the board voted to accept it?\nHas the Incubator decided that the project has accomplished all of the above tasks?","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
