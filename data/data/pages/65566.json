{"id":65566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River","text":"The Colorado River is a river in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is approximately 1,450\u00A0miles (2,330\u00A0km) long. It drains a part of the dry regions on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains.\nThe natural course of the river flows into the Gulf of California. The heavy use of the river as an irrigation source for the Imperial Valley has desiccated the lower course of the river in Mexico. Now it no longer always reaches the sea.\nOn its way the Colorado River runs through Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, California and Mexico. The Colorado River drains 242,900 sq mi (629,100\u00A0km\u00B2). Total flows of the river range from 4000 cubic feet per second (570 m\u00B3/s) in droughts to 1,000,000\u00A0ft\u00B3/s (28,000 m\u00B3/s) in severe floods. With the construction of massive power dams on the lower course of the river, floods of over 70,000\u00A0ft\u00B3/s (2000 m\u00B3/s) are rare. The mean flow of the total river before diversion is 22,000\u00A0ft\u00B3/s.\nHistorically, the flow was much higher before water usage began in the basin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":24},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":50},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":81},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":202},{"uri":"Gulf_of_California","surface_form":"Gulf of California","offset":266},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigation","offset":319},{"uri":"Imperial_Valley","surface_form":"Imperial Valley","offset":345},{"uri":"Desiccation","surface_form":"desiccated","offset":365},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":501},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":511},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":517},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":526},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":534},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":689}]}
