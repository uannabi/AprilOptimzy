{"id":655696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affricate","text":"e=\"preserve\">Affricates are consonants that are said with a stop with a fricative immediately afterwards. For example, the 'ch' sound in English (written as /t\u0361\u0283/ in IPA) is said with an 't' (/t/) sound with an 'sh' (/\u0283/) sound immediately afterwards. Both voiced and voiceless affricates exist; in English, they are /d\u0361\u0292/ (the 'j' sound) and t\u0361\u0283 (the 'ch' sound) respectively.\nIn Mandarin Chinese, affricates are told apart by aspiration, or breathiness, since voiced affricates do not exist; aspirated affricates, or breathy affricates, are /t\u0361\u0255\u02B0/ (written as 'q' in Hanyu Pinyin), /t\u0361s\u02B0/ ('c'), and /\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02B0/ ('ch'), and unaspirated affricates, or non-breathy affricates, are /t\u0361\u0255/ ('j'), /t\u0361s/ ('z'), and /\u0288\u0361\u0282/ ('zh').","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":28},{"uri":"Stop_consonant","surface_form":"stop","offset":60},{"uri":"Fricative_consonant","surface_form":"fricative","offset":72},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":137},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"IPA","offset":166},{"uri":"Voiced_consonant","surface_form":"voiced","offset":257},{"uri":"Mandarin_Chinese","surface_form":"Mandarin Chinese","offset":381},{"uri":"Aspiration","surface_form":"aspiration","offset":428},{"uri":"Aspiration","surface_form":"aspirated","offset":494},{"uri":"Pinyin","surface_form":"Hanyu Pinyin","offset":569}]}
