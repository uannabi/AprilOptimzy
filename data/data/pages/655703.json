{"id":655703,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Higher_Education_Entrance_Examination","text":"e=\"preserve\">The National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or the Gaokao, is the People's Republic of China's national-level university entrance exam. All high school students in China must take the Gaokao in their last year of school, and much of their time in high school is spent preparing to take the exam. Like many other Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and India, the Gaokao has been well-known internationally for being a very difficult exam because many students do not get a high enough score to attend university in China.\nThe required subjects are mathematics, Chinese and English, and the full score of each three subjects is 150 points. For the remaining subjects, there are two choices: the liberal arts comprehensive are history, geography and politics, with a score of 100 for each subject; The science subjects include physics, chemistry and biology, with 100 points for each subject. Students are allowed to choose between science and liberal arts based on their level of study, and each student scored a maximum of 750. Although two kinds of choice means brought the power that examinee learns, but in China, the obtain employment of liberal arts living is more difficult than science living, the score of the university entrance exam also is lower than science living, so the examinee that chooses science department is much more than the examinee that chooses liberal arts.\nIn the national college entrance examination in June 2018, 9.75 million people took the exam, which shows the great pressure of competition. It is a pity that many people are ruined on their way to university just because of one failure in the exam. One of the disadvantages of Chinese education is that it only takes one exam to select talents. However, because there are too many references, the nation can only select talents through examinations. Facts have proved that this selection method still has some merits.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China's","offset":87},{"uri":"University_entrance_exam","surface_form":"university entrance exam","offset":131},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":161},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asian","offset":333},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":339},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":531}]}
