It was established at the end of 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust. These organizations gave the money for the journal's business and publishing operations.\nThe editor-in-chief is Randy Schekman (University of California, Berkeley). Editorial decisions are made largely by senior editors and members of the board of reviewing editors, all of whom are active scientists working in fields ranging from human genetics and neuroscience to biophysics and epidemiology.\nBusiness model.\nThe journal charges authors USD$2,500 for their papers to be published in the journal. It started doing this in 2017.\nAbstracting and indexing.\nThe journal is indexed in Medline, BIOSIS Previews, Chemical Abstracts Service, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Scopus.\nIn 2016, the journal had an impact factor of 7.725. The journal claims that it will not advertise its impact factor.\neLife digests.\nMost articles in the journal have an \"eLife digest\". This is a short version of the article for people who aren't scientists. Since December 2014, the journal has been sharing some of the digests on Medium.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scientific_journal","surface_form":"scientific journal","offset":13},{"uri":"Biomedicine","surface_form":"biomedical","offset":40},{"uri":"Life_sciences","surface_form":"life sciences","offset":55},{"uri":"Peer-reviewed","surface_form":"peer-reviewed","offset":76},{"uri":"Open_access","surface_form":"open access","offset":94},{"uri":"Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute","surface_form":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute","offset":152},{"uri":"Max_Planck_Society","surface_form":"Max Planck Society","offset":185},{"uri":"Wellcome_Trust","surface_form":"Wellcome Trust","offset":209},{"uri":"Editor-in-chief","surface_form":"editor-in-chief","offset":318},{"uri":"Randy_Schekman","surface_form":"Randy Schekman","offset":337},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":353},{"uri":"Human_genetics","surface_form":"human genetics","offset":557},{"uri":"Neuroscience","surface_form":"neuroscience","offset":576},{"uri":"Biophysics","surface_form":"biophysics","offset":592},{"uri":"Epidemiology","surface_form":"epidemiology","offset":607},{"uri":"Index_(publishing)","surface_form":"index","offset":796},{"uri":"Medline","surface_form":"Medline","offset":807},{"uri":"BIOSIS_Previews","surface_form":"BIOSIS Previews","offset":816},{"uri":"Chemical_Abstracts_Service","surface_form":"Chemical Abstracts Service","offset":833},{"uri":"Science_Citation_Index_Expanded","surface_form":"Science Citation Index Expanded","offset":861},{"uri":"Scopus","surface_form":"Scopus","offset":898},{"uri":"Impact_factor","surface_form":"impact factor","offset":934},{"uri":"Medium_(service)","surface_form":"Medium","offset":1237}]}
