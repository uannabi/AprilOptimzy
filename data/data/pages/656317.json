{"id":656317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Florence","text":"Hurricane Florence was a major tropical cyclone, powerful and Cape Verde hurricane in the Atlantic that caused severe and extensive damage in the Carolinas in September 2018. The storm threatened the East Coast of the United States with major and catastrophic flooding, especially in the Carolinas. The sixth named storm, the third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Florence first came off from Africa as a tropical wave on August 30, 2018.\nOn August 31, the tropical wave became a tropical depression. It became Tropical Storm Florence on September 1, 2018.\nThe storm strengthened to a major hurricane on September 5, and then strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane with estimated maximum sustained winds of 130 mph later that day.\nThe state Governors of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia declared a state of emergency for each state. It was becoming evident that the hurricane might strike South or North Carolina as a major hurricane.\nFlorence later weakened to a strong tropical storm. However, the storm later strengthened back to a hurricane. This time, it strengthened to 140 miles per hour, stronger than it was before.\nOn September 10, 2018, mandatory evacuations were issued in certain parts of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.\nOn September 11, 2018, tropical cyclone watches were posted for the North and South Carolina coastlines.\nThe storm made a slow landfall (7 km/h) on September 14 as a Category 1 hurricane. It had heavy rain. It took energy and water from the warm Gulf Stream near the coast for one day. When the storm was inland, it weakened to a tropical depression.\nFlorence had a wind speed of 140 mph and a central pressure of 939 millibars, but from post-analysis it had a wind speed of 150 mph.\nDamage from Florence was estimated at $24 billion (2018 USD). There were 53 deaths from Florence.\nRetirement.\nOn March 20, 2019, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name \"Florence\" due to severe and very expensive damage it caused along its track, particularly in the Carolinas, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with \"Francine\" for the 2024 season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":31},{"uri":"2018","surface_form":"2018","offset":169},{"uri":"East_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"East Coast of the United States","offset":200},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":441},{"uri":"Tropical_wave","surface_form":"tropical wave","offset":453},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"Governors","offset":789},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":802},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":818},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":837},{"uri":"State_of_emergency","surface_form":"state of emergency","offset":857},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":1296},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North","offset":1374},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":1384},{"uri":"Gulf_Stream","surface_form":"Gulf Stream","offset":1552},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"USD","offset":1846},{"uri":"World_Meteorological_Organization","surface_form":"World Meteorological Organization","offset":1923}]}
