He was a student of John Macquarrie and Ronald Gregor Smith.\nHe was a Professor of Philosophy at Randolph Macon College between 1964 and 1970. He was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of South Carolina between 1970 and 2002. During that time he was Chair of the Department of Philosophy (1972-1987).

He served as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion (1990-2010) and the Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion.\nThe major focus of Long\u2019s work is the dialogue between philosophy and theology and he is often characterized both as a philosophical theologian and philosopher of religion. Attracted in his early days to the work of Hegel and British and American Idealism, he is influenced in particular by the work of Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, Paul Tillich and John Macquarrie. Appealing to the theories of experience in the tradition of so-called radical empiricism, Long argues for transcendent dimensions of general human experience to bridge the gap between specifically religious and ordinary experience.\nLong died on March 13, 2020 at the age of 84.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Richmond%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Richmond, Virginia","offset":53},{"uri":"Randolph-Macon_College","surface_form":"Randolph-Macon College","offset":486},{"uri":"Duke_University","surface_form":"Duke University","offset":527},{"uri":"University_of_Glasgow%2C_Scotland","surface_form":"University of Glasgow, Scotland","offset":556},{"uri":"John_Macquarrie","surface_form":"John Macquarrie","offset":616},{"uri":"Ronald_Gregor_Smith","surface_form":"Ronald Gregor Smith","offset":636}]}
