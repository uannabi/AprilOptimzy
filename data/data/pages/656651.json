It struck near Morehead City having winds of 65 miles per hour.\nIn North Carolina, Doria dumped five inches of rain. There was localized flooding and minor wind damage.\nIn Virginia, the storm's rain bands caused an F1 tornado near Portsmouth, Norfolk and Chesapeake. Damage from the tornado was near $250,000. Twelve homes were damaged.\nDoria later struck the Mid-Atlantic states, New York City and west-central New England.\nTotal damage from Doria was $147.6 million.
