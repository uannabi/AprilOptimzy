It opened in July 1981 as the Vista International Hotel and was located at 3 World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York City, with the World Trade Center complex.\nThe hotel was destroyed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, after the collapse of the Twin Towers. The hotel was not replaced as part of the new World Trade Center complex, but will rather share its name with the new office tower.\nThe Vista International was the first hotel to open in Lower Manhattan since 1836. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["hotel"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":60},{"uri":"3_World_Trade_Center","surface_form":"3 World Trade Center","offset":166},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":190},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":201},{"uri":"World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)","surface_form":"World Trade Center complex","offset":225},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":296},{"uri":"September_11_attacks","surface_form":"September 11, 2001","offset":317},{"uri":"3_World_Trade_Center","surface_form":"new office tower","offset":490},{"uri":"Lower_Manhattan","surface_form":"Lower Manhattan","offset":563},{"uri":"Skidmore%2C_Owings_%26amp%3B_Merrill","surface_form":"Skidmore, Owings & Merrill","offset":620}]}
