He is known for his work on\u00A0statistical physics, including the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena.\nAcademic background.\nMichael E. Fisher studied science at\u00A0King's College London in 1951, and a PhD in physics in 1957. He began teaching at the college in 1958 and became a full professor in 1965. In 1966 he moved to Cornell University as professor of chemistry, physics, and mathematics.\u00A0In 1971, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1983, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, chemistry section. Since 1987 he has been at the Institute for Physical Science and Technology, at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences.\nFisher currently lives in Maryland with his wife Sorrel. They have four children. Two of them are also theoretical physicists: Daniel S. Fisher is professor of Applied Physics at Stanford, while Matthew P. A. Fisher is professor of Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":59},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":70},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":82},{"uri":"Statistical_physics","surface_form":"statistical physics","offset":125},{"uri":"Phase_change","surface_form":"phase transitions","offset":170},{"uri":"Critical_phenomena","surface_form":"critical phenomena","offset":192},{"uri":"King%27s_College_London","surface_form":"King's College London","offset":270},{"uri":"PhD","surface_form":"PhD","offset":307},{"uri":"Cornell_University","surface_form":"Cornell University","offset":429},{"uri":"The_Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":536},{"uri":"National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":591},{"uri":"Stanford_University","surface_form":"Stanford","offset":983},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Santa_Barbara","surface_form":"University of California, Santa Barbara","offset":1051}]}
