{"id":657136,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Statistical physics is a branch of physics. It uses probability theory, statistics, and mathematical tools to solve certain physical problems. It can describe fields where objects or events seem to be random. It can be used for problems in physics, biology, chemistry, neurology, and even some social sciences, such as sociology.\nIts main purpose is to explain the properties of matter in total, by physical laws governing atomic motion. It was first used in physics to study how particles or objects moved when subjected to a force.\nExamples of its use include explaining and quantitatively describing superconductivity, superfluidity, turbulence, and plasma, and the structural features of a liquid. It is widely used in modern astrophysics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":48},{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":65},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":85},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":101},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":214},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":262},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":271},{"uri":"Neurology","surface_form":"neurology","offset":282},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":332},{"uri":"Atomic_motion","surface_form":"atomic motion","offset":436},{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":540},{"uri":"Superconductivity","surface_form":"superconductivity","offset":616},{"uri":"Superfluidity","surface_form":"superfluidity","offset":635},{"uri":"Turbulence","surface_form":"turbulence","offset":650},{"uri":"Plasma_(physics)","surface_form":"plasma","offset":666},{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysics","offset":743}]}
