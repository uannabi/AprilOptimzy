{"id":657491,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achernar","text":"Achernar is the name of the primary (or 'A') component of the binary system designated Alpha Eridani (\u03B1 Eridani).\nOf the ten apparent brightest stars in the night-time sky, Alpha Eridani is the hottest and bluest in color, due to Achernar being of spectral type B. Achernar has an unusually rapid rotational velocity, causing it to become oblate in shape.\nThe secondary is smaller, of spectral type A, and orbits Achernar at a distance of about 12\u00A0astronomical units (AU).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Binary_star","surface_form":"binary system","offset":62},{"uri":"Apparent_magnitude","surface_form":"apparent","offset":125},{"uri":"Spectral_type","surface_form":"spectral type","offset":248},{"uri":"Stellar_rotation","surface_form":"rotational velocity","offset":297},{"uri":"Oblate","surface_form":"oblate","offset":339},{"uri":"Astronomical_unit","surface_form":"astronomical unit","offset":448}]}
