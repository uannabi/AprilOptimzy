{"id":65765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide","text":"Hydroxide in chemistry is a name given to the diatomic anion OH\u2212, made up of oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Most chemical compounds that contain hydroxides are bases.\nAn Arrhenius base is a substance that when dissolved in an aqueous solution, it produces hydroxide ions. Therefore, hydroxide ions are heavily involved in acid-base reactions.\nMany useful chemical reactions or processes involve hydroxide or hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is used in industry as a strong base, potassium hydroxide is used in agriculture, and iron hydroxide minerals such as goethite and limonite have been used as iron ore. The aluminium ore bauxite is made mainly out of aluminium hydroxides.\nMost inorganic hydroxide salts do not dissolve in water.\nUses of hydroxides.\nMany useful chemicals and chemical processes involve hydroxides or hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is used in factories as an alkali, potassium hydroxide is used in farming, and iron hydroxide have been used as low grade brown iron ore.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":13},{"uri":"Diatomic","surface_form":"diatomic","offset":46},{"uri":"Anion","surface_form":"anion","offset":55},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":77},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":88},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":97},{"uri":"Chemical_compounds","surface_form":"chemical compounds","offset":109},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":156},{"uri":"Arrhenius_base","surface_form":"Arrhenius base","offset":166},{"uri":"Solvation","surface_form":"dissolved","offset":206},{"uri":"Aqueous_solution","surface_form":"aqueous solution","offset":222},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":262},{"uri":"Acid-base","surface_form":"acid-base","offset":318},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"Sodium hydroxide","offset":420},{"uri":"Potassium_hydroxide","surface_form":"potassium hydroxide","offset":475},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":506},{"uri":"Iron_hydroxide","surface_form":"iron hydroxide","offset":523},{"uri":"Goethite","surface_form":"goethite","offset":555},{"uri":"Limonite","surface_form":"limonite","offset":568},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":600},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":609},{"uri":"Bauxite","surface_form":"bauxite","offset":623},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":764},{"uri":"Alkali","surface_form":"alkali","offset":879}]}
