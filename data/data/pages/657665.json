{"id":657665,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match","text":"The Money in the Bank ladder match is a multi-person ladder match held by the professional wrestling promotion WWE. First contested at WWE's annual WrestleMania event beginning in 2005, a separate Money in the Bank pay-per-view was established in 2010.\nHistory.\nIn WWE storyline, the concept for the Money in the Bank match was introduced in March 2005 by Chris Jericho. Jericho then pitched the idea to Raw general manager Eric Bischoff, who liked it and promptly began to book the match for WrestleMania 21. Edge won the inaugural match and held the contract until New Year's Revolution in January 2006. There, he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract against WWE Champion John Cena, who had just successfully defended the title in an Elimination Chamber match. Edge defeated Cena to become WWE Champion and quickly establishing the precedent of \"cashing in\" on a vulnerable champion.\nThe 2017 Money in the Bank pay-per-view took place on June 18, 2017 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri as a SmackDown brand exclusive event.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ladder_match","surface_form":"ladder match","offset":53},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestling","offset":78},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":111},{"uri":"WrestleMania","surface_form":"WrestleMania","offset":148},{"uri":"WWE_Money_in_the_Bank","surface_form":"Money in the Bank","offset":197},{"uri":"Kayfabe","surface_form":"storyline","offset":269},{"uri":"Chris_Jericho","surface_form":"Chris Jericho","offset":356},{"uri":"Eric_Bischoff","surface_form":"Eric Bischoff","offset":424},{"uri":"WrestleMania_21","surface_form":"WrestleMania 21","offset":493},{"uri":"Edge_(wrestler)","surface_form":"Edge","offset":510},{"uri":"New_Year%27s_Revolution_(2006)","surface_form":"New Year's Revolution","offset":567},{"uri":"John_Cena","surface_form":"John Cena","offset":678},{"uri":"Elimination_Chamber_match","surface_form":"Elimination Chamber match","offset":740},{"uri":"Money_in_the_Bank_(2017)","surface_form":"2017 Money in the Bank","offset":894},{"uri":"Scottrade_Center","surface_form":"Scottrade Center","offset":965},{"uri":"St._Louis","surface_form":"St. Louis","offset":985},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":996},{"uri":"SmackDown_(WWE_brand)","surface_form":"SmackDown","offset":1010}]}
