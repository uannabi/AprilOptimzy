{"id":65769,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale","text":"e=\"preserve\">Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a scale that is used to measure the consciousness of a person. It was invented in 1974 by \"Graham Teasdale\" and \"Bryan J. Jennett\", professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow.\nGCS is used in evaluation of patients, especially in ICUs. This scale consists of three tests, which are described below. A score is given for each test, and the GCS score is calculated by adding the scores given to each test. The maximum score is 15, which means the patient is fully conscious. The minimum score is 3, and is usually seen in patients with brain death or those in deep coma.\nElements of the scale.\nThe scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal (talking) and motor (movement) responses.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Consciousness","surface_form":"consciousness","offset":78},{"uri":"1974","surface_form":"1974","offset":124},{"uri":"Intensive_Care_Unit","surface_form":"ICU","offset":284},{"uri":"Brain_death","surface_form":"brain death","offset":588},{"uri":"Coma","surface_form":"coma","offset":617},{"uri":"Visual_perception","surface_form":"eye","offset":679},{"uri":"Speech","surface_form":"verbal","offset":684},{"uri":"Motor_skill","surface_form":"motor","offset":705}]}
