{"id":657888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks","text":"Hope Charlotte Hicks (born October 21, 1988) is an American public relations consultant and model. She was the White House Communications Director for U.S. President Donald Trump from August 2017 until March 29, 2018.\nFrom January to September 2017, she was White House Director of Strategic Communications. She was an employee of The Trump Organization.\nOn February 27, 2018, Hicks testified to a Congressional committee that she had told \"white lies\" on Trump's behalf. The next day, Hicks announced her resignation as White House Communications Director. She left the White House a month later.\nOn October 1, 2020 she tested positive for COVID-19. This raised concerns whether or not Trump, too, had COVID-19, as she had been on Air Force One recently and had travelled with the president to Cleveland, Ohio, for the first presidential debate.\nAside from working with Trump, Hicks also worked with Fox News.\nPersonal Life.\nHope grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut, to a family involved in politics. Both her parents worked for congressmen, her father working for a Connecticut Republican congressman, and her mother a Tennessee Democrat congressman (Ed Jones). She was also a model and, for a short time, an actress (performing in just one film) before joining the Trump administration. She also worked with Fox News. Hope met the president through his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, who Hope knew.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"White_House_Communications_Director","surface_form":"White House Communications Director","offset":111},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. President","offset":151},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":166},{"uri":"White_House_Director_of_Strategic_Communications","surface_form":"White House Director of Strategic Communications","offset":258},{"uri":"The_Trump_Organization","surface_form":"The Trump Organization","offset":331},{"uri":"COVID-19","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":641},{"uri":"Cleveland%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Cleveland, Ohio","offset":795},{"uri":"Fox_News_Channel","surface_form":"Fox News","offset":901},{"uri":"Greenwich%2C_Connecticut","surface_form":"Greenwich, Connecticut,","offset":942},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":1066},{"uri":"Republican","surface_form":"Republican","offset":1078},{"uri":"Tennessee_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Tennessee Democrat","offset":1119},{"uri":"Ed_Jones","surface_form":"Ed Jones","offset":1151},{"uri":"Fox_News_Channel","surface_form":"Fox News.","offset":1309},{"uri":"Ivanka_Trump","surface_form":"Ivanka Trump","offset":1371}]}
