By then, Felt was suffering from dementia and had denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein then confirmed the attorney's claim.\nHal Holbrook played Deep Throat in the 1976 political thriller \"All the President's Men\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pseudonym","surface_form":"pseudonym","offset":19},{"uri":"Bob_Woodward","surface_form":"Bob Woodward","offset":95},{"uri":"Carl_Bernstein","surface_form":"Carl Bernstein","offset":128},{"uri":"The_Washington_Post","surface_form":"The Washington Post","offset":187},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. President","offset":267},{"uri":"Richard_Nixon","surface_form":"Richard Nixon","offset":282},{"uri":"Watergate_scandal","surface_form":"Watergate scandal","offset":345},{"uri":"Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","surface_form":"Federal Bureau of Investigation","offset":479},{"uri":"Mark_Felt","surface_form":"Mark Felt","offset":536},{"uri":"Dementia","surface_form":"dementia","offset":596},{"uri":"Hal_Holbrook","surface_form":"Hal Holbrook","offset":703},{"uri":"All_the_President%27s_Men_(movie)","surface_form":"All the President's Men","offset":767}]}
