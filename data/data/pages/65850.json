{"id":65850,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister-President","text":"e=\"preserve\">A minister-president (German: \"Ministerpr\u00E4sident\") is the head of government in a number of European countries or subnational governments, who presides over the council of ministers. The title is similar to Prime Minister, First Minister, and President of the Council.\nThe German word means \"president of the ministers\"; \"Ministers' President\" would be a more accurate translation.\nThis person is the equivalent of a state premier in Australia, a provincial premier in Canada, or the Governor of a state in the USA.\nEach year one of the ministers-president, or one of the senior Mayors of the city states of Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen, is the President of the Bundesrat. Because Germany does not have a vice president, The President of the Bundesrat will act as the Federal President if the Federal President dies or is out of the country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":35},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":71},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":105},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":220},{"uri":"First_Minister","surface_form":"First Minister","offset":236},{"uri":"President_of_the_Council_of_Ministers","surface_form":"President of the Council","offset":256},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":447},{"uri":"Premier","surface_form":"premier","offset":471},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":482},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":524},{"uri":"City_state","surface_form":"city state","offset":606},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":621},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":629},{"uri":"Bremen","surface_form":"Bremen","offset":641},{"uri":"Bundesrat_of_Germany","surface_form":"Bundesrat","offset":673},{"uri":"President_of_the_Bundesrat_of_Germany","surface_form":"President of the Bundesrat","offset":736},{"uri":"President_of_Germany","surface_form":"Federal President","offset":779}]}
