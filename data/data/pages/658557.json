{"id":658557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_Persian","text":"=\"preserve\">The Himalayan Persian (or Colourpoint Persian as it is commonly referred to in Europe), is a breed or sub-breed of long-haired cat identical in type to the Persian, with the exception of its blue eyes and its point colouration, which were derived from crossing the Persian with the Siamese.\nSome registries may classify the Himalayan as a long-haired sub-breed of Siamese, or a colorpoint sub-breed of Persian. The World Cat Federation has merged them with the Colorpoint Shorthair and Javanese into a single breed, the Colorpoint. Sometimes the breed is called Pakistani breed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":139},{"uri":"Persian_cat","surface_form":"Persian","offset":168},{"uri":"Point_colouration","surface_form":"point colouration","offset":221},{"uri":"Siamese_cat","surface_form":"Siamese","offset":294},{"uri":"World_Cat_Federation","surface_form":"World Cat Federation","offset":427},{"uri":"Colorpoint_Shorthair","surface_form":"Colorpoint Shorthair","offset":473},{"uri":"Javanese_cat","surface_form":"Javanese","offset":498},{"uri":"Colorpoint","surface_form":"Colorpoint","offset":532}]}
