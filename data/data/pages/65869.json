{"id":65869,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struthiomimus","text":"\"Struthiomimus\" was a long-legged, ostrich-like dinosaur of the ornithomimid family. It lived in what is now Alberta, Canada, during the Upper Cretaceous, about 75 to 65 million years ago.\nDescription.\n\"Struthiomimus\" had a typical build and skeletal structure for an ornithomimid. It only differed from \"Ornithomimus\" in proportions and anatomical details. It is known from several skeletons and skulls, and its size is estimated as about long and tall at the hips, with a weight of around.\nAs with other ornithomimids, it had a small slender head on a long neck. The neck made up about 40% of the length of the body in front of the hips. Its eyes were large and its jaws were toothless. Its vertebral column had ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, six hip vertebrae, and about thirty-five tail vertebrae. The tail was stiff and was probably used for balance. It ground food up in its gizzard, and may have been herbivorous or omnivorous.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ostrich","surface_form":"ostrich","offset":35},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":48},{"uri":"Ornithomimid","surface_form":"ornithomimid","offset":64},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":109},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":118},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":137},{"uri":"Ornithomimus","surface_form":"Ornithomimus","offset":305},{"uri":"Vertebra","surface_form":"vertebra","offset":693},{"uri":"Gizzard","surface_form":"gizzard","offset":895},{"uri":"Herbivorous","surface_form":"herbivorous","offset":922},{"uri":"Omnivorous","surface_form":"omnivorous","offset":937}]}
