At the east is the German region Lower Saxony, in the south is Drenthe, in the west is Friesland (or Frysl\u00E2n in Frisian) and in the north is the Wadden Sea.\nThe capital of Groningen is also called Groningen. People from Groningen often call Groningen City \"stad\" (\"city\") and the rest of the province \"Ommelanden\" (which means something like \"surrounding lands\").\nImportant sources of income are agriculture and natural gas extraction Slochteren.\nNoticeable things in Groningen are the Gronings dialect, which is related to Low Saxon, and the strong support for the communist party in the Northeastern part of the province.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":15},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":48},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":80},{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxony","offset":94},{"uri":"Drenthe","surface_form":"Drenthe","offset":124},{"uri":"Friesland","surface_form":"Friesland","offset":148},{"uri":"Frysl%C3%A2n","surface_form":"Frysl\u00E2n","offset":162},{"uri":"Frisian","surface_form":"Frisian","offset":173},{"uri":"Wadden_Sea","surface_form":"Wadden Sea","offset":206},{"uri":"Groningen_(City)","surface_form":"Groningen","offset":258},{"uri":"Ommelanden","surface_form":"Ommelanden","offset":363},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":457},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":473},{"uri":"Slochteren","surface_form":"Slochteren","offset":496},{"uri":"Gronings","surface_form":"Gronings","offset":547},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":556},{"uri":"Low_Saxon","surface_form":"Low Saxon","offset":585},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communist","offset":627}]}
