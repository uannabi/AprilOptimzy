{"id":65880,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run","text":"e=\"preserve\">A home run, abbreviated HR, is a term in baseball for when the batter hits the ball and touches all the bases without an error being made by the team on defense. The most common way for a batter to hit a home run is to hit the ball over the outfield fence in fair territory. If the ball goes over the outfield fence but it is ruled a \"foul ball\", it does not count as a home run. Another way for a batter to hit a home run is to hit what is called an \"inside-the-park\" home run. If the batter touches all four bases after he hits the ball and it stays on the field, he scores a home run. This is an inside-the-park home run as long as no error is committed by the fielding team on the play.\nIn the early days of Major League Baseball, a home run was not awarded to a ball hit over the fence to win the game if the winning run scored before the batter-runner were to reach home plate to score. Therefore, what would otherwise be walk-off home runs were not commonplace, and players were often robbed of home runs. Due to this, for instance, Babe Ruth is not credited with a particular walk-off home run that would bring his career total to 715.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":54},{"uri":"Batter_(baseball)","surface_form":"batter","offset":76},{"uri":"Baseball_(ball)","surface_form":"ball","offset":92},{"uri":"Error","surface_form":"error","offset":134},{"uri":"Team","surface_form":"team","offset":158},{"uri":"Defense_(sports)","surface_form":"defense","offset":166},{"uri":"Baseball_park","surface_form":"park","offset":623},{"uri":"Babe_Ruth","surface_form":"Babe Ruth","offset":1053}]}
