Its capital was Dijon.\nHistory.\nBurgundy was named for the Germanic Burgundian tribe who moved there from an island in the Baltic Sea.

In the 15th century it was very powerful. The dukes ruled lands as far north as the Netherlands. After Duke Charles the Bold died when he wanted to conquer the city of Nancy in 1477, France took southern Burgundy. It was a province until 1790. The House of Habsburg got the northern part, which later became the Southern Netherlands.\nGeography.\nThe Burgundy region is one of the largest regions of Metropolitan France. It has an area of.

The valley of the Yonne river and its tributaries is to the north of the region. To the southeast is the valley of the Sa\u00F4ne river.\nIn the centre of the plateau (and of the region), there is a group of low mountains: the Morvan. The highest point in Burgundy, the Haut-Folin (), is in these mountains, in the Sa\u00F4ne-et-Loire department. It is high.\nThe main rivers of the region are Yonne, Arman\u00E7on, Loire, Seine and Sa\u00F4ne.\nThe climate of Burgundy is an oceanic climate with temperate summers, \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate) in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification.\nDemographics.\nThe Burgundy region has a population, in 2012, of 1,641,130, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nEconomy.\nThe region is known for its wines, both red and white. Many well-known wines, such as Macon and Beaujolais, were first made here. A few wines are also the 'Arbois'-type.
