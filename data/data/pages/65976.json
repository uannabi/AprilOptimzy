{"id":65976,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryonyx","text":"\"Baryonyx\" was a carnivorous theropod dinosaur discovered in clay pits just south of Dorking, England, and also in northern Spain. It has been dated to the Barremian stage of the Lower Cretaceous period, between 130 to 125 million years ago.\nIt was first discovered in 1983 by the amateur fossil hunter William Walker. A group of scientists lead by Alan Charig and Angela Milner of the Natural History Museum of London examined the skeleton and named the animal \"Baryonyx\" (meaning 'heavy claw'), and the species name \"walkeri\" after the man who discovered it. Other good skeletons were discovered in England and in Spain, which gave scientists a good idea of what the dinosaur was like.\n\"Baryonyx\" grew up to between long and weighed 1.2 and 1.7 t (1.3 and 1.9 short tons). It had long arms which were probably used for holding on to prey, the claw on the first finger was 31 centimeters (12\u00A0in) long. It ate mostly fish, like a grizzly bear would; for this it had a long snout like a gharial, and straight, cone-like teeth perfect for fishing. It had a triangle-shaped crest on the top of its skull.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivorous","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":17},{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":29},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":38},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":61},{"uri":"Dorking","surface_form":"Dorking","offset":85},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":94},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":124},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":179},{"uri":"Period_(geology)","surface_form":"period","offset":196},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":289},{"uri":"Natural_History_Museum","surface_form":"Natural History Museum","offset":386},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":412},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":505},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":917},{"uri":"Grizzly_bear","surface_form":"grizzly bear","offset":930},{"uri":"Gharial","surface_form":"gharial","offset":986},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":1095}]}
