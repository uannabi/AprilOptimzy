{"id":6598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Doorman","text":"Karel Willem Frederik Marie Doorman (April 23, 1889 in Utrecht - February 28, 1942) was a Dutch admiral (Dutch: \"schout-bij-nacht\") during World War II.\nIn 1942 he was made commander of the combined American, British, Dutch and Australian fleet in the Dutch East Indies.\nIn February 1942, he led his fleet against a much stronger Japanese fleet in the Java Sea. This battle became a disaster for the Allies. Doorman became a hero in the Netherlands, partly of his last words to the fleet: \"Ik val aan, volg mij!\" (I am attacking, follow me).\nKarel Doorman died when his ship \"De Ruyter\" (named after the famous Dutch Admiral Michiel de Ruyter) was hit by a torpedo and sank. There was enough time to escape, but Doorman rather went under with his ship, according to old tradition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"April_23","surface_form":"April 23","offset":37},{"uri":"1889","surface_form":"1889","offset":47},{"uri":"Utrecht_(city)","surface_form":"Utrecht","offset":55},{"uri":"February_28","surface_form":"February 28","offset":65},{"uri":"1942","surface_form":"1942","offset":78},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":90},{"uri":"Admiral","surface_form":"admiral","offset":96},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":105},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":139},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":199},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":209},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":218},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":228},{"uri":"Fleet_(ships)","surface_form":"fleet","offset":239},{"uri":"Dutch_East_Indies","surface_form":"Dutch East Indies","offset":252},{"uri":"February","surface_form":"February","offset":274},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":330},{"uri":"Java_Sea","surface_form":"Java Sea","offset":352},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allies","offset":400},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":425},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":570},{"uri":"HNLMS_De_Ruyter","surface_form":"\"De Ruyter\"","offset":575},{"uri":"Michiel_de_Ruyter","surface_form":"Michiel de Ruyter","offset":625},{"uri":"Torpedo","surface_form":"torpedo","offset":657},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":770}]}
