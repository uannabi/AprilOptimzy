{"id":6599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner","text":"\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is the national anthem of the United States. Francis Scott Key wrote the words to it in 1814 after seeing British ships attacking Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland during the War of 1812.\nThe words are set to the music of a British drinking song called \"To Anacreon in Heaven\". The song has 4 stanzas but only the first one is usually sung.\nLyrics.\nO say, can you see, by the dawn\u2019s early light,\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight\u2019s last gleaming,\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,\nO\u2019er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\nAnd the rockets\u2019 red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\nO say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\nOn the shore, dimly seen thro\u2019 the mist of the deep,\nWhere the foe\u2019s haughty host in dread silence reposes,\nWhat is that which the breeze, o\u2019er the towering steep,\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning\u2019s first beam,\nIn full glory reflected, now shines on the stream\n\u2019Tis the star-spangled banner. Oh! long may it wave\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore\nThat the havoc of war and the battle\u2019s confusion\nA home and a country should leave us no more?\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footstep\u2019s pollution.\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave,\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\nOh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\nBetween their loved homes and the war\u2019s desolation,\nBlest with vict\u2019ry and peace, may the Heav\u2019n-rescued land\nPraise the Pow\u2019r that hath made and preserved us a nation!\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\nAnd this be our motto\u2014\u201CIn God is our trust.\u201D\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":34},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":57},{"uri":"Francis_Scott_Key","surface_form":"Francis Scott Key","offset":72},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"British","offset":133},{"uri":"Fort_McHenry","surface_form":"Fort McHenry","offset":157},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore, Maryland","offset":173},{"uri":"War_of_1812","surface_form":"War of 1812","offset":204},{"uri":"To_Anacreon_in_Heaven","surface_form":"To Anacreon in Heaven","offset":283},{"uri":"Stanza","surface_form":"stanza","offset":322}]}
