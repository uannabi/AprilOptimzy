The fossil was originally confused with \"Cetiosaurus\", a similar sauropod.\n\"Cetiosauriscus\" was discovered in May 1898 by clay workers south of Peterborough and east of the Great Northern Railway. Pits in this region expose the fossil-rich sedimentary rocks of the marine Oxford Clay, one of the classic geological formations of British palaeontology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":22},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":31},{"uri":"Middle_Jurassic","surface_form":"Middle Jurassic","offset":100},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":131},{"uri":"Cetiosaurus","surface_form":"Cetiosaurus","offset":181},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":262},{"uri":"Peterborough","surface_form":"Peterborough","offset":284},{"uri":"Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)","surface_form":"Great Northern Railway","offset":313},{"uri":"Sedimentary_rocks","surface_form":"sedimentary rocks","offset":380},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"marine","offset":405},{"uri":"Oxford_Clay","surface_form":"Oxford Clay","offset":412},{"uri":"Geological_formation","surface_form":"geological formation","offset":444}]}
