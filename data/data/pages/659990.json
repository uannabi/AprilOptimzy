{"id":659990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinstein_effect","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Weinstein effect is a trend in which men and women come forward to accuse other famous or powerful men and women of sexual abuse, harassment or misconduct. The term \"Weinstein effect\" came into use in October 2017. That's when media outlets began reporting on alleged sexual abuse against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.\nThe effect gave rise to the Me Too movement. That movement encourages people to share any experience of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The two events caused a cascade of allegations. The allegations brought about a fast removal of many men and women in positions of power in the United States.\nAs a result, many notable figures were accused of sexual harassment/abuse such as Kevin Spacey, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, U.S. Representative John Conyers, United States Senator Al Franken, former Senate candidate Roy Moore, Les Moonves, Garrison Keillor, Welsh MP Carl Sargeant, Asia Argento and U.S. Associate Justice-nominee Brett Kavanaugh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trend","surface_form":"trend","offset":39},{"uri":"Sexual_abuse","surface_form":"sexual abuse","offset":133},{"uri":"Sexual_harassment","surface_form":"harassment","offset":147},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"movie producer","offset":306},{"uri":"Harvey_Weinstein","surface_form":"Harvey Weinstein","offset":321},{"uri":"Me_Too_movement","surface_form":"Me Too movement","offset":367},{"uri":"Sexual_harassment","surface_form":"sexual harassment","offset":443},{"uri":"Sexual_assault","surface_form":"sexual assault","offset":464},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":624},{"uri":"Kevin_Spacey","surface_form":"Kevin Spacey","offset":721},{"uri":"Charlie_Rose","surface_form":"Charlie Rose","offset":735},{"uri":"Louis_C.K.","surface_form":"Louis C.K.","offset":749},{"uri":"Dustin_Hoffman","surface_form":"Dustin Hoffman","offset":761},{"uri":"Matt_Lauer","surface_form":"Matt Lauer","offset":777},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"U.S. Representative","offset":789},{"uri":"John_Conyers","surface_form":"John Conyers","offset":809},{"uri":"United_States_Senator","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":823},{"uri":"Al_Franken","surface_form":"Al Franken","offset":845},{"uri":"Roy_Moore","surface_form":"Roy Moore","offset":881},{"uri":"Les_Moonves","surface_form":"Les Moonves","offset":892},{"uri":"Garrison_Keillor","surface_form":"Garrison Keillor","offset":905},{"uri":"Carl_Sargeant","surface_form":"Carl Sargeant","offset":932},{"uri":"Asia_Argento","surface_form":"Asia Argento","offset":947},{"uri":"Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. Associate Justice","offset":964},{"uri":"Brett_Kavanaugh","surface_form":"Brett Kavanaugh","offset":995}]}
