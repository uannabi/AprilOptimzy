{"id":660336,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Aurigae","text":"=\"preserve\">Epsilon Aurigae, also called Maaz or Almaaz, is a yellow supergiant star forming part of the Auriga constellation.\nIt is orbited by a binary star which is surrounded by a thick dusk cloud. The dust cloud only creates infrared light.\nThe dust cloud was originally thought to be the largest star known, before it was later revealed to not be a star. The largest star was later found to be VY Canis Majoris, and even later, Stephenson 2-18.\nAnother theory says that the dusk cloud could be a black hole, but this theory is no longer believed in.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yellow","surface_form":"yellow","offset":62},{"uri":"Supergiant","surface_form":"supergiant","offset":69},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":80},{"uri":"Auriga_(constellation)","surface_form":"Auriga","offset":105},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":112},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":229},{"uri":"List_of_largest_stars","surface_form":"largest star known","offset":293},{"uri":"VY_Canis_Majoris","surface_form":"VY Canis Majoris","offset":399},{"uri":"Stephenson_2-18","surface_form":"Stephenson 2-18","offset":433},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":501}]}
