{"id":66036,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Kazakhstan","text":"\"Meni\u0144 Qazaqstanym\" (Kazakh for \"My Kazakhstan\") has been the national anthem of Kazakhstan since 7 January 2006.\nHistory.\nThis song was originally a patriotic song written in 1956 in response to the Soviet Union's Virgin Lands programme. The tune was composed by Sh\u00E1mshi Qalda\u0131aqov with lyrics (words) by Jumeken N\u00E1jimedenov. In 2006, the first president of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev revised (changed) the lyrics before becoming the anthem.\nPoetic English version (unofficial).\nIn thy sky sun of gold,\nIn thy steppes seeds of gold,\n\"As thy flower I shall plant thee,\"\n\"Oh nation as thy song I shall chant thee,\"\n\"My native country \u2013 oh my Kazakhstan!\"\nIn the vast land I have.\nIn this free land I have.\nWhat a blessed land thou art,\nShalt thou be in my heart.\nParodies.\nThere is a parody version of the anthem\u2014in an entirely different tune\u2014which comes at the end of 2005 mockumentary film \"Borat\". It is titled \"O Kazakhstan\". The actor who played Borat Sagdiyev, Sacha Baron Cohen, has been threatened with lawsuits by the Government of Kazakhstan after the execution (release) of the film.\nPlayback incidents.\nIn March 2012, the full \"Borat\" soundtrack was played at the International Shooting Grand Prix in Kuwait with Gold-winner Mariya Dmitriyenko. Kazakh officials were angered by this incident and complained. A few weeks earlier, at a festival of a ski resort in Qostana\u0131, the first part of Ricky Martin's single \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" was played accidentally before it was immediately changed to \"Meni\u0144 Qazaqstanym\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kazakh_language","surface_form":"Kazakh","offset":21},{"uri":"Virgin_Lands_campaign","surface_form":"Virgin Lands","offset":215},{"uri":"Shamshi_Kaldayakov","surface_form":"Sh\u00E1mshi Qalda\u0131aqov","offset":264},{"uri":"President_of_Kazakhstan","surface_form":"president of Kazakhstan","offset":346},{"uri":"Nursultan_Nazarbayev","surface_form":"Nursultan Nazarbayev","offset":370},{"uri":"Borat","surface_form":"Borat","offset":897},{"uri":"Borat_Sagdiyev","surface_form":"Borat Sagdiyev","offset":955},{"uri":"Sacha_Baron_Cohen","surface_form":"Sacha Baron Cohen","offset":971},{"uri":"Government_of_Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Government of Kazakhstan","offset":1031},{"uri":"Mariya_Dmitriyenko","surface_form":"Mariya Dmitriyenko","offset":1241},{"uri":"Ricky_Martin","surface_form":"Ricky Martin","offset":1406},{"uri":"Livin%27_La_Vida_Loca","surface_form":"Livin' La Vida Loca","offset":1429}]}
