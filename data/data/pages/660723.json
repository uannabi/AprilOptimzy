He worked in electrical engineering and lasers.\nWith Donna Strickland, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their co-invention of a technique called chirped pulse amplification, or CPA.\nIn 1994, Mourou and his team at the University of Michigan discovered that the balance between Kerr effect and self-diffraction by ionization act as waveguides for the beam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lasers","surface_form":"lasers","offset":105},{"uri":"Donna_Strickland","surface_form":"Donna Strickland","offset":118},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":147},{"uri":"Chirped_pulse_amplification","surface_form":"chirped pulse amplification","offset":215},{"uri":"University_of_Michigan","surface_form":"University of Michigan","offset":288},{"uri":"Kerr_effect","surface_form":"Kerr effect","offset":347},{"uri":"Diffraction","surface_form":"diffraction","offset":368},{"uri":"Ion","surface_form":"ion","offset":383},{"uri":"Waveguide","surface_form":"waveguide","offset":401}]}
