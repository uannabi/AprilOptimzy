She worked in the field of lasers. In 2018, she shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with G\u00E9rard Mourou, as they both developed chirped pulse amplification. This is useful in laser micromachining, laser surgery, medicine, and in science.\nShe is an associate professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Waterloo. She is the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":56},{"uri":"Guelph","surface_form":"Guelph","offset":83},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":135},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":167},{"uri":"G%C3%A9rard_Mourou","surface_form":"G\u00E9rard Mourou","offset":195},{"uri":"Chirped_pulse_amplification","surface_form":"chirped pulse amplification","offset":233},{"uri":"Laser_machining","surface_form":"laser micromachining","offset":280},{"uri":"Laser_surgery","surface_form":"laser surgery","offset":302},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":334},{"uri":"Associate_professor","surface_form":"associate professor","offset":353},{"uri":"University_of_Waterloo","surface_form":"University of Waterloo","offset":420},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":478}]}
