{"id":660737,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_stove","text":"=\"preserve\">An electric stove is a stove with electrical heating to cook and bake. The electric stove became popular as a replacement to the solid fuel (wood or coal) stove. Solid fuel stoves required more labor to maintain and operate.\nElectric stove burners may be controlled by a rotary switch with a finite number of positions (six, for example). Some may have a thermostat.\nThe first technology used resistive heating coils. The coils heated iron hotplates. Pots were placed on top of them.\nIn the 1970s, glass-ceramic stoves began appearing. Glass-ceramic has very low thermal conductivity. It's a coefficient thermal expansion of almost zero. It lets infrared radition pass very well. Electrical heating coils or infrared halogen lamps are used for heating elements.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stove","surface_form":"stove","offset":35},{"uri":"Heating_element","surface_form":"electrical heating","offset":46},{"uri":"Rotary_switch","surface_form":"rotary switch","offset":283},{"uri":"Thermostat","surface_form":"thermostat","offset":367},{"uri":"Thermal_conductivity","surface_form":"thermal conductivity","offset":575},{"uri":"Halogen","surface_form":"halogen","offset":729}]}
