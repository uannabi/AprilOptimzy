Yaghi (Arabic: \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0646\u0651\u0633 \u064A\u0627\u063A\u064A, born February 9, 1965) is a Jordanian-American chemist. He was born in Amman, Jordan. He is a Professor of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Yaghi is known for creating reticular chemistry, which is a new field of chemistry. It focuses on the stitching of molecular building blocks together by strong bonds to make open frameworks.\nHis most well known work is in the design and production of new classes of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). He studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nIn 2017, he won the Albert Einstein World Award of Science. In 2018, Yaghi won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":15},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":86},{"uri":"Amman","surface_form":"Amman","offset":110},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":117},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":163},{"uri":"Metal-organic_framework","surface_form":"metal-organic framework","offset":484},{"uri":"University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","surface_form":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","offset":535},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein_World_Award_of_Science","surface_form":"Albert Einstein World Award of Science","offset":599},{"uri":"Wolf_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Wolf Prize in Chemistry","offset":662}]}
