{"id":660838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Unity_Day","text":"=\"preserve\">German Unity Day is the national day of Germany, celebrated on 3 October as a public holiday. It commemorates the anniversary of German reunification in 1990.\nAn alternative was the day the Berlin Wall came down: 9 November 1989. This was the day of the German Republic in 1918, and the defeat of Hitler's first coup in 1923.\nHowever, 9 November was also the anniversary of the first large-scale Nazi-led pogroms against Jews in 1938 (\"Kristallnacht\"), so the day was thought inappropriate as a national holiday.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_day","surface_form":"national day","offset":36},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":52},{"uri":"German_reunification","surface_form":"German reunification","offset":141},{"uri":"Berlin_Wall","surface_form":"Berlin Wall","offset":202},{"uri":"German_Republic","surface_form":"German Republic","offset":266},{"uri":"Beer_Hall_Putsch","surface_form":"Hitler's first coup","offset":309},{"uri":"Pogrom","surface_form":"pogrom","offset":417},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":433},{"uri":"Kristallnacht","surface_form":"Kristallnacht","offset":448}]}
