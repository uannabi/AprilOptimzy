{"id":66112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivist","text":"An archivist is a professional who collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to information determined to have long-term value. The information maintained by an archivist can be any form of media (photographs, video or sound recordings, letters, documents, electronic records, etc.).\n\"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records.\"\nDetermining what records have enduring value is not always easy. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service. The theory and scholarly work underpinning archives practices is called archival science.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Preservation","surface_form":"preserves","offset":56},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":224},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":231},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":244},{"uri":"Sound_recording","surface_form":"sound recording","offset":253},{"uri":"Electronic_record","surface_form":"electronic record","offset":291},{"uri":"Archives","surface_form":"archives","offset":784},{"uri":"Archival_science","surface_form":"archival science","offset":813}]}
