Today its dinosaur collection has the world's largest collection of Jurassic dinosaurs. Its \"Dinosaurs in Their Time\" exhibition is the third largest collection of mounted, displayed dinosaurs in the United States (behind the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History).\nNotable specimens include one of the world's only fossils of a juvenile \"Apatosaurus\", the world's first specimen of a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", and a recently identified species of oviraptorosaur named \"Anzu wyliei\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"natural history","offset":69},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":85},{"uri":"Oakland_(Pittsburgh)","surface_form":"Oakland","offset":128},{"uri":"Pittsburgh","surface_form":"Pittsburgh","offset":152},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":164},{"uri":"Industrialist","surface_form":"industrialist","offset":222},{"uri":"Andrew_Carnegie","surface_form":"Andrew Carnegie","offset":236},{"uri":"Diplodocus","surface_form":"Diplodocus","offset":471},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":552},{"uri":"Smithsonian","surface_form":"Smithsonian","offset":710},{"uri":"National_Museum_of_Natural_History","surface_form":"National Museum of Natural History","offset":724},{"uri":"American_Museum_of_Natural_History","surface_form":"American Museum of Natural History","offset":767},{"uri":"Apatosaurus","surface_form":"Apatosaurus","offset":877},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus_rex","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus rex","offset":924},{"uri":"Oviraptorosaur","surface_form":"oviraptorosaur","offset":981},{"uri":"Anzu","surface_form":"Anzu","offset":1003}]}
