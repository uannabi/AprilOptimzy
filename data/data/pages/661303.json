{"id":661303,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Spock","text":"Benjamin McLane Spock (May 2, 1903 \u2013 March 15, 1998) was an American pediatrician whose book \"Baby and Child Care\" (1946) is one of the best-sellers of all time. The book said to mothers \"you know more than you think you do\".\nSpock was the first pediatrician to study psychoanalysis to try to understand children's needs. His ideas influenced parents to be more flexible and affectionate with their children, and to treat them as individuals. However, his theories were also widely criticized by colleagues. According to the critics, he relied too heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than serious academic research.\nSpock was regarded as a radical during the troubled times of the Vietnam War.\nSpock won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1924 while attending Yale University.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pediatrics","surface_form":"pediatrician","offset":69},{"uri":"The_Common_Sense_Book_of_Baby_and_Child_Care","surface_form":"Baby and Child Care","offset":94},{"uri":"Psychoanalysis","surface_form":"psychoanalysis","offset":268},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":682},{"uri":"Olympic","surface_form":"Olympic","offset":708},{"uri":"Gold_medal","surface_form":"gold medal","offset":716},{"uri":"Rowing","surface_form":"rowing","offset":730},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":761}]}
