China became known worldwide for all these features.\nThroughout this period, China had been ruled by many different dynasties, or ruling family lines. They included the Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, Song, Mongol, Ming, and Manchu dynasties. There were also several periods where China had been ruled by several different kingdoms.\nThroughout most of Imperial China, China had been ruled by emperors and empresses who were Han Chinese.

They were ruled by the Mongols and Manchus in that same order.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"History_of_China","surface_form":"Chinese history","offset":43},{"uri":"Qin_Shi_Huang","surface_form":"Qin Shi Huang","offset":102},{"uri":"Qin_dynasty","surface_form":"Qin dynasty","offset":145},{"uri":"Qing_dynasty","surface_form":"Qing dynasty","offset":203},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":312},{"uri":"Confucianism","surface_form":"Confucianism","offset":334},{"uri":"Chinese_characters","surface_form":"Chinese characters","offset":431},{"uri":"Han_dynasty","surface_form":"Han","offset":625},{"uri":"Sui_Dynasty","surface_form":"Sui","offset":630},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang","offset":635},{"uri":"Song_Dynasty","surface_form":"Song","offset":641},{"uri":"Yuan_dynasty","surface_form":"Mongol","offset":647},{"uri":"Ming_dynasty","surface_form":"Ming","offset":655},{"uri":"Qing_dynasty","surface_form":"Manchu","offset":665},{"uri":"Minority_group","surface_form":"minority groups","offset":955},{"uri":"Mongols","surface_form":"Mongols","offset":1032},{"uri":"Manchu","surface_form":"Manchus","offset":1044}]}
