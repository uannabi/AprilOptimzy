{"id":661451,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test","text":"e=\"preserve\">A standardized test is a test that is done and scored in a consistent, or \"standard\", manner. Standardized tests are designed so that everything about them are standard. They are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner.\nOften they are used as a test to join an institution or gain a license of some sort. The grading system is the same no matter where they are taken. They can be used for university entry, like the SAT and ACT in the United States or the Gaokao in the People's Republic of China (PRC). They can be used a requirement to get a job, like the LSAT for lawyers.\nIn the United States the term is often used for the multiple-choice questions used in the educational system. They are thought by some to be a poor way to measure educational progress. They are, however, convenient and cheap. Marking does not require expertise in the subject-matter.\nMany psychological tests are designed to be standardized. They are designed to be \"an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior\".\nThe first known standardized test was in Imperial China, when Empress Wu allowed anyone who passed the test to be a government official based on their merit rather than birthright, meaning that people work to become leaders rather than being born into leadership. However, we do not know the details of this system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Test_(assessment)","surface_form":"test","offset":38},{"uri":"SAT","surface_form":"SAT","offset":449},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":468},{"uri":"National_Higher_Education_Entrance_Examination","surface_form":"Gaokao","offset":489},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China (PRC)","offset":503},{"uri":"Multiple-choice","surface_form":"multiple-choice","offset":661},{"uri":"Psychological_test","surface_form":"psychological test","offset":898},{"uri":"Imperial_China","surface_form":"Imperial China","offset":1081},{"uri":"Empress_Wu","surface_form":"Empress Wu","offset":1102},{"uri":"Meritocracy","surface_form":"merit","offset":1191},{"uri":"Birthright","surface_form":"birthright","offset":1209}]}
