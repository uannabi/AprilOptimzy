{"id":661467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_hole","text":"=\"preserve\">In fiction, a plot hole is a part of a story that goes against something that has already been stated. These may include events that should not happen according for in-universe reasons, events that seem unlikely or events that contradict earlier events in the narrative.\nThe term can also be used to describe a situation that has not been resolved by the end of the plot, even though there will be no continuing story.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
