{"id":661476,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_test","text":"e=\"preserve\">Psychological testing of the modern type started about 150 years ago. Francis Galton (1822\u20131911) invented the first tests. The American psychologist James Cattell (1860\u20131944) studied with Galton and then, in 1890, published a classic paper \"Mental Tests and Measurements\".\nPsychologists who give these tests have training and qualifications which tell the employer that they are certified to give the tests and assess (understand) the results.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Francis_Galton","surface_form":"Francis Galton","offset":83},{"uri":"James_Cattell","surface_form":"James Cattell","offset":162}]}
