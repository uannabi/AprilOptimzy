{"id":661493,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michael","text":"Hurricane Michael was an Atlantic tropical cyclone. The storm threatened Cuba, northwestern Florida, Georgia and southern Alabama. Michael was the 13th named storm, seventh hurricane, and the second major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the first Category 5 hurricane and the strongest on record to impact the Florida Panhandle, and was the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the United States in terms of wind speed. As Michael became a Category 5 hurricane, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season became a third consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Irma in 2017; this also makes Michael the third straight \"M\" name to feature as a Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Maria in 2017 as well.\nThe storm passed near western Cuba on October 7-8.\nThe storm led to six deaths in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador.\nMichael became a major hurricane on Tuesday, October 9, 2018.\nThe storm struck near Mexico Beach, Florida in the Florida Panhandle as a borderline Category 5 hurricane, which makes it the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States as a Category 5 hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. It had a wind speed of 160 mph and a central pressure of 919 millibars. It was originally designated as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with wind speed of 155 mph, but from post-analysis, it was indeed a Category 5 hurricane as originally thought. It was said to be the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since Andrew in 1992 in terms of pressure which it had a central pressure of 922 millibars. It was also the the strongest hurricane to hit the United States in terms of pressure since Hurricane Camille in 1969, which had a pressure of 900 millibars.\nRetirement.\nOn March 20, 2019, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name \"Michael\" due to extreme and very expensive damage it caused along its track, particularly in the Florida Panhandle and southwest Georgia, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with \"Milton\" for the 2024 season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"Atlantic tropical cyclone","offset":25},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":73},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":92},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":101},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":122},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":173},{"uri":"2018_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2018 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":222},{"uri":"Florida_Panhandle","surface_form":"Florida Panhandle","offset":334},{"uri":"Hurricane_Matthew","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":611},{"uri":"2016_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2016","offset":622},{"uri":"Hurricane_Irma","surface_form":"Irma","offset":631},{"uri":"2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2017","offset":639},{"uri":"Hurricane_Maria","surface_form":"Maria","offset":760},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":865},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":883},{"uri":"El_Salvador","surface_form":"El Salvador","offset":906},{"uri":"Mexico_Beach%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Mexico Beach, Florida","offset":1003},{"uri":"Florida_Panhandle","surface_form":"Florida Panhandle","offset":1032},{"uri":"Hurricane_Andrew","surface_form":"Hurricane Andrew","offset":1200},{"uri":"Hurricane_Andrew","surface_form":"Andrew","offset":1537},{"uri":"Hurricane_Camille","surface_form":"Hurricane Camille","offset":1715},{"uri":"1969_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1969","offset":1736},{"uri":"World_Meteorological_Organization","surface_form":"World Meteorological Organization","offset":1816}]}
