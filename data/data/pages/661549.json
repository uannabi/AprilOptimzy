{"id":661549,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Schoharie%2C_New_York_limousine_crash","text":"e=\"preserve\">In the early afternoon of October 6, 2018, a limousine crashed at the New York state routes 30 and 30A north of Schoharie, west of Albany. The crash killed 20 people: the driver, all 17 passengers, and two pedestrians who were in a nearby parking lot.\nIt is the worst transportation-related disaster in both the state and the nation since a plane crashed into a house outside Buffalo in 2009, killing 50. It is also the deadliest road transportation disaster in the U.S. since 2005.\nThe passengers were a group of young adults who were on their way to celebrate one member's 30th birthday at a local winery. Among them were four sisters and two recently married couples. Investigation of the crash has revealed some safety issues with the limousine and driver.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Limousine","surface_form":"limousine","offset":58},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York state","offset":83},{"uri":"New_York_State_Route_30","surface_form":"30","offset":105},{"uri":"New_York_State_Route_30A","surface_form":"30A","offset":112},{"uri":"Schoharie%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Schoharie","offset":125},{"uri":"Albany%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Albany","offset":144},{"uri":"Parking_lot","surface_form":"parking lot","offset":252},{"uri":"Colgan_Air_Flight_3407","surface_form":"plane crashed into a house outside Buffalo in 2009","offset":354}]}
