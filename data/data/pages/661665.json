{"id":661665,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Parable","text":"\"The Stanley Parable\" is an interactive storytelling video game designed by Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free modification for \"Half-Life 2\".\nA high-definition stand-alone remake, including new story elements, was again designed by Davey Wreden together with Source engine modeler William Pugh and was released on October 17, 2013 for Microsoft Windows. Later updates of the game added support for OS X on December 19, 2013, and for Linux on September 9, 2015.\nThe player has the opportunity to make numerous decisions on which paths, Stanley the protagonist, to take, and because at times the narrator says what Stanley will do next, the player can choose to ignore the narration and make a different choice. Every choice made by the player is commented on by the narrator, and depending on the choices the player makes, they will encounter different endings to the game before it restarts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interactive_storytelling","surface_form":"interactive storytelling","offset":28},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":53},{"uri":"Freeware","surface_form":"free","offset":145},{"uri":"Mod_(video_gaming)","surface_form":"modification","offset":150},{"uri":"Half-Life_2","surface_form":"Half-Life 2","offset":168},{"uri":"Source_(game_engine)","surface_form":"Source engine","offset":299},{"uri":"William_Pugh_(game_designer)","surface_form":"William Pugh","offset":321},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":375},{"uri":"OS_X","surface_form":"OS X","offset":438},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":473},{"uri":"Protagonist","surface_form":"protagonist","offset":587}]}
