{"id":661725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition","text":"e=\"preserve\">In linear algebra, the singular-value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a positive semidefinite normal matrix (for example, a symmetric matrixwith positive eigenvalues) to any \u00A0matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition. It has many useful applications in signal processing and statistics.\nFormally, the singular-value decomposition of an \u00A0real or complex matrix \u00A0is a factorization of the form, where \u00A0is an \u00A0real or complex unitary matrix, \u00A0is an \u00A0rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and \u00A0is an \u00A0real or complex unitary matrix. The diagonal entries \u00A0of \u00A0are known as the singular values of. The columns of \u00A0and the columns of \u00A0are called the left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of, respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Linear_algebra","surface_form":"linear algebra","offset":16}]}
