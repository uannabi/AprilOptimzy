Its origins lie in the ' (royal garden of medicinal plants) created by King Louis XIII in 1635, which was directed and run by the royal physicians. The royal proclamation of the boy-king Louis XV on 31 March 1718 removed the purely medical function. This allowed the garden, the ' (King's garden), to focus on natural history.\nFor much of the 18th century (1739\u20131788), the garden was under the direction of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of the leading naturalists of the Enlightenment. It brought international fame and prestige to the establishment. The royal institution survived the French Revolution by being reorganized in 1793 as a republican ' with twelve professorships of equal rank. Some of its early professors included eminent comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier and evolutionary pioneers Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and \u00C9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The museum's aims were to instruct the public, put together collections and conduct scientific research.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"natural history","offset":103},{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":119},{"uri":"Sorbonne","surface_form":"Sorbonne Universities","offset":150},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":195},{"uri":"Seine","surface_form":"Seine","offset":232},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":273},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":525},{"uri":"Louis_XIII_of_France","surface_form":"King Louis XIII","offset":615},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":680},{"uri":"Louis_XV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XV","offset":731},{"uri":"Georges-Louis_Leclerc%2C_Comte_de_Buffon","surface_form":"Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon","offset":951},{"uri":"Natural_history","surface_form":"naturalists","offset":1010},{"uri":"Age_of_Enlightenment","surface_form":"Enlightenment","offset":1029},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":1144},{"uri":"Comparative_anatomy","surface_form":"comparative anatomist","offset":1297},{"uri":"Georges_Cuvier","surface_form":"Georges Cuvier","offset":1319},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1338},{"uri":"Jean-Baptiste_de_Lamarck","surface_form":"Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck","offset":1360},{"uri":"%C3%89tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","surface_form":"\u00C9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire","offset":1389}]}
