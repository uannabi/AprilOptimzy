{"id":66203,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_borough","text":"e=\"preserve\">A metropolitan borough (or metropolitan district) is a type of local government district in England and covers urban areas within metropolitan counties.\nCurrent metropolitan boroughs (post 1974).\nThe current metropolitan boroughs were created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as subdivisions of the new metropolitan counties which were created to cover the six largest urban areas in England outside Greater London\nThe new authorities were actually defined by law as metropolitan districts, however all of them have borough status or city status. The new metropolitan boroughs replaced the county boroughs, municipal boroughs and urban and rural districts which existed before. The districts typically have populations of 174,000 to 1.1 million.\nIn 1986 the old metropolitan county councils were abolished by the Local Government Act 1985 and most of their functions were given to the boroughs, so they are to a large extent unitary authorities. Some of the functions of the abolished county councils were taken over by joint bodies such as Passenger Transport Authorities, and joint fire, police and waste disposal authorities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Local_government","surface_form":"local government","offset":76},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":105},{"uri":"Metropolitan_county","surface_form":"metropolitan counties","offset":143},{"uri":"Local_Government_Act_1972","surface_form":"Local Government Act 1972","offset":271},{"uri":"Metropolitan_county","surface_form":"metropolitan counties","offset":324},{"uri":"Greater_London","surface_form":"Greater London","offset":421},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":537},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":555},{"uri":"County_borough","surface_form":"county borough","offset":611},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipal","offset":628},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":638},{"uri":"Urban_district","surface_form":"urban","offset":651},{"uri":"Rural_district","surface_form":"rural district","offset":661},{"uri":"Local_Government_Act_1985","surface_form":"Local Government Act 1985","offset":834},{"uri":"Unitary_authority","surface_form":"unitary authorities","offset":946}]}
