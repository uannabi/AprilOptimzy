The mission lasted roughly 30 minutes before being aborted.\nMS-10 was the 139th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. It was planned to transport two members of the Expedition 57 crew to the International Space Station. A few minutes after liftoff, the craft went into contingency abort due to a booster failure and had to return to Earth. Both crew members, Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague, were recovered alive in good health.\nThe MS-10 flight abort was the first instance of a manned booster accident at high altitude in 43 years, since Soyuz 18a similarly failed to achieve orbit in April 1975.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soyuz_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Soyuz","offset":25},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":100},{"uri":"Expedition_57","surface_form":"Expedition 57","offset":265},{"uri":"International_Space_Station","surface_form":"International Space Station","offset":291},{"uri":"Roscosmos","surface_form":"Roscosmos","offset":459},{"uri":"Aleksey_Ovchinin","surface_form":"Aleksey Ovchinin","offset":479},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":500},{"uri":"Nick_Hague","surface_form":"Nick Hague","offset":515},{"uri":"Soyuz_18a","surface_form":"Soyuz 18a","offset":675}]}
