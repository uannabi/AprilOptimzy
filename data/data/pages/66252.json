{"id":66252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1985","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Local Government Act 1985 was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Its main effect was to abolish the county councils of the metropolitan counties that had been set up in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, along with the Greater London Council that had been established in 1965.\nThe main provision, section 1 stated that \"the Greater London Council; and the metropolitan county councils\" shall not exist anymore.\nIt came into effect on 1 April 1986. The metropolitan boroughs and London boroughs got some of the powers of the former institutions, but others went to central government. At the time of the Act, one third of the population of England were living in Greater London and the metropolitan counties.\nThe act established a system of joint-boards to take over some of the functions of the abolished councils in the metropolitan counties and in Greater London. The joint-boards had councillors appointed by the boroughs.\nThe Act was passed by Margaret Thatcher's government after a series of disputes between the councils and the central government.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Act_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Act of Parliament","offset":50},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":75},{"uri":"Abolish","surface_form":"abolish","offset":114},{"uri":"County_council","surface_form":"county council","offset":126},{"uri":"Metropolitan_county","surface_form":"metropolitan counties","offset":149},{"uri":"Local_Government_Act_1972","surface_form":"Local Government Act 1972","offset":207},{"uri":"Greater_London_Council","surface_form":"Greater London Council","offset":249},{"uri":"Provision","surface_form":"provision","offset":316},{"uri":"Metropolitan_borough","surface_form":"metropolitan borough","offset":482},{"uri":"London_borough","surface_form":"London borough","offset":508},{"uri":"Greater_London","surface_form":"Greater London","offset":880},{"uri":"Margaret_Thatcher","surface_form":"Margaret Thatcher","offset":978},{"uri":"Government_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"central government","offset":1065}]}
