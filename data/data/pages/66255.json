{"id":66255,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London_Authority","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Greater London Authority (GLA) controls the 1579 km\u00B2 (610 sq. miles) of Greater London, England, covering the 32 London boroughs and the City of London. The GLA members are the Mayor and the 25 people the London Assembly. The current Mayor of London is Sadiq Khan.\nPurpose.\nThe GLA was created to improve the coordination between the London boroughs, and the Mayor of London's role is to give London a single person to represent it. The Mayor proposes policy and the GLA's budget, and makes appointments to the capital's strategic transport body (Transport for London) and economic development body (the London Development Agency).\nOne of the primary purposes of the London Assembly is to hold the Mayor of London to account. The Assembly must also accept or amend(change) the Mayor's budget on an annual basis(every year).\nThe GLA is different from the Corporation of the City of London with its largely ceremonial Lord Mayor. Corporation controls only the square mile of the City, London's chief financial centre. The GLA governs a much wider area\nThe GLA is at City Hall, a new building on the south bank of the River Thames, next to Tower Bridge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Km%C2%B2","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":66},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":79},{"uri":"Greater_London","surface_form":"Greater London","offset":89},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":105},{"uri":"London_Boroughs","surface_form":"London boroughs","offset":130},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City of London","offset":154},{"uri":"Mayor_of_London","surface_form":"Mayor","offset":194},{"uri":"London_Assembly","surface_form":"London Assembly","offset":222},{"uri":"Sadiq_Khan","surface_form":"Sadiq Khan","offset":270},{"uri":"Mayor_of_London","surface_form":"Mayor of London","offset":376},{"uri":"Transport_for_London","surface_form":"Transport for London","offset":564},{"uri":"London_Development_Agency","surface_form":"London Development Agency","offset":621},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City of London","offset":890},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":1132},{"uri":"Tower_Bridge","surface_form":"Tower Bridge","offset":1154}]}
