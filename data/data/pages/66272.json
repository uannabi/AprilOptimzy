It is a branch of the Foreign Service, and reports to the Joint Intelligence Committee.\nThe service was formed in 1909 as the Secret Service Bureau, but its existence was not officially acknowledged until 1994.\nThe service works with the Security Service (MI5), Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the Defence Intelligence (DIS). SIS deal with the United Kingdom's espionage (spying) activities outside the United Kingdom.\nThe headquarters are at Vauxhall Cross in London in a purpose-built building.
