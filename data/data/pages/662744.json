{"id":662744,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iboga","text":"\"Tabernanthe iboga\" or simply iboga is a perennial rainforest shrub, native to western Central Africa. Iboga can be used as a drug; it stimulates the central nervous system when taken in small doses and induces hallucinations in larger doses. In parts of Africa where the plant grows, the bark of the root is chewed for various pharmacological or ritualistic purposes. Ibogaine, the active alkaloid, is also used to treat substance abuse disorders and depression. A small amount of ibogaine, along with precursors of ibogaine, are found in \"Voacanga africana\".\nNormally, the plant grows to a height of about 2m. It may eventually grow into a small tree up to 10\u00A0m tall. It has small green leaves. Its flowers are white and pink, while the fruit can be either an elongated oval shape, or a round spherical shape. Fruits are orange in color. Its yellow-colored roots contain a number of indole alkaloids, most notably ibogaine, which is found in the highest concentration in the root-bark. The root material, bitter in taste, causes anesthetic sensation in the mouth as well as systemic numbness to the skin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Perennial_plant","surface_form":"perennial","offset":41},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":51},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":62},{"uri":"Central_Africa","surface_form":"Central Africa","offset":87},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":150},{"uri":"Hallucination","surface_form":"hallucinations","offset":211},{"uri":"Ibogaine","surface_form":"Ibogaine","offset":369},{"uri":"Alkaloid","surface_form":"alkaloid","offset":390},{"uri":"Voacanga_africana","surface_form":"Voacanga africana","offset":541},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":648},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":689},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":701},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":739},{"uri":"Indole","surface_form":"indole","offset":885},{"uri":"Alkaloid","surface_form":"alkaloid","offset":892},{"uri":"Ibogaine","surface_form":"ibogaine","offset":916},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":1059}]}
