{"id":66339,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denomination_(currency)","text":"e=\"preserve\">When dealing with money, denomination is the value of the individual currency.\nFor example a one dollar bill, a 100 dollar bill, a penny and a quarter are all different denominations of money. A one dollar bill and a one dollar coin are the same denomination as they are the same value.\nMonetary union.\nWhen countries form a monetary union, redenomination may be required and the conversion ratio is often not a nice even number, or even less than 1.\nDecimalisation.\nWhen countries that had a \"pound (\u00A3) - shilling (s) - pence (d)\" (\u00A3sd) currency system converted to a system which had pounds (\u00A3) and pennies (p) or dollars ($) and cents (\u00A2) it was called decimalisation. In the \u00A3sd system, \u00A31 = 20s and 1s = 12d, so \u00A31 = 240d. However in the new systems \u00A31 = 100p or $1 = 100\u00A2 or 100c - a decimal-based system, hence the word \"decimalised\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":31},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":82},{"uri":"US_dollar","surface_form":"dollar","offset":110},{"uri":"US_dollar","surface_form":"dollar","offset":129},{"uri":"Penny","surface_form":"penny","offset":144},{"uri":"US_dollar","surface_form":"dollar","offset":212},{"uri":"US_dollar","surface_form":"dollar","offset":234},{"uri":"Pound_(currency)","surface_form":"pound (\u00A3)","offset":507},{"uri":"Shilling","surface_form":"shilling (s)","offset":519},{"uri":"Penny","surface_form":"pence (d)","offset":534},{"uri":"%C2%A3sd","surface_form":"\u00A3sd","offset":546},{"uri":"Base_10","surface_form":"decimal-based","offset":803}]}
