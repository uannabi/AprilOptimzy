{"id":66362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilocos","text":"Ilocos Region is a region in the Philippines. Its regional center is San Fernando, La Union. The region has four provinces: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan.\nInhabitants are called \"Ilocanos\" and they speak the Ilocano language.\nThe term Ilocos Region is derived from this term. However, the designation of Ilocos as the basis of the name of the region promotes the wrong notion that all the residents of Region 1 are Ilocanos. Because 28% of the inhabitants are Pangasinan people, who belong to a different ethno-linguistic group from the Ilocanos.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":33},{"uri":"San_Fernando%2C_La_Union","surface_form":"San Fernando","offset":69},{"uri":"Provinces_of_the_Philippines","surface_form":"provinces","offset":113},{"uri":"Ilocos_Norte","surface_form":"Ilocos Norte","offset":124},{"uri":"Ilocos_Sur","surface_form":"Ilocos Sur","offset":138},{"uri":"La_Union","surface_form":"La Union","offset":150},{"uri":"Pangasinan","surface_form":"Pangasinan","offset":163},{"uri":"Iloko_language","surface_form":"Ilocano language","offset":228}]}
