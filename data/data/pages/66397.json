{"id":66397,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus","text":"The thymus is a specialized lymphoid organ of the immune system. The thymus is in front of the heart and behind the sternum.\nIn the thymus, T cells or T lymphocytes mature. T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders.\nThe thymus is where T cells develop from hematopoietic (blood-forming) cells. In addition, this is where the T cells get tolerant to cells of the body.\nThe thymus is largest and most active during the newborn and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the thymus begins to slow down. However, it continues to make lymphocytes throughout adult life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lymphatic_system","surface_form":"lymphoid","offset":28},{"uri":"Immune_system","surface_form":"immune system","offset":50},{"uri":"Heart","surface_form":"heart","offset":95},{"uri":"Sternum","surface_form":"sternum","offset":116},{"uri":"T_cell","surface_form":"T cell","offset":140},{"uri":"Lymphocyte","surface_form":"lymphocyte","offset":153},{"uri":"Adaptive_immune_system","surface_form":"adaptive immune system","offset":201},{"uri":"Adolescent","surface_form":"adolescent","offset":498},{"uri":"Lymphocytes","surface_form":"lymphocytes","offset":600}]}
