{"id":664299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active since 2012. It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. It was an extremely active and tragic season. With\u00A0a damage total of at least $282.16 billion (USD), it was the costliest\u00A0season on record. With over 3,300 deaths, 2017 was the deadliest season since 2005.\u00A0More than 99.7% of the season's damage was due to Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Nate, was the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history. Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate had their names retired due to their high damage costs and loss of life. Featuring 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, the 2017 season is the fifth active season.\nTropical Storm Arlene in April was the first storm of the season that formed on April 19. This was the third consecutive season in which storms form before the official start of the hurricane season.\u00A0In late August, Hurricane Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the first Category\u00A04 hurricane since Charley in 2004. It\u00A0also tied the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record along with the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the United States. In early September, Hurricane Irma became the first Category 5 hurricane to impact the northern Leeward Islands on record. It later hit the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane. Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. In late September, Hurricane Maria became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island of Dominica on record; and later it made landfall in Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. Most of the deaths from this season occurred from Maria, and caused a human crisis in Puerto Rico. In early October, Hurricane Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico while also becoming the fourth hurricane of the year to make landfall in the contiguous United States. Slightly over a week later, Hurricane Ophelia became the easternmost major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on record, and later impacted most of Northern Europe as an extratropical cyclone. The season ended with Tropical Storm Rina, which became post-tropical on November 9.\nStorm names.\nThe following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2017. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2023 season. This was the same list used in the 2011 season, with the exception of Irma which replaced Irene. Irma was previously used in 1978, and it's only used once as an Atlantic hurricane during this season.\nRetirement.\nOn April 11, 2018, the names \"Harvey\", \"Irma\", \"Maria\", and \"Nate\" were retired by the World Meteorological Organization due to the very expensive amount of damage and significant number of deaths they caused, and they will not be used again for a future Atlantic hurricane. They will be replaced with \"Harold\", \"Idalia\", \"Margot\", and \"Nigel\" for the 2023 season, respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2012_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2012","offset":74},{"uri":"Accumulated_Cyclone_Energy","surface_form":"extremely active","offset":146},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"USD","offset":231},{"uri":"2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2005","offset":336},{"uri":"Hurricane_Harvey","surface_form":"Harvey","offset":392},{"uri":"Hurricane_Irma","surface_form":"Irma","offset":400},{"uri":"Hurricane_Maria","surface_form":"Maria","offset":410},{"uri":"Hurricane_Nate","surface_form":"Nate","offset":417},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rican","offset":457},{"uri":"Hurricane_Harvey","surface_form":"Hurricane Harvey","offset":907},{"uri":"Hurricane_Wilma","surface_form":"Wilma","offset":1001},{"uri":"2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2005","offset":1010},{"uri":"Hurricane_Charley","surface_form":"Charley","offset":1056},{"uri":"2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2004","offset":1067},{"uri":"Hurricane_Irma","surface_form":"Hurricane Irma","offset":1243},{"uri":"Leeward_Islands","surface_form":"Leeward Islands","offset":1319},{"uri":"Florida_Keys","surface_form":"Florida Keys","offset":1363},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":1486},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":1505},{"uri":"Hurricane_Maria","surface_form":"Hurricane Maria","offset":1539},{"uri":"Dominica","surface_form":"Dominica","offset":1617},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":1667},{"uri":"Hurricane_Nate","surface_form":"Hurricane Nate","offset":1832},{"uri":"Continental_United_States","surface_form":"contiguous United States","offset":1982},{"uri":"Hurricane_Ophelia","surface_form":"Hurricane Ophelia","offset":2036},{"uri":"Northern_Europe","surface_form":"Northern Europe","offset":2153},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":2175},{"uri":"Hurricane_Irene","surface_form":"Irene","offset":2559},{"uri":"World_Meteorological_Organization","surface_form":"World Meteorological Organization","offset":2768},{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"Atlantic hurricane","offset":2936}]}
