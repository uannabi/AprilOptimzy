{"id":6643,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter","text":"Winter is one of the four seasons and the coldest time of the year. The days are shorter and the nights are longer. Winter comes after autumn and before spring.\nWinter begins at the winter solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually December 21 or December 22. In the Southern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually June 21 or June 22.\nSome animals hibernate during this season. In temperate climates there are no leaves on deciduous trees. People wear warm clothing and eat food that was grown earlier. Many places have snow in winter, and some people use sleds or skis. Holidays in winter for many countries include Christmas and New Year's Day.\nThe name comes from an old Germanic word that means \"time of water\" and refers to the\u00A0rain\u00A0and snow\u00A0of winter in middle and high latitudes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":26},{"uri":"Cold","surface_form":"cold","offset":42},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"autumn","offset":135},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":153},{"uri":"Solstice","surface_form":"solstice","offset":189},{"uri":"Northern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Northern Hemisphere","offset":206},{"uri":"December_21","surface_form":"December 21","offset":257},{"uri":"December_22","surface_form":"December 22","offset":272},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":292},{"uri":"June_21","surface_form":"June 21","offset":343},{"uri":"June_22","surface_form":"June 22","offset":354},{"uri":"Hibernate","surface_form":"hibernate","offset":376},{"uri":"Temperate_climate","surface_form":"temperate climate","offset":409},{"uri":"Leaves","surface_form":"leaves","offset":441},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":451},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":461},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":548},{"uri":"Sled","surface_form":"sled","offset":584},{"uri":"Ski","surface_form":"ski","offset":593},{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"Holiday","offset":599},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":645},{"uri":"New_Year%27s_Day","surface_form":"New Year's Day","offset":659},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":804}]}
