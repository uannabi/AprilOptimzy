The team was officially inscribed in the Somalia first league championship in 1952 as \"Lavori Publici FC/Genio\", winning the tournament of that year.\nThe team had a lot of followers who were native Somalis and so survived until 1990 when the Somali civil war started, while the antagonist AC Mogadiscio disappeared when Italy gave the independence to Somalia in 1960 (and nearly all the Italians of Somalia left the country).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian language","offset":46},{"uri":"Mogadishu","surface_form":"Mogadishu","offset":99},{"uri":"AC_Mogadiscio","surface_form":"AC Mogadiscio","offset":356}]}
