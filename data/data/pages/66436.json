This means that NATS makes sure aircraft can fly safely across Britain, and that aircraft can take-off and land safely at British airports.\nNATS is a private company, but the government owns 49%, just under half.\nBefore 2001 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) handled air traffic control.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Air_traffic_control","surface_form":"air traffic control","offset":105},{"uri":"Civil_Aviation_Authority","surface_form":"Civil Aviation Authority","offset":364}]}
