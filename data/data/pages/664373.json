He has directed 15 movies.\nBackground.\nHari was born in the Thoothukudi District of Tamil Nadu, India. His father, Gopal, is a vessels merchant.

Film critic Balaji commented that it was \"one of the few movies in recent times where a lot of importance seems to have been attached to the script. In spite of the flimsy story and routine screenplay where a youth grows to be a \"dada\", the dialogs elevate the quality of the movie and make it very enjoyable\". His second film \"Saamy\", under the Kavithaalaya banner, starred Vikram. It was named the year's biggest hit, grossing 160\u00A0million. Its success led to remakes; in Telugu (\"Lakshmi Narasimha\"), Kannada (\"Ayya\") and Hindi languages (\"Policegiri\").

Ayyappa Prasad from Nowrunning.com stated that Hari \"panders to the taste of his rural audience all the way, but the movie is bound to disappoint city-dwellers, since neither the story nor its treatment appeal to anyone with high IQ.\nIn 2010 Hari directed his tenth film \"Singam\", with Suriya, marking their third collaboration. although reviewers identified it as a standard masala entertainer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Action_movie","surface_form":"action","offset":77},{"uri":"Masala_film","surface_form":"masala film","offset":84},{"uri":"Tamil_cinema","surface_form":"Tamil cinema","offset":100},{"uri":"Thamizh","surface_form":"Thamizh","offset":158},{"uri":"Saamy","surface_form":"Saamy","offset":248},{"uri":"Kovil_(movie)","surface_form":"Kovil","offset":264},{"uri":"Ayya_(2005_Tamil_movie)","surface_form":"Ayya","offset":280},{"uri":"Thaamirabharani","surface_form":"Thaamirabharani","offset":295},{"uri":"Vel_(2007_movie)","surface_form":"Vel","offset":321},{"uri":"Singam_(movie_series)","surface_form":"Singam","offset":338},{"uri":"Thoothukudi_District","surface_form":"Thoothukudi District","offset":427},{"uri":"K._Natraj","surface_form":"K.
