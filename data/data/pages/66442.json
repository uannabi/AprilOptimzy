This was when the Czech Republic and the Slovakia were one country.\nThe company started flying \"domestically\" (only inside Czechoslovakia) in 1924. In 1930 they made their first international flight.\nCSA stopped flying between 1938 and 1945 when the country was occupied by Germany.\nWhen Czechoslovakia split into two countries, all of the Czechoslovak State Airlines stayed in the Czech Republic and became Czech Airlines.
