{"id":66450,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist","text":"e=\"preserve\">A protagonist is the main character of a story. It can be used for any kind of story: in literature, a movie, a television show or a play. The protagonist is also called the central character or main character and is often the hero of the story.\nProtagonists are usually moral and benevolent, helping other characters to change their badness to become good again, or defeating the bad characters. This is not always the case. For example, the protagonist in Psycho is a serial killer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":39},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"story","offset":54},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":102},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":116},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":125},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":240},{"uri":"Moral","surface_form":"moral","offset":284},{"uri":"Good","surface_form":"benevolent","offset":294},{"uri":"Defeat","surface_form":"defeat","offset":380},{"uri":"Villain","surface_form":"bad characters","offset":394},{"uri":"Psycho","surface_form":"Psycho","offset":471},{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"serial killer","offset":483}]}
