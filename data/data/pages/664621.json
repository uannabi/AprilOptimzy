{"id":664621,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov (, 30 January 1926 \u2013 19 August 1998) was a Soviet Navy officer. He is known for casting the single vote that prevented a Soviet nuclear strike (and, presumably, all-out nuclear war) during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Such an attack likely would have caused a major global thermonuclear response.\nNoam Chomsky said Arkhipov saved the world for his decision. He was a flotilla commander and second-in-command of the diesel powered submarine.\nArkhipov refused to authorize the captain's use of nuclear torpedoes against the United States Navy, a decision requiring the agreement of all three senior officers aboard. In 2002 Thomas Blanton, who was then director of the US National Security Archive, said that Arkhipov \"saved the world\".\nArkhipov died of kidney cancer on 19 August 1998 in Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Oblast at the age of 72.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soviet_Navy","surface_form":"Soviet Navy","offset":86},{"uri":"Cuban_Missile_Crisis","surface_form":"Cuban Missile Crisis","offset":236},{"uri":"Noam_Chomsky","surface_form":"Noam Chomsky","offset":337},{"uri":"Flotilla","surface_form":"flotilla","offset":407},{"uri":"Nuclear_torpedo","surface_form":"nuclear torpedo","offset":532},{"uri":"United_States_Navy","surface_form":"United States Navy","offset":562},{"uri":"National_Security_Archive","surface_form":"National Security Archive","offset":710},{"uri":"Kidney_cancer","surface_form":"kidney cancer","offset":792},{"uri":"Zheleznodorozhny%2C_Moscow_Oblast","surface_form":"Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Oblast","offset":827}]}
