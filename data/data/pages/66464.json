{"id":66464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocotyledon","text":"Monocotyledons are a class of flowering plants (angiosperms), whose embryo (seed) store only one cotyledon.\nThe APG II system recognises a clade called \"monocots\" but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank.\nYou can recognize a monocot by its leaves: they have long parallel veins running down the leaf. In contrast, dicot plant leaves have a complex netted vein pattern on their leaves.\nMonocots usually have a fibrous root system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Class_(biology)","surface_form":"class","offset":21},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":30},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":68},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":76},{"uri":"Cotyledon","surface_form":"cotyledon","offset":97},{"uri":"APG_II","surface_form":"APG II system","offset":112},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":139}]}
