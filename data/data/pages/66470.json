{"id":66470,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Campbell","text":"Glen Travis Campbell (April 22, 1936 \u2013 August 8, 2017) was an American musician, singer and actor. He was born in Billstown, Arkansas. Almost all of his solo works have been in the country music genre. Before his solo career, he played guitar on rock and pop music records, including \"Mary, Mary\" by The Monkees. Campbell joined The Beach Boys for a short time, when Brian Wilson became ill.\nCampbell guest-starred on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\". Later he hosted a series of his own, \"The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour\".\nCampbell's hits include \"Galveston\", \"By The Time I Get to Phoenix\", \"Wichita Lineman\", \"Try a Little Kindness\", \"Gentle On My Mind\", \"Sunflower\", and \"Hey Little One\". Many of his hits were written by Jimmy Webb. In 1975, Campbell had his biggest hit, \"Rhinestone Cowboy\". The song became a phenomenon, and rhinestone-covered clothing became a fad.\nCampbell had more hits, including \"Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L. A.)\" and \"Can You Fool?\". His career slowed down in the late 1970s. He seemed to suffer from public overexposure. His romance with Tanya Tucker, a much younger country singer, did not help the way many people saw Campbell. He stopped recording, and cut back on his public appearances.\nYears later, Campbell returned to recording and appearing on television. In the 1990s, people were again interested in his music and career. Personal problems, though, seemed to get as much attention as his career, for example, when Campbell was arrested for drunk driving. His music is still popular with fans, and is part of popular culture.\nCampbell discovered in late 2010 that he had Alzheimer's disease. He announced the diagnosis in June 2011. He released his final album that year. He completed his last concert tour in November 2012. He died of the disease on August 8, 2017 in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 81.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":62},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":71},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":81},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":92},{"uri":"Billstown%2C_Arkansas","surface_form":"Billstown, Arkansas","offset":114},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":181},{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":195},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":236},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":246},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop music","offset":255},{"uri":"Vinyl_record","surface_form":"records","offset":265},{"uri":"The_Monkees","surface_form":"The Monkees","offset":300},{"uri":"The_Beach_Boys","surface_form":"The Beach Boys","offset":329},{"uri":"Brian_Wilson","surface_form":"Brian Wilson","offset":367},{"uri":"Smothers_Brothers","surface_form":"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour","offset":419},{"uri":"Television_host","surface_form":"hosted","offset":464},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"series","offset":473},{"uri":"Hit_record","surface_form":"hits","offset":538},{"uri":"Jimmy_Webb","surface_form":"Jimmy Webb","offset":729},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":819},{"uri":"Rhinestone","surface_form":"rhinestone","offset":835},{"uri":"Trend","surface_form":"fad","offset":872},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"L.
