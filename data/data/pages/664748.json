{"id":664748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosome_complex","text":"The exosome complex is a protein complex which can degrade RNA strands (~stop them working). In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus.\nThe core of the complex has a ring structure consisting of six proteins that all belong to the same class of RNases, the 'RNase PH-like proteins'.\nExosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea. In bacteria a simpler complex called the \"degradosome\" carries out similar functions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":25},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":59},{"uri":"Eukaryote","surface_form":"eukaryotic cells","offset":96},{"uri":"Cytoplasm","surface_form":"cytoplasm","offset":152},{"uri":"Nucleus","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":163},{"uri":"Nucleolus","surface_form":"nucleolus","offset":191},{"uri":"RNase","surface_form":"RNase","offset":311},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":406},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":418}]}
