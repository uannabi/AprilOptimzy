{"id":664778,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Honor_Society","text":"The National Honor Society (NHS) is a nationwide organization for high school students in the United States which is made up of many chapters in high schools.\nSelection is based on four criteria: scholarship (academic achievement), leadership, service, and character. The National Honor Society requires some sort of service to the community, school, or other organizations. The time spent working on these projects contributes towards the monthly service hour requirement.\nThe National Honor Society was founded in 1921 by the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The Alpha chapter of NHS was founded at Fifth Avenue High School by Principal Edward S. Rynearson in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":94},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":145},{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":196},{"uri":"Leadership","surface_form":"leadership","offset":232},{"uri":"Selfless_service","surface_form":"service","offset":244},{"uri":"Moral_character","surface_form":"character","offset":257},{"uri":"National_Association_of_Secondary_School_Principals","surface_form":"National Association of Secondary School Principals","offset":528},{"uri":"Fifth_Avenue_High_School","surface_form":"Fifth Avenue High School","offset":621},{"uri":"Pittsburgh","surface_form":"Pittsburgh","offset":682},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":694}]}
