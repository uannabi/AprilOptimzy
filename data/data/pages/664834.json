{"id":664834,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doodle","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Google Doodle is a special, temporary logo on Google's homepages that celebrates holidays, events, achievements, and notable historical figures. The first Google Doodle honored the Burning Man festival in 1998, and was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\nFuture Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor until 2000, when Page and Brin asked public relations officer Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day. Since then, a team of employees called Doodlers have organized and published the Doodles.\nBy 2014, Google had published over 2,000 regional and international Doodles throughout its homepages, often featuring guest artists, musicians, and personalities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":61},{"uri":"Home_page","surface_form":"homepage","offset":70},{"uri":"Holiday","surface_form":"holiday","offset":96},{"uri":"Doodle","surface_form":"Doodle","offset":177},{"uri":"Burning_Man","surface_form":"Burning Man","offset":196},{"uri":"Larry_Page","surface_form":"Larry Page","offset":246},{"uri":"Sergey_Brin","surface_form":"Sergey Brin","offset":261},{"uri":"Public_relations_officer","surface_form":"public relations officer","offset":372},{"uri":"Dennis_Hwang","surface_form":"Dennis Hwang","offset":397},{"uri":"Bastille_Day","surface_form":"Bastille Day","offset":431}]}
