He said \"The Tea Party is what the Republican Party should have always been\".\nBlum favors getting rid of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In 2017, he didn't support the original version of the American Health Care Act of 2017, or Trumpcare. Trumpcare was the Republicans' bill to get rid of and replace Obamacare. Blum said the original Trumpcare didn't do enough to lower premiums for hard-working Americans.\nAs of November 1, 2018, Blum was under investigation by the United States House Ethics Committee Committee. That's because he might have violated certain ethics rules. He might have done so by not disclosing his ownership of a digital marketing company, Tin Moon.\nBlum was born in Dubuque, Iowa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":53},{"uri":"Businessperson","surface_form":"businessman","offset":62},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":78},{"uri":"United_States_Representative","surface_form":"United States Representative","offset":103},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":170},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":186},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":372},{"uri":"Monica_Vernon","surface_form":"Monica Vernon","offset":381},{"uri":"Tea_Party_movement","surface_form":"Tea Party Republican","offset":482},{"uri":"Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act","surface_form":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","offset":613},{"uri":"American_Health_Care_Act_of_2017","surface_form":"American Health Care Act of 2017","offset":724},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"Americans","offset":930},{"uri":"Dubuque%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"Dubuque, Iowa","offset":1222}]}
