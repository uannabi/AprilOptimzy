{"id":66498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal","text":"e=\"preserve\">The decimal numeral system is the most usual way of writing numbers. It has ten as a starting point, or base. It is sometimes called the base ten or denary numeral system. The word \"decimal\" is also used instead of the word \"period\" to mean the dot (\".\") that is sometimes used to separate the positions of the numbers in this system. Indeed, the dot is the default decimal separator in English-speaking countries.\nDecimal notation.\nDecimal notation is the writing of numbers in the base-ten numeral system, which uses various symbols (called digits) for no more than ten distinct values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) to represent any numbers, no matter how large. These digits are often used with a decimal separator(such as \".\" or \",\"), which indicates the start of a fractional part, and with one of the sign symbols + (positive) or \u2212 (negative) in front of the numerals to indicate sign.\nThere are only two truly positional decimal systems in ancient civilization: the Chinese counting rods system and Hindu-Arabic numeral system. Both required no more than ten symbols, while other numeral systems, such as Babylonian base-60 system, require more symbols.\nOther rational numbers.\nAny rational number can be expressed as a unique decimal expansion. It may have to end with recurring decimals.\nNatural languages.\nA straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as \"ten-one\" and 23 as \"two-ten-three\", is found in Chinese languages except Wu, and in Vietnamese with a few irregularities. Japanese, Korean, and Thai have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for teens and decades.\nIncan languages such as Quechua and Aymara have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as \"ten with one\" and 23 as \"two-ten with three\".\nSome psychologists suggest irregularities of numerals in a language may hinder children's counting ability.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numeral_system","surface_form":"numeral system","offset":25},{"uri":"10_(number)","surface_form":"ten","offset":89},{"uri":"Base_(mathematics)","surface_form":"base","offset":117},{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":340},{"uri":"Decimal_separator","surface_form":"decimal separator","offset":379},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":481},{"uri":"Numeral_system","surface_form":"numeral system","offset":505},{"uri":"Numerical_digit","surface_form":"digits","offset":556},{"uri":"Decimal_separator","surface_form":"decimal separator","offset":717},{"uri":"Counting_rods","surface_form":"Chinese counting rods","offset":990},{"uri":"Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system","surface_form":"Hindu-Arabic numeral system","offset":1023},{"uri":"Sexagesimal","surface_form":"Babylonian base-60 system","offset":1129},{"uri":"Rational_number","surface_form":"rational number","offset":1206},{"uri":"Recurring_decimal","surface_form":"recurring decimal","offset":1294},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese language","offset":1444},{"uri":"Wu_(linguistics)","surface_form":"Wu","offset":1469},{"uri":"Vietnamese_language","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":1480},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1518},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":1528},{"uri":"Thai_language","surface_form":"Thai","offset":1540},{"uri":"Quechua","surface_form":"Quechua","offset":1696},{"uri":"Aymara_language","surface_form":"Aymara","offset":1708}]}
