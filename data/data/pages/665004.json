{"id":665004,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer","text":"e=\"preserve\">Genderqueer is a catch-all category for gender identities that are not only relating to masculine or feminine identities which are outside the gender binary and cisnormativity. Genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their gender expression.\nGender identity is separate from sexual or romantic orientation, and genderqueer people have a variety of sexual orientations, just as transgender and cisgender people do.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Masculine","surface_form":"masculine","offset":101},{"uri":"Feminine","surface_form":"feminine","offset":114},{"uri":"Gender_binary","surface_form":"gender binary","offset":156},{"uri":"Cisgender","surface_form":"cisnormativity","offset":174},{"uri":"Gender_variance","surface_form":"gender expression","offset":287},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual","offset":339},{"uri":"Romantic_orientation","surface_form":"romantic orientation","offset":349},{"uri":"Cisgender","surface_form":"cisgender","offset":457}]}
