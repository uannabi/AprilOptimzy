{"id":66517,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty","text":"=\"preserve\">Loyalty is a devotion for someone or something. Someone who is loyal can be trusted, because they never betray the people they are loyal to.\nLoyalty in business.\nBeing loyal can also bring good to business because the boss, or person in control, may let the person do something difficult but greatly paid. This is because loyal people are expected and trusted to behave responsibly.\nSome firms (e.g. insurance brokers) may give \"loyalty discounts\" to customers who stay with them for a long time (who are loyal to the firm). Some stores may offer their customers \"loyalty cards\" to get some money off their purchases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Devotion","surface_form":"devotion","offset":25},{"uri":"Trust","surface_form":"trusted","offset":88},{"uri":"Betrayal","surface_form":"betray","offset":116},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":209},{"uri":"Boss","surface_form":"boss","offset":230},{"uri":"Great","surface_form":"great","offset":304},{"uri":"Payment","surface_form":"paid","offset":312},{"uri":"Expectation","surface_form":"expected","offset":351},{"uri":"Trust_(social_sciences)","surface_form":"trusted","offset":364},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behave","offset":375},{"uri":"Responsibility","surface_form":"responsibly","offset":382},{"uri":"Insurance","surface_form":"insurance","offset":412},{"uri":"Broker","surface_form":"broker","offset":422},{"uri":"Customer","surface_form":"customer","offset":463},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"stores","offset":542}]}
