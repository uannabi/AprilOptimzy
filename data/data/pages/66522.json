{"id":66522,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAC","text":"e=\"preserve\">AAC is a file format for storing music or other sounds. It stands for Advanced Audio Coding or Advanced Audio Codec. It is used by Apple Inc. in the iPod and iTunes. AAC is one of the standard formats that comes from the MPEG organization, the same people who invented MP3.\nFile names.\nAn AAC file that has only music and information could have a name that ends with either.m4a or.mp4.\nMetadata.\nA KDE/Qt application for Linux/Unix called easytag will edit metadata about AAC-encoded files as long as they end with the.m4a extension. Typically, renaming files to.m4a and back to the original extension after editing is sufficient. This method can be used to configure typical ID3v2 metadata including cover art. This cover art is used by Apple's iTunes and their media players. Note that easytag does not have the ability to add chapter points into Audiobooks (.m4b).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple Inc.","offset":144},{"uri":"IPod","surface_form":"iPod","offset":162},{"uri":"ITunes","surface_form":"iTunes","offset":171},{"uri":"MPEG","surface_form":"MPEG","offset":234},{"uri":"MP3","surface_form":"MP3","offset":282},{"uri":"Easytag","surface_form":"easytag","offset":452},{"uri":"ID3v2","surface_form":"ID3v2","offset":689},{"uri":"ITunes","surface_form":"iTunes","offset":759}]}
