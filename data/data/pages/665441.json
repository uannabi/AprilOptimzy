{"id":665441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop","text":"A Hyperloop is a proposed type of train that would travel at very high speeds. The reason it can travel so fast is because it is inside a tube with no air. This vacuum means that there will be no friction to slow the train.\nThe Hyperloop is being created and tested in various places around the world, for example the United States, the Middle East and Asia.\nIn 2012, Elon Musk (Tesla Motors, SpaceX) proposed this technology. In 2013, he put a plan online that showed the hyperloop train taking 35 minutes to go between San Francisco and Los Angeles in the United States. He shared this technology to the world. In 2015, Musk's company built a test tube. He asked universities and companies to make the test trains. They had two competitions in 2017 to see how fast the hyperloop trains could travel. The fastest test was.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":34},{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":161},{"uri":"Friction","surface_form":"friction","offset":196},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":318},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":337},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":353},{"uri":"Elon_Musk","surface_form":"Elon Musk","offset":368},{"uri":"Tesla_Motors","surface_form":"Tesla Motors","offset":379},{"uri":"SpaceX","surface_form":"SpaceX","offset":393},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":521},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":539}]}
