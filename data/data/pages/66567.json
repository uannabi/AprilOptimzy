{"id":66567,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_row","text":"=\"preserve\">On a QWERTY keyboard, the letters \"ASDFGHJKL\" and the semicolon (;) are called the home row, or sometimes the home keys.\nStructure.\nThe home keys A, S, D, F, J, K, L and semicolon are where the fingers are placed, with both thumbs resting on the space bar. The pinkies (plural of pinky) go on the A and; keys, the ring fingers (fingers closest to the pinkies) on S and L, middle fingers on D and K, and the index fingers (those closest to the thumb) on F and J. Some computers have little bumps on the F and J letters to help the user tell where the home keys are. When the fingers are placed on the home keys, almost every key should be reachable from that position.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"QWERTY","surface_form":"QWERTY","offset":17},{"uri":"Semicolon","surface_form":"semicolon","offset":66},{"uri":"Thumb","surface_form":"thumb","offset":236},{"uri":"Space_bar","surface_form":"space bar","offset":258}]}
