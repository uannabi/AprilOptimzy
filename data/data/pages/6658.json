{"id":6658,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Hidalgo","text":"Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (8 May, 1753 \u2013 30 July, 1811) was a Mexican priest. He started Mexico's war of independence against Spain.\nHidalgo made a speech in 1810 now called the Grito de Dolores. He called on the people to support the King of Spain against the rebellious Viceroy of Mexico. After a few months he was taken prisoner and executed by firing squad. After he died, several other people, such as Vicente Guerrero, kept fighting against the Spanish until 1821, when Mexico became an independent country. Hidalgo is remembered today as a great liberator in Mexico.\nThe Mexican state of Hidalgo is named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":62},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":70},{"uri":"Mexican_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"Mexico's war of independence","offset":89},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":126},{"uri":"1810","surface_form":"1810","offset":158},{"uri":"Grito_de_Dolores","surface_form":"Grito de Dolores","offset":178},{"uri":"Prisoner","surface_form":"prisoner","offset":323},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"executed","offset":336},{"uri":"Firing_squad","surface_form":"firing squad","offset":348},{"uri":"Vicente_Guerrero","surface_form":"Vicente Guerrero","offset":407},{"uri":"Hidalgo_(state)","surface_form":"Hidalgo","offset":595}]}
