{"id":665813,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel","text":"=\"preserve\">A pastel is an art colour in the form of a stick. It is made of pure powdered pigment and a 'binder' which holds it together. Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance.\nThe pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all kinds of coloured art. The effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process. Chalk may be added to the pastel to tone down the more vivd colours.\nAn artwork made using pastels is called a pastel, pastel drawing or pastel painting. As an adjective the word 'pastel' means pale in colour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":27},{"uri":"Pigment","surface_form":"pigment","offset":90},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":182},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":541}]}
