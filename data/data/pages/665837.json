Solicitors general in different countries may have different jobs or powers. Usually, the solicitor general is the government's lawyer.\nIn the United States, the solicitor general is the government's lawyer in Supreme Court cases. Congress created the job in the 1870s. About two thirds of the cases in the Supreme Court involve the government. The solicitor general does not always argue them personally. He or she can send an assistant or other government lawyer to do it. When the government loses a case in the lower court, the solicitor general decides whether or not to appeal it and make it a Supreme Court case.\nIn Australia, the solicitor general also acts as the government's lawyer and represents the country in international cases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Common_law","surface_form":"common law","offset":54},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":216},{"uri":"Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"solicitor general","offset":235},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Supreme Court cases","offset":283},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"Congress","offset":304},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":696}]}
