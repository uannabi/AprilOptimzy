{"id":6663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"Explosives that explode when they are hit are also called mine; Two common types are Land mines and Naval mines.\"\nMining is the process of digging things out of the ground. Any material that cannot be grown must be mined. Mining things from the ground is called \"extraction\". Mining can include extraction of metals and minerals, like coal, diamond, gold, silver, platinum, copper, tin and iron. Mining can also include other things like oil and natural gas.\nSome mining is done by scraping away the soil (dirt) from the top of the ground. This is called \"surface mining\". Some mining is done by going deep underground into a \"mine shaft\". This is called \"underground mining\". Some mining, such as gold mining, is done in other ways. Gold can be mined by searching in the bed of a river or other stream of water to remove the flakes of gold. This is called \"panning\" or \"placer mining\".\nA worker in a mine is called a miner. Underground mining is a dangerous job. Many mines have accidents. Hundreds of miners die every year from accidents, mostly in poor countries. Safety rules and special safety equipment is used to try and protect miners from accidents. Underground coal mining is especially dangerous because coal can give off poisonous and explosive gases.\nSome towns are mining towns. People live there because they can make money as miners or by doing things for miners. When mining stops the town may become a ghost town.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Explosives","surface_form":"Explosives","offset":15},{"uri":"Land_mine","surface_form":"Land mine","offset":100},{"uri":"Naval_mine","surface_form":"Naval mine","offset":115},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":192},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":324},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":335},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":350},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":356},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":365},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":371},{"uri":"Platinum","surface_form":"platinum","offset":379},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":389},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":453},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"natural gas","offset":461},{"uri":"Surface_mining","surface_form":"surface mining","offset":571},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":796},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":821},{"uri":"Worker","surface_form":"worker","offset":904},{"uri":"Danger","surface_form":"dangerous","offset":964},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"job","offset":974},{"uri":"Accident","surface_form":"accident","offset":995},{"uri":"Equipment","surface_form":"equipment","offset":1114},{"uri":"Coal_mining","surface_form":"coal mining","offset":1186},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":1230},{"uri":"Ghost_town","surface_form":"ghost town","offset":1435}]}
