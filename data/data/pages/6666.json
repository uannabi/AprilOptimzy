They are more muscular and aggressive than the female of the species, the cow. The bull has long been an important symbol in many cultures, and plays a large role in beef ranching, dairy farming. They are also important in other cultural activities, including bull fighting and bull riding. The management of livestock animals in hot climates is a challenge. The physiological and behavioral changes induced in these animals compromise their welfare, breeding, health, and zootechnical performance, resulting in final products (eggs, milk, and meat) with unsatisfactory characteristics.\nAs with other animals, some bulls have been regarded as pets.\nReferences.\nThe bull semen market is very lucrative. Animal agriculture forcefully breeds animals to have what it considers the best traits for food production. In 2011, the U.S. exported $124.7 million worth of bull semen to other nations, representing 32 percent of the global market. In February 2019, an Angus bull named SAV America 8018 sold for the record-breaking price of $1.5 million due to \u201Csuperior genetics.\u201D\nA bull can live up to 18 - 22 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neutering","surface_form":"castrated","offset":31},{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":48},{"uri":"Bos_taurus","surface_form":"Bos taurus","offset":69},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":156},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":248},{"uri":"Ranching","surface_form":"ranching","offset":253},{"uri":"Dairy_farming","surface_form":"dairy farming","offset":263},{"uri":"Bull_fighting","surface_form":"bull fighting","offset":342},{"uri":"Bull_riding","surface_form":"bull riding","offset":360},{"uri":"Pets","surface_form":"pets","offset":725}]}
