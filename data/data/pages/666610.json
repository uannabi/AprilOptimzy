{"id":666610,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Yangtze_River_Bridge","text":"The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a 4-lane steel bridge in Nanjing that crosses the Yangtze River. It has two levels. The top level is a road for cars, buses, and trucks. There is also a sidewalk for people on foot. That part is 4588 meters or 15,052 feet long. The bottom level is a railroad for trains. That part is 6772 meters or 22,218 feet long.\nIt is owned, paid for, and fixed by Nanjing's government and by the Shanghai Railway Bureau.\nName.\nThe Mandarin Chinese name of the bridge is \"N\u00E1nj\u012Bng Ch\u00E1ngji\u0101ng D\u00E0qi\u00E1o\", which means \"the Big Bridge across the Long River in the Southern Capital\". (\"Ch\u00E1ngji\u0101ng\" or \"Long River\" is the Chinese name for the Yangtze River, and \"Nanjing\" means \"Southern Capital\".) It is written in the traditional characters used by Chinese people on Taiwan and in Hong Kong and in the simplified characters used by mainland China.\nHistory.\nThe Yangtze River is very big and very wide. During wars, people sometimes made pontoon bridges out of many boats. Most of the time, to go from one side to the other, people needed to use a ferry. This made things pretty slow and slowed the growth of China's economy.\nThe Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was started in 1960. Both parts were finished and opened for use in late 1968. It was the 3rd bridge across the Yangtze River, after Wuhan's bridge and the Baishatuo Bridge near Chongqing. It is still important and a landmark in Nanjing because it was the first big bridge designed and built completely by Chinese people. It also has poems and sayings by Mao Zedong and art from the Cultural Revolution.\nIt is also infamous as the place with the most known suicides in the world. More than 2000 people have jumped off of the bridge since it was opened.\nTransport.\nThe road across the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is National Highway 104. The same road is also part of highways 205 and 312.\nThe railroad across the bridge is the Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway. (This is the railroad for slow trains. The high-speed trains between Beijing and Shanghai use a different bridge.) The same railroad is also part of the Nanjing\u2013Xi'an and Nanjing\u2013Qidong Railways. It is also used for the Shanghai\u2013Chengdu High-Speed Railway, but those trains can't go very fast across the bridge.\nArt.\nThe bridge was constructed under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. It is covered with his sayings and calligraphy (artistic handwriting). It also has statues and pictures of strong and passionate soldiers, workers, and farmers that go along with what the words say. There are also pictures of China's growing industry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Steel","surface_form":"steel","offset":45},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":51},{"uri":"Nanjing","surface_form":"Nanjing","offset":61},{"uri":"Yangtze_River","surface_form":"Yangtze River","offset":86},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":139},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":148},{"uri":"Bus","surface_form":"bus","offset":154},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":165},{"uri":"Sidewalk","surface_form":"sidewalk","offset":189},{"uri":"Walking","surface_form":"on foot","offset":209},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":236},{"uri":"Foot_(unit)","surface_form":"feet","offset":253},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":286},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":299},{"uri":"Shanghai_Railway_Bureau","surface_form":"Shanghai Railway Bureau","offset":421},{"uri":"Mandarin_Chinese","surface_form":"Mandarin Chinese","offset":456},{"uri":"Yangtze_River","surface_form":"Yangtze River","offset":658},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"Capital","offset":703},{"uri":"Traditional_characters","surface_form":"traditional characters","offset":735},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":784},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":798},{"uri":"Simplified_characters","surface_form":"simplified characters","offset":819},{"uri":"Mainland_China","surface_form":"mainland China","offset":849},{"uri":"Yangtze_River","surface_form":"Yangtze River","offset":878},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":926},{"uri":"Pontoon_bridge","surface_form":"pontoon bridge","offset":954},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":982},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":1064},{"uri":"PRC","surface_form":"China","offset":1125},{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":1133},{"uri":"Wuhan","surface_form":"Wuhan","offset":1308},{"uri":"Wuhan_Yangtze_River_Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":1316},{"uri":"Baishatuo_Yangtze_River_Railway_Bridge","surface_form":"Baishatuo Bridge","offset":1331},{"uri":"Chongqing","surface_form":"Chongqing","offset":1353},{"uri":"Landmark","surface_form":"landmark","offset":1392},{"uri":"Chinese_people","surface_form":"Chinese people","offset":1481},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":1509},{"uri":"Saying","surface_form":"saying","offset":1519},{"uri":"Mao_Zedong","surface_form":"Mao Zedong","offset":1530},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":1545},{"uri":"Cultural_Revolution","surface_form":"Cultural Revolution","offset":1558},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":1632},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":1743},{"uri":"China_National_Highway_104","surface_form":"National Highway 104","offset":1791},{"uri":"China_National_Highway_205","surface_form":"205","offset":1852},{"uri":"China_National_Highway_312","surface_form":"312","offset":1860},{"uri":"Railroad","surface_form":"railroad","offset":1869},{"uri":"Beijing%E2%80%93Shanghai_Railway","surface_form":"Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway","offset":1903},{"uri":"High-speed_train","surface_form":"high-speed train","offset":1972},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":1998},{"uri":"Shanghai","surface_form":"Shanghai","offset":2010},{"uri":"Dashengguan_Yangtze_River_Bridge","surface_form":"a different bridge","offset":2023},{"uri":"Nanjing%E2%80%93Xi%27an_Railway","surface_form":"Nanjing\u2013Xi'an","offset":2082},{"uri":"Nanjing%E2%80%93Qidong_Railway","surface_form":"Nanjing\u2013Qidong Railway","offset":2100},{"uri":"Shanghai%E2%80%93Chengdu_High-Speed_Railway","surface_form":"Shanghai\u2013Chengdu High-Speed Railway","offset":2149},{"uri":"Mao_Zedong","surface_form":"Chairman Mao Zedong","offset":2297},{"uri":"Calligraphy","surface_form":"calligraphy","offset":2353},{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statue","offset":2401},{"uri":"Engraving","surface_form":"picture","offset":2413},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":2447},{"uri":"Worker","surface_form":"worker","offset":2457},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":2470},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":2560}]}
