They ended the regular season with a record of 11 wins, 1 loss, and 2 ties. This was the same record the Los Angeles Rams achieved. Since the Rams were in the same division,\u00A0the Colts lost the tie based on point differential in head-to-head games and thus did not make the playoffs.\nThe Colts' win percentage of.917 (The NFL did not count ties for such purposes until 1972) is the best in North American pro sports history for a team that did not make the playoffs\nStandings.\nNote: Tie games were not counted in the standings until 1972.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baltimore_Colts","surface_form":"Baltimore Colts","offset":9},{"uri":"Indianapolis_Colts_seasons","surface_form":"season","offset":25},{"uri":"National_Football_League","surface_form":"National Football League","offset":72}]}
