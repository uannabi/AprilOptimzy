{"id":666822,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumori","text":"Pumori () (or Pumo Ri) is a mountain on the Nepal-Tibet border. It is in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayas. Pumori lies just eight kilometres west of Mount Everest. Pumori means \"the Mountain Daughter\" in Sherpa language. It was named by George Mallory. \"Pumo\" means young girl or daughter and \"Ri\" means mountain in Sherpa language. Climbers sometimes refer to Pumori as \"Everest's Daughter\". Mallory also called it Clare Peak, after his daughter.\nPumori is a popular climbing peak. The easiest route is graded class 3, but avalanche is still a danger. Pumori was first climbed on May 17, 1962 by Gerhard Lenser on a German-Swiss expedition. Two Czechs (Leopold Sulovsk\u00FD and Zden\u011Bk Michalec) climbed a new route on the south face in the spring of 1996.\nAn outlier of Pumori is Kala Patthar (5,643m/18,513'). It appears as a brown bump below the south face of Pumori. Many trekkers going to see Mount Everest up close will try to climb to the top of Kala Patthar.\nTrekking and mountaineering.\nNearly 500 people had reached the summit of Pumori by 2005. 42 (13 after reaching the summit) people lost their lives while climbing by 2005. It's popularity increased by 2008. From the summit, high Tibetan plateau can be seen on the one side and Nepal can be seen on the other side. The western part of the Everest can also be seen from the summit. However, there have been some dangers from avalanches. Some Spanish climbing teams took heavy losses (such as in 1989 and 2001). 2015 avalanche killed and injured many people. It was likely caused by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. It is said to have started from the Pumori-Lingtren ridge.\nIn 1982 a group climbing to Pumori also did a ski-hike around Everest. Jim Bridwell led the climbing expedition to Pumori.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":28},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":44},{"uri":"Tibet","surface_form":"Tibet","offset":50},{"uri":"Mahalangur_Himal","surface_form":"Mahalangur","offset":77},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":103},{"uri":"Mount_Everest","surface_form":"Mount Everest","offset":156},{"uri":"Sherpa_language","surface_form":"Sherpa language","offset":211},{"uri":"George_Mallory","surface_form":"George Mallory","offset":244},{"uri":"Sherpa_language","surface_form":"Sherpa language","offset":323},{"uri":"Yosemite_Decimal_System","surface_form":"class 3","offset":518},{"uri":"Avalanche","surface_form":"avalanche","offset":531},{"uri":"Gerhard_Lenser","surface_form":"Gerhard Lenser","offset":604},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":624},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":631},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":637},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czechs","offset":653},{"uri":"Inliers_and_outliers_(geology)","surface_form":"outlier","offset":763},{"uri":"Kala_Patthar","surface_form":"Kala Patthar","offset":784},{"uri":"Bump","surface_form":"bump","offset":837},{"uri":"Trekking","surface_form":"trekkers","offset":879},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summit","offset":1033},{"uri":"Tibetan_plateau","surface_form":"Tibetan plateau","offset":1198},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injured","offset":1504},{"uri":"April_2015_Nepal_earthquake","surface_form":"2015 Nepal earthquake","offset":1553},{"uri":"Jim_Bridwell","surface_form":"Jim Bridwell","offset":1706}]}
