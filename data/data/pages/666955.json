{"id":666955,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford_assassination_attempt_in_Sacramento","text":"On September 5, 1975, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a cult member of Charles Manson's Manson Family, attempted to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California.\nFromme wanted to make a statement to people who did not want to stop environmental pollution. Although Fromme stood a little more than an arm's length from Ford that Friday morning and pointed a M1911 pistol at him, her gun failed to fire and no one was injured.\nAfter the assassination attempt, Ford continued to walk to the California state house, where he met with Jerry Brown. For her crime, Fromme spent 34 years in prison and was released on August 14, 2009 \u2013 two years after Ford's death.\nThe Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, later received the M1911 pistol used in the assassination attempt as a gift, and the gun was put on display.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lynette_Fromme","surface_form":"Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme","offset":22},{"uri":"Charles_Manson","surface_form":"Charles Manson's","offset":65},{"uri":"Manson_Family","surface_form":"Manson Family","offset":82},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States President","offset":122},{"uri":"Gerald_Ford","surface_form":"Gerald Ford","offset":146},{"uri":"Sacramento%2C_California","surface_form":"Sacramento, California","offset":161},{"uri":"Environmental_pollution","surface_form":"environmental pollution","offset":254},{"uri":"M1911_pistol","surface_form":"M1911 pistol","offset":380},{"uri":"Jerry_Brown","surface_form":"Jerry Brown","offset":553},{"uri":"Gerald_R._Ford_Presidential_Museum","surface_form":"Gerald R.
