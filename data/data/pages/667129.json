Davis' had six major collections, the last shown at Manhattan restaurant Caffe Roma.\nBeginnings.\n[https://suny-fit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?context=L&vid=01SUNY_FIT:01SUNY_FIT&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&docid=alma991674600004829 \"Karl Davis\" \u201CDesigner Files\u201D] archival materials at [https://www.fitnyc.edu/ Fashion Institute of Technology]\u2019s research library reveal that during his teen years Davis was taught by a friend\u2019s mother how to operate a sewing machine, and that when he was fifteen years old, he for the first time made classic, pleated slacks for himself. Davis graduated from high school in August 1980. At age 17, he left Brooklyn and began designing.\nDavis attended New York\u2019s [https://www.fitnyc.edu/ Fashion Institute of Technology] for only one semester - six months - and while there studied pattern making. He then worked as an assistant to Carol Fertig and, too, as a freelance design assistant to Bill Blass. It was while Davis was working as design assistant that he sold first styles to Henri Bendel.\nDuring 1984, Davis established his own collection. Initially, he was financed by his supportive, fashionable mother - Rose.\nFashion Designer.\nThough brief \u2013 from age 17 until shortly before his death at age 25 \u2013 Karl Davis experienced a career highly praised and of impressive achievement\n\"Newsweek\" (10 August 1987) observed that Davis created an exclusive line of classic women\u2019s clothing, which \"New York Newsday\" (4 May 1986) described as grown-up clothes not for those on a tight budget.\n\"New York Magazine\" stated that ladies dressed in Davis-designed wardrobes would look \u201Cstrong, confident, and elegant \u2013 not to mention, in many instances, frankly sexy\u201D.\nFashion columnists of the \"Dallas Morning News\" (18 December 1985) reported that Davis\u2019s work was strongly influenced by the great masters of couture, but that he managed to move forward, adding his own signature of modern minimalism; further stating that his approach to fashion and to his business were in remarkable contrast to his age.\n\"Taxi\" (November 1986) commented that being young and having no financial backing did not intimidate Davis from creating couture clothing of the highest level; that respect should be paid to him and fashion magazine should acknowledge him and take the initiative to put him on the map; and also that a lady dressed in Davis\u2019s clothes would not only be taken seriously, but would be praised for her good taste and silent elegance - daring to detach herself from the uniforms of a working machine. \"Taxi\" quoted Davis: \u201CI love what I\u2019m doing \u2013 making women look like women again! The lady I sell to is dressed femininely and still gains respect on a business level.\u201D \"Taxi\" further observed that a customer from Henri Bendel would never suspect that the dress she just purchased was from a young designer who supported himself by making bagel sandwiches in a downtown coffee shop.\nTrue, Davis did prepare sandwiches at \u201CTamala Designs With Bagel\u201D [153 Prince Street], a SoHo clothing store with food counter in the back owned by Aggie Markowitz who reflected \"[Karl] was an integral part of the downtown fashion mafia. He gave fashion commentary while he sort of made bagel sandwiches. The commentary usually came faster than the food\".\n\"Taxi\" (November 1986) quoted Davis: \u201CMost people would rather spend money on flashy clothes that scream and spell \u2018expensive\u2019, rather than purchasing understated elegant garments\".\n\"Pr\u00EAt\" (May 1986) said Davis was beginning to shake up the New York fashion scene with his elegant, dramatic cuts and sophisticated sense of style, that his designs were Inspired by the looks of Dior, Balenciaga and Chanel; and that he took a modern approach to the values and attitudes of Haute Couture and reinvented them for a new, younger generation. \"Pr\u00EAt\" additionally observed that Davis chose to work with very basic shapes and inject something hidden or unexpected into them which he described as \u201Cclassic with a twist\u201D; that he focused primarily on playing up and enhancing the feminine form; and that to further emphasize his attention to shape, he - with a keen focus on the waist and hips for both day and evening wear - tended to stay away from loud prints and patterns and designs.\nDuring December 1985, Davis found a backer and also was able to travel to Europe \u2013 both having significant impact on his May 1986 showing \u201CKarl Davis Fall 1986 Collection\u201D.\n\"New York Newsday\" (24 August 1986) declared Davis to be \u201CNew York\u2019s new crown prince of near couture\u201D.\n\"Karl Davis\" designs - priced at $80 to $500 wholesale - were sold In New York at Henri Bendel [which continued to be his major outlet], Bergdorf Goodman, Grand Hotel, Le Piccole, and Suzie's [Great Neck, NY]; in Dallas and Houston at Neiman Marcus; and in San Francisco at I.

He is very fond of fashion: it\u2019s as if he was born to enjoy wearing clothes. The clothes he wears are not shockingly avant-garde or showy. Karl is a unique dresser whose taste is classic, as well as modern, neat and refined. He creates his tasteful and sophisticated look by skillfully combining brand name clothes, antiques, and ordinary garments.\u201D\nTrue to his nature, Davis in1980 was voted \u201CBest Dressed Male\u201D of his George-Wingate-High-School [Brooklyn, NY] graduating class.\nIllness and Death.\nOn 2 May 1987, Karl Davis died of pneumonia at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY.
