The people were mostly Germans but they were expelled and replaced during wars.\nOne of the famous people from K\u00F6nigsberg was the philosopher Immanuel Kant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":16},{"uri":"Seaport","surface_form":"seaport","offset":67},{"uri":"Kaliningrad_Oblast","surface_form":"Kaliningrad Oblast","offset":108},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":132},{"uri":"Exclave","surface_form":"exclave","offset":140},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":156},{"uri":"Lithuania","surface_form":"Lithuania","offset":167},{"uri":"Baltic_Sea","surface_form":"Baltic Sea","offset":184},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":449},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":458},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":823},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":836},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainian","offset":858},{"uri":"East_Prussia","surface_form":"East Prussia","offset":956},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Duchy of Prussia","offset":982},{"uri":"Teutonic_Knights","surface_form":"Teutonic Knights","offset":1045},{"uri":"1254","surface_form":"1254","offset":1091},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":1099},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"Germans","offset":1128},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":1234},{"uri":"Immanuel_Kant","surface_form":"Immanuel Kant","offset":1246}]}
