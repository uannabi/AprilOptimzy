{"id":667372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arirang","text":"\"Arirang\" (;) is a Korean folk song. It is sometimes thought of as the unofficial national anthem of Korea. There are almost 3,600 variations for 60 versions of the song. All of these have a part of the song similar to \"Arirang, arirang, arariyo ()\". People think that the song is almost 600 years old.\n\"Arirang\" is on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list two times. This is because both South Korea and North Korea submitted the song for being included on the list. South Korea submitted the song in 2012 and North Korea submitted the song in 2014.\nOrigin.\nPeople think that \"Arirang\" came from Jeongseon in the Gangwon Province of South Korea. According to a legend, the song came from the story of a man and a woman who fell in love. This was while they were picking camellia flowers. In one version of the story, the man can't cross the Auraji river because the water is too high. Because of this, they sing a song to show how sorrowful they were. In the second version of the story, the man tries to cross the Auraji and drowns. In that version, he sings the song after he dies.\nAnother theory says that the song came from Lady Aryeong. It says that \"arin\" came from the Jurchen word for \"hometown\" and a Chinese song called \"Airang.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["intangible heritage","intangible heritage","Korean name"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":19},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk song","offset":26},{"uri":"Unofficial","surface_form":"unofficial","offset":71},{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":82},{"uri":"Variation","surface_form":"variations","offset":131},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":323},{"uri":"Intangible_cultural_heritage","surface_form":"Intangible Cultural Heritage","offset":330},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":396},{"uri":"North_Korea","surface_form":"North Korea","offset":412},{"uri":"Submit","surface_form":"submitted","offset":424},{"uri":"Jeongseon","surface_form":"Jeongseon","offset":604},{"uri":"Gangwon_Province%2C_South_Korea","surface_form":"Gangwon Province","offset":621},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":669},{"uri":"Camellia","surface_form":"camellia","offset":778},{"uri":"Sorrow","surface_form":"sorrow","offset":939},{"uri":"Drowning","surface_form":"drowns","offset":1034},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":1100},{"uri":"Lady_Aryeong","surface_form":"Lady Aryeong","offset":1136},{"uri":"Jurchen_language","surface_form":"Jurchen","offset":1184}]}
