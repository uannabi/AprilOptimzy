Building it used 1 ministry, 3 weis, 5 provinces, 28 prefectures, and 152 prefectures and counties. A total of 280,000 migrant workers made it using about 350 million urban bricks.\nIts gates include the Gate of China, the Zhongshan Gate, and the Xuanwu Gate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City_wall","surface_form":"city wall","offset":42},{"uri":"Nanjing","surface_form":"Nanjing","offset":55},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":64},{"uri":"Ming_Dynasty","surface_form":"Ming Dynasty","offset":108},{"uri":"Gate_of_China","surface_form":"Gate of China","offset":872},{"uri":"Zhongshan_Gate","surface_form":"Zhongshan Gate","offset":891},{"uri":"Xuanwu_Gate","surface_form":"Xuanwu Gate","offset":915}]}
