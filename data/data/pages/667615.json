{"id":667615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_German_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pennsylvania German (\"Deitsch\"; also called Pennsylvania Dutch) is a dialect of German spoken in the United States and Canada. Most speakers of Pennsylvania German are members of the Amish or Mennonite communities. About 350,000 people speak the dialect.\nHistory.\nThe ancestors of Pennsylvania German speakers mostly come from the Palatinate area in Germany. Other immigrants came from Switzerland, Swabia, Baden, and/or Alsace. These immigrants mostly settled in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. The Pennsylvania German dialect was widely spoken in Pennsylvania until the 20th century. The Amish and Mennonite communities continued to speak the dialect.\nKutztown University has a Pennsylvania German program, and offers a minor degree to students.\nDifferences with Standard German.\nPennsylvania German grammar is simpler than Standard German. The genitive case is lost, and adjective endings are simplified.\nThe sounds \u0153, \u00F8 (\u00F6) and y (\u00FC) in Standard German are not present in Pennsylvania German. So the word \"K\u00F6pfe\" (heads) becomes \"Kepp\" in the dialect. Also, \"K\u00FChe\" (cows) becomes \"Kieh\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":82},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":93},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":114},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":132},{"uri":"Amish","surface_form":"Amish","offset":196},{"uri":"Mennonites","surface_form":"Mennonite","offset":205},{"uri":"Palatinate_(region)","surface_form":"Palatinate","offset":344},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":363},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":399},{"uri":"Swabia","surface_form":"Swabia","offset":412},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Baden","surface_form":"Baden","offset":420},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":434},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":477},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":491},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":501},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":515},{"uri":"Amish","surface_form":"Amish","offset":625},{"uri":"Mennonites","surface_form":"Mennonite","offset":635},{"uri":"Kutztown_University_of_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Kutztown University","offset":689},{"uri":"Minor_(academic)","surface_form":"minor degree","offset":757},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":837},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"Standard German","offset":861},{"uri":"Genitive_case","surface_form":"genitive case","offset":882},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":909}]}
