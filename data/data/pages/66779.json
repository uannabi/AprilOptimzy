{"id":66779,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"The New Yorker\" is an American magazine that publishes articles, essays, stories, and cartoons about many topics. Though much of the magazine is about New York City, many readers are outside of the city. The magazine is known for its articles about politics, careful fact-checking, its cartoons, and short stories by many notable authors. It was founded by Harold Ross and the first issue was released on February 17, 1925. Though it was formerly a weekly magazine, it now publishes a new issue 47 times a year, with five longer two-week issues. In 2004, it had about 996,000 subscribers (people who paid to receive it).\nThe magazine has included short stories by J. D. Salinger, Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike, E. B. White, John Hersey, whose essay \"Hiroshima\" filled an entire issue, and Shirley Jackson, whose story \"The Lottery\" drew more mail than any other story published in the magazine.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":36},{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":45},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":165},{"uri":"Harold_Ross","surface_form":"Harold Ross","offset":371},{"uri":"February_17","surface_form":"February 17","offset":419},{"uri":"1925","surface_form":"1925","offset":432},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":563},{"uri":"J._D._Salinger","surface_form":"J.
