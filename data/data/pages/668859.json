Because of Tuvalu's constitution, the prime minister must always be a member of the Parliament, and is elected by parliament in a secret ballot.\nBecause there are no political parties in Tuvalu, any member of parliament can be nominated for the role. After the parliament vote, the Governor-General of Tuvalu must swear in the prime minister.\nThe office of prime minister was created when Tuvalu gained independence in 1978. Several former prime ministers have been appointed the Governor-General of Tuvalu.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":36},{"uri":"Tuvalu","surface_form":"Tuvalu","offset":58},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Tuvalu","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":150},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_Tuvalu","surface_form":"Governor-General of Tuvalu","offset":348},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_Tuvalu","surface_form":"Governor-General of Tuvalu","offset":546}]}
