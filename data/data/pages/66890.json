{"id":66890,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_borough","text":"=\"preserve\">A county borough was a type of local government district in England until abolished in 1974.\nLocal government powers were divided between county councils and urban or rural districts.\nFor example: rural districts may not be able to maintain footpaths or street lighting because of their size. Urban districts were based in a town and were able handle these jobs. Schools were the responsibility of county councils because districts were too small to run all types of schools themselves.\nA county borough was a town big enough to run all its own local government, so the local county council had no power inside the county borough.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County_council","surface_form":"county council","offset":150},{"uri":"Urban_district","surface_form":"urban","offset":170},{"uri":"Rural_district","surface_form":"rural district","offset":179}]}
