The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun and Chaeyoung as the seven Twice members. Later, Park decided to add two more girls into the group, making Twice a nine member group by adding Tzuyu, who was added as the audience favorite due to bring the most popular contestant by the end of the show and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. Momo had already been eliminated a few episodes before the finale, so the decision was disliked by some fans.\nOn October 7, 2015 the group's official website was created and their first extended play (EP), 'The Story Begins', would be released with the single \"'Like Ooh-Ahh'\" which was released on October 20.
