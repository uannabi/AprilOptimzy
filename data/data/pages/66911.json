{"id":66911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism","text":"Arianism is a doctrine that came from Arius, a priest who taught in Alexandria. To many Christians, the teachings of Arianism are heretical and are not the correct Christian teachings. For this reason, Arianism has stopped being practiced today, but Arians were a powerful part of Christianity from the 4th to the 7th centuries AD.\nArianism simply teaches that Jesus was not God. For this reason, Arianism opposes the dogma of the Holy Trinity. In 325 AD, the Nicene Creed was made, which the early Christians used to defeat Arianism, with the statement: \"We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the \"Son of God\"...begotten, not made, \"consubstantial with\" the Father.\"\nBelief.\nBetween the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and the First Council of Constantinople in the year 381 there were no less than 18 different Creeds used by Arianists.\nAntitrinitarianism today.\nIn the 16th century there was again a movement against the belief in Trinity. Fausto Sozzini (1539-1604) was well known for teaching this. Another one was Ferenc D\u00E1vid (1510s - 1579). These movements developed into what is called Unitarianism today. Unitarians believe that there is only one person in god, not the three-in-one dogma of trinity. Some of the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses are close to some of the things Arians believed. It is different only in that Arians believed the holy spirit is a person and Jehovah's Witnesses teach it is not a person, but a force God uses to do His will. It would however be false to call them Arians, as they reject many Arian teachings. Mormons and Oneness Pentecostalism also reject the Trinity but for different reasons other than Arianism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Doctrine","surface_form":"doctrine","offset":14},{"uri":"Arius","surface_form":"Arius","offset":38},{"uri":"Alexandria","surface_form":"Alexandria","offset":68},{"uri":"Heresy","surface_form":"heretical","offset":130},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":361},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":375},{"uri":"Dogma","surface_form":"dogma","offset":418},{"uri":"Trinity","surface_form":"Holy Trinity","offset":431},{"uri":"Anno_Domini","surface_form":"AD","offset":452},{"uri":"Nicene_Creed","surface_form":"Nicene Creed","offset":460},{"uri":"Son_of_God","surface_form":"Son of God","offset":598},{"uri":"Consubstantial","surface_form":"consubstantial","offset":633},{"uri":"God_the_Father","surface_form":"Father","offset":658},{"uri":"First_Council_of_Nicaea","surface_form":"First Council of Nicaea","offset":687},{"uri":"First_Council_of_Constantinople","surface_form":"First Council of Constantinople","offset":727},{"uri":"Creed","surface_form":"Creed","offset":812},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":871},{"uri":"Fausto_Sozzini","surface_form":"Fausto Sozzini","offset":942},{"uri":"Ferenc_D%C3%A1vid","surface_form":"Ferenc D\u00E1vid","offset":1019},{"uri":"Unitarianism","surface_form":"Unitarianism","offset":1094},{"uri":"Jehovah%27s_Witnesses","surface_form":"Jehovah's Witnesses","offset":1235},{"uri":"Mormons","surface_form":"Mormons","offset":1548},{"uri":"Oneness_Pentecostalism","surface_form":"Oneness Pentecostalism","offset":1560}]}
