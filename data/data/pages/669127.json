{"id":669127,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Neo-Luddism or new Luddism is a movement of people who are against modern technology. The word Luddite can be an offensive term to describe someone who is afraid of technology.\nThe movement is named after the English Luddites, who were active between 1811 and 1816. The Luddites were textile workers. They were against the new textile machinery. They believed that the machines would replace the workers over time. In response, the Luddites destroyed many of the textile machines.\nNeo-Luddites are concerned about the effect technology has on the environment, people, and/or communities.\nThe neo-Luddite movement has connections with the anti-globalisation movement, anarcho-primitivism, and radical environmentalism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":87},{"uri":"Technophobia","surface_form":"afraid of technology","offset":168},{"uri":"Luddite","surface_form":"Luddite","offset":230},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":297},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":340},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":560},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":573},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"communities","offset":588},{"uri":"Antiglobalization","surface_form":"anti-globalisation","offset":651},{"uri":"Anarcho-primitivism","surface_form":"anarcho-primitivism","offset":680},{"uri":"Environmentalism","surface_form":"radical environmentalism","offset":705}]}
