{"id":66973,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_wash","text":"A car wash is a place to clean the outside, and sometimes the inside, of automobiles.\nIn a modern car wash soaps and other chemicals used are based on milder acids and alkalies. Early car washes often used hydrofluoric acid, a hazardous chemical. Many car washes are now required by law to treat and reuse their water.\nThere are two types of foam: polish and wax. Polish is cheaper and may be harder to rinse, sometimes becoming solid in its holding tank. Wax is more expensive, but rinses well and covers the vehicle with a lighter and puffier foam.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automobile","offset":73},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":158},{"uri":"Hydrofluoric_acid","surface_form":"hydrofluoric acid","offset":206},{"uri":"Polishing","surface_form":"polish","offset":348},{"uri":"Wax","surface_form":"wax","offset":359},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":429}]}
