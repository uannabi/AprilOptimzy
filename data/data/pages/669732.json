{"id":669732,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Monday_(Harvard)","text":"\"Bloody Monday\" is about an annual Harvard football tradition.\n\u201CBloody Monday,\u201D as it came to be known, was a tradition at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, dating back to the 1700\u2019s. In an open field known as \u201Cthe Delta,\u201D where currently stands Memorial Hall, sophomores and freshmen would meet annually on the first Monday of the school year and engage in a free-for-all wrestling match. Sometime in the 1800\u2019s, a ball was added and would be placed between the two groups and each would try to move across the opposing side\u2019s goal line. This game was a precursor to the intercollegiate football that would soon after take hold of the Ivy League. In 1925, with the game well established in the college community, the Harvard Crimson paper still referred to this annual tradition as a \u201Cfootball match.\u201D\nMuch like the first football games played at universities such as Rutgers, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, there were not many rules, if any at all. The event always devolved into a massive fight between the competing students, with injuries, torn clothing, and even arrests being the norm. In 1903, a reporter from the the New York Times noted that \u201Cblack eyes and bruises were seen everywhere, and every one received a liberal smudge of mother earth.\u201D In what is considered the first recorded account of a Harvard football game, James C. Richmond, in 1827 wrote a poem entitled \u201CThe Battle of the Delta.\u201D\nThe Freshmen\u2019s wrath, to Sophs the direful spring\nOf shins unnumbered bruised, great goddess sing;\nLet fire and music in my song be mated,\nThrough warlike crowds a devious way it wins,\nAnd advancing shins meet advancing shins;\nAcross the rampart many a hero bounds;\nBut sing Apollo! In can sing no more,\nFor Mars advancing threw the dust before.\nThe game that would eventually evolve from this spectacle would be no less dangerous. The early days of college football saw gruesome injuries and even deaths. However, the difference is the early Harvard tradition was less about the game, and more about the clash between students. A Harvard Police official, General Charles R Apted, described the games as the \u201Cupperclassmen [gathering] all the Freshman in the Yard and administer[ing] justice.\u201D The faculty viewed the tradition as a hazing rather than a game and eventually voted to ban it from campus in 1860. As a show of protest, the students held a mock funeral for an entity they dubbed \u201CFootball Fight, um.\u201D A report in the Harvard Crimson described it: \u201CSophomores appropriately garbed, held imposing funeral procession and services. A coffin was provided\u2026 and a grave was dug.\u201D\n11 years later, in 1871, the game was brought back to Harvard University, although in a more organized form. Interest in football-like games had picked up among other Ivy League schools, including Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton and Yale. The other schools wished to establish an intercollegiate set of rules that would have more closely resembled modern soccer, but Harvard resisted, wishing to preserve the ability to pick the ball up and tackle opposing players. Harvard eventually found a school with a common style with which it could play against in McGill University of Montreal, Quebec. In 1874, the two teams met in what many consider to be one of the first games \u201Crecognized as the legitimate predecessor of modern football.\u201D","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
