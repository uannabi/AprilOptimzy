{"id":669911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldon_George","text":"Eldon Thomas George (May 10, 1931 \u2013 November 29, 2018) was a Canadian fossil collector and amateur geologist. He was born in Parrsboro, Nova Scotia. He made many important discoveries on the shores of the Minas Basin and the Bay of Fundy in the 1940s.\nGeorge found the world's smallest dinosaur tracks in 1984 near Parrsboro, Nova Scotia, Canada. His other finds include many fossilized amphibian and dinosaur prints that were displayed, along with the world's smallest dinosaur tracks, at his Parrsboro Rock and Mineral Shop and Museum.\nOne of them is a 17-inch (45-cm) track that may have been made by a primitive, two-legged, crocodile-like creature that was nearly 20 feet (6 m) long. George's other discoveries include a fossilized insect with three pairs of wings and a tiny horseshoe crab that supplies a missing link in evolutionary history.\nGeorge died on November 29, 2018 in Parrsboro at the age of 87.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amateur_geology","surface_form":"amateur geologist","offset":91},{"uri":"Parrsboro","surface_form":"Parrsboro","offset":125},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":136},{"uri":"Minas_Basin","surface_form":"Minas Basin","offset":205},{"uri":"Bay_of_Fundy","surface_form":"Bay of Fundy","offset":225},{"uri":"Parrsboro","surface_form":"Parrsboro","offset":315},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":326},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":387},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":401}]}
