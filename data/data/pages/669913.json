{"id":669913,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Judd","text":"e=\"preserve\">Donald Judd (June 3, 1928February 12, 1994) was an American artist. He worked with minimalism. In his work, Judd worked with autonomy and space that objects created by it. He was also known for his works alongside sculptor Robert Morris.\nWhen the National Endowment for the Arts supported his work, Northern Kentucky University hired Judd to build his notable aluminium sculpture that was opened in the middle of the school's campus in 1976. Another commission, \"Untitled\" (1984), a three-part sculpture out of concrete with steel reinforcements, was installed at Laumeier Sculpture Park.\nJudd was born in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, but raised in Marfa, Texas. He studied at College of William and Mary, Columbia University School of General Studies and at the Art Students League of New York. Judd died on February 12, 1994 in Manhattan, New York from non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 65.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minimalism","surface_form":"minimalism","offset":96},{"uri":"Autonomy","surface_form":"autonomy","offset":138},{"uri":"Robert_Morris_(artist)","surface_form":"Robert Morris","offset":236},{"uri":"National_Endowment_for_the_Arts","surface_form":"National Endowment for the Arts","offset":260},{"uri":"Northern_Kentucky_University","surface_form":"Northern Kentucky University","offset":312},{"uri":"Laumeier_Sculpture_Park","surface_form":"Laumeier Sculpture Park","offset":577},{"uri":"Excelsior_Springs%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Excelsior Springs, Missouri","offset":619},{"uri":"Marfa%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Marfa, Texas","offset":662},{"uri":"College_of_William_and_Mary","surface_form":"College of William and Mary","offset":690},{"uri":"Columbia_University_School_of_General_Studies","surface_form":"Columbia University School of General Studies","offset":719},{"uri":"Art_Students_League_of_New_York","surface_form":"Art Students League of New York","offset":776},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":843},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":854},{"uri":"Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","surface_form":"non-Hodgkin lymphoma","offset":868}]}
