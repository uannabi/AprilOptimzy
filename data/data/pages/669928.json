This is after Angela Merkel's decision in October 2018 not to stand for party leader at the 2018 party conference following the party's bad performance in the 2018 Hessian state election and low numbers in national polls.\nOn 29 October 2018, both the CDU's General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and the Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn announced their candidacy in the election. This was followed by Merkel's arch-rival Friedrich Merz announced his bid on 30 October 2018.\nKramp-Karrenbauer was elected leader by winning 45.05% of the vote. Merz won 39.24% of the vote and Spahn won 15.72% of the vote.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":81},{"uri":"Angela_Merkel","surface_form":"Angela Merkel","offset":123},{"uri":"Hessian_state_election%2C_2018","surface_form":"2018 Hessian state election","offset":268},{"uri":"Annegret_Kramp-Karrenbauer","surface_form":"Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer","offset":384},{"uri":"Jens_Spahn","surface_form":"Jens Spahn","offset":446},{"uri":"Friedrich_Merz","surface_form":"Friedrich Merz","offset":541}]}
