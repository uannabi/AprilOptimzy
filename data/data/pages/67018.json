{"id":67018,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-vascular_plant","text":"Non-vascular plants is a general term for those plants without a vascular system (xylem and phloem). Although non-vascular plants do not have these tissues, some of them have other tissues for internal transport of water.\nNonvascular plants have no roots, stems, or leaves. These structures always have some vascular tissue.\nNon-vascular groups.\nIn the past, the term \"non-vascular plant\" included all the algae, but also the fungi as well. Today, it is recognized that these groups are not closely related to plants, and have a very different biology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":48},{"uri":"Vascular_tissue","surface_form":"vascular system","offset":65},{"uri":"Xylem","surface_form":"xylem","offset":82},{"uri":"Phloem","surface_form":"phloem","offset":92},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":215},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":249},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":256},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":266},{"uri":"Vascular_tissue","surface_form":"vascular tissue","offset":308},{"uri":"Alga","surface_form":"alga","offset":406},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungi","offset":426},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":544}]}
