Although at the beginning of her career she was known as \u201CThe one girl\u201D because of her roles in many horror movies beginning in her first ever movie \"Halloween\" (1978) as Laurie Strode, Curtis has since worked in a lot of different movie genres. She has received an Grammy Award nomination and two Golden Globe Awards. Her 1998 book, \"Today I Feel Gross, and Other Grammy That Make My Day\", made the best-seller list in \"The New York Times\".\nIn late the 2010s, Curtis returned as Strode in the horror movie \"Halloween\" (2018) and in the upcoming sequels \"Halloween Kills\" (2020) and \"Halloween Ends\" (2021). She also played Linda Drysdale in the mystery comedy movie \"Knives Out\" (2019).\nEarly life.\nCurtis was born in Santa Monica, California. She is the daughter of actor Tony Curtis and actress Janet Leigh. Her paternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants and two of her maternal great-grandparents were Danish. Curtis's parents divorced in 1962, after which her mother married Robert Brandt. Curtis has an older sister, Kelly Curtis, who is also an actress, and several half-siblings (all from her father's remarriages), Alexandra, Allegra, Ben, and Nicholas Curtis (who died in 1994 of a drug overdose). Curtis attended Westlake School (now Harvard-Westlake School) in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills High School, and graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall. Returning to California in 1976, she attended the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. She considered majoring in social work, but quit after one semester to pursue an acting career.\nPersonal life.\nShe is married to actor Christopher Guest (Baron Haden-Guest) and, as the wife of a Baron, she has the title Baroness Haden-Guest and she could be called The Lady Haden-Guest, but she chooses not to use the title nor the style when in the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":66},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":128},{"uri":"Horror_movie","surface_form":"horror movie","offset":196},{"uri":"Halloween_(1978_movie)","surface_form":"Halloween","offset":245},{"uri":"Laurie_Strode","surface_form":"Laurie Strode","offset":266},{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":333},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":361},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award","surface_form":"Golden Globe Award","offset":393},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":516},{"uri":"Halloween_(2018_movie)","surface_form":"Halloween","offset":603},{"uri":"Sequels","surface_form":"sequels","offset":641},{"uri":"Halloween_Kills","surface_form":"Halloween Kills","offset":650},{"uri":"Halloween_Ends","surface_form":"Halloween Ends","offset":679},{"uri":"Knives_Out","surface_form":"Knives Out","offset":763},{"uri":"Santa_Monica%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Monica, California","offset":814},{"uri":"Tony_Curtis","surface_form":"Tony Curtis","offset":869},{"uri":"Janet_Leigh","surface_form":"Janet Leigh","offset":893},{"uri":"Kelly_Curtis","surface_form":"Kelly Curtis","offset":1130},{"uri":"Drug_overdose","surface_form":"drug overdose","offset":1299},{"uri":"Harvard-Westlake_School","surface_form":"Harvard-Westlake School","offset":1352},{"uri":"Beverly_Hills_High_School","surface_form":"Beverly Hills High School","offset":1396},{"uri":"Choate_Rosemary_Hall","surface_form":"Choate Rosemary Hall","offset":1442},{"uri":"University_of_the_Pacific_(United_States)","surface_form":"University of the Pacific","offset":1514},{"uri":"Stockton%2C_California","surface_form":"Stockton, California","offset":1543},{"uri":"Social_work","surface_form":"social work","offset":1592},{"uri":"Christopher_Guest","surface_form":"Christopher Guest","offset":1700},{"uri":"Baron","surface_form":"Baron","offset":1760}]}
