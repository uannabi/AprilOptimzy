{"id":670269,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_weasel","text":"The Japanese weasel (\"Mustela Itatsi\") is a carnivorous mammal belonging to the family Mustelidae. It lives in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu of Japan. Major habitats are plains, but in western Japan it mainly lives in mountainous areas.\nAppearance.\nAdult males of the Japanese weasel can reach in body length with a tail length of up to. Females are smaller. The fur is orange-brown with darker markings.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nThe Japanese weasel was na\u00ADtive to three of Japan\u2019s four larger is\u00ADlands: Hon\u00ADshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. Over the past cen\u00ADtury, they have been intro\u00ADduced to most other Japan\u00ADese is\u00ADlands to control the population of rodents. Their range now in\u00ADcludes Hokkaido and the many of the Ryukyu Islands.\nJapan\u00ADese weasels are found in a lot of ecosys\u00ADtems in Japan. It mainly lives in moun\u00ADtain\u00ADous and forested places near mov\u00ADing water. Most hunt\u00ADing is done along rivers, but these weasels sometimes go into grasslands or sub\u00ADur\u00ADban areas.\nIn win\u00ADter, these slim weasels spend most of their time under the snow chas\u00ADing small ro\u00ADdents through a maze of tun\u00ADnels. After catch\u00ADing and eat\u00ADing the prey, Japan\u00ADese weasels usually enjoy the warmth of the prey's nest after eat\u00ADing.\nFeeding.\nThey eat mice, frogs, reptiles, insects and crayfish. They sometimes eat berries, seeds and fruits but only when hungry. Males like to eat more mammals and crustacean. Females like to eat insects, fruits and earthworms.\nTheir diet changes depending on the season, the number of some foods. Fish and insects are a part of their diet throughout all seasons. They mostly eat coleoptera insects in spring, fruits in summer, orthoptera insects and crustaceans in autumn and fish and fruit in winter. Japanese weasels help in controlling rodent and other small animal populations.\nBehavior.\nJapanese weasels live by themselves, with the except when mating, and raising the young ones. They do not like other Japanese weasels entering their home range and will defend their home range. When scared, weasels release musk to discourage predators.\nJapanese weasels are also great hunters. They chase down prey by any means, including running down tunnels, climbing trees, or swimming. Anywhere prey can go, the weasel can follow. They are both diurnal and nocturnal.\nReproduction.\nThe mating season is from early May to late June. After mating, gestation takes about 30 days. The number of kits varies from 2 to 12, but is usually 5 or 6. It takes 8 weeks to fully be weaned and live by themselves. Japanese weasels are sexually mature at one year old.\nBreeding season is twice a year in Kyushu, once a year in Hokkaido.\nEconomic importance.\nIn the past century Japanese weasels have been introduced to many small Japanese islands to kill rats that were damaging crops. Together with the use of some rodenticide, the weasels helped reduce rat populations. Japanese weasels are also trapped and used in the fur trade. Japanese weasels also sometimes hunt domestic birds, such as chickens and ducks.\nConservation status.\nAlthough their populations are in slight decline, Japanese weasels are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of their widespread population across Japan. The main threat to Japanese weasels is habitat loss because of residential and commercial development.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivorous","offset":44},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":56},{"uri":"Mustelidae","surface_form":"Mustelidae","offset":87},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":111},{"uri":"Shikoku","surface_form":"Shikoku","offset":119},{"uri":"Kyushu","surface_form":"Kyushu","offset":131},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":141},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":154},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":167},{"uri":"Honsh%C5%AB","surface_form":"Hon\u00ADshu","offset":502},{"uri":"Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB","surface_form":"Kyushu","offset":511},{"uri":"Shikoku","surface_form":"Shikoku","offset":523},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodents","offset":645},{"uri":"Hokkaid%C5%8D","surface_form":"Hokkaido","offset":680},{"uri":"Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB_Islands","surface_form":"Ryukyu Islands","offset":709},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosys\u00ADtems","offset":765},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":780},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"rivers","offset":888},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grasslands","offset":932},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"sub\u00ADur\u00ADban","offset":946},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":1030},{"uri":"Maze","surface_form":"maze","offset":1069},{"uri":"Tunnel","surface_form":"tun\u00ADnels","offset":1077},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mice","offset":1220},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frogs","offset":1226},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptiles","offset":1233},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insects","offset":1243},{"uri":"Crayfish","surface_form":"crayfish","offset":1255},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":1284},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seeds","offset":1293},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruits","offset":1303},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammals","offset":1355},{"uri":"Crustacean","surface_form":"crustacean","offset":1367},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insects","offset":1399},{"uri":"Earthworm","surface_form":"earthworms","offset":1419},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"Fish","offset":1501},{"uri":"Diet_(nutrition)","surface_form":"diet","offset":1538},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"seasons","offset":1558},{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"coleoptera insects","offset":1583},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":1605},{"uri":"Orthoptera","surface_form":"orthoptera insects","offset":1631},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":1698},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodent","offset":1743},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"home","offset":1945},{"uri":"Range_(biology)","surface_form":"range","offset":1950},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":2245},{"uri":"Nocturnal_animals","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":2257},{"uri":"Gestation","surface_form":"gestation","offset":2346},{"uri":"Weaning","surface_form":"weaned","offset":2469},{"uri":"Breeding","surface_form":"Breeding","offset":2554},{"uri":"Hokkaido","surface_form":"Hokkaido","offset":2612},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rats","offset":2740},{"uri":"Rodenticide","surface_form":"rodenticide","offset":2801},{"uri":"Fur_trade","surface_form":"fur trade","offset":2907},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chickens","offset":2979},{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"ducks","offset":2992}]}
