{"id":670417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop","text":"In computer science, a while loop is a statement which is used to execute code repeatedly based on a condition. Simply, it can be thought of as a repeating if statement.\nOverview.\nThe while loop consists of two parts: the condition and a block of code. The condition is evaluated and if it is true, the block of code is executed. This repeats until the condition evaluates to false. As a pre-test loop, the while loop checks the condition before the block is executed. In contrast, the do-while loop checks the condition \"after\" the loop has executed. A while loop would typically be used when you don't know the number of times you would like to loop over the block of code. Instead, code would continue looping until a particular condition is met. When the number of times a loop is to be executed is already known before the execution of the loop, a for loop would be a better choice.\nA template of a while loop is shown below:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nExample.\nExample code in the C programming language is shown below.\n</syntaxhighlight>In this example, the loop first checks to see if the variable x is less than 5. Because it is, it will enter the loop, printing the value of x and then increment x by 1. After completing the code block, it will continue to repeat the code block until x is equal to 5. When x is equal to five, the condition evaluates to false and the code exits the while loop.\nA loop that continues repeating forever is possible if the condition is always true. When this happens, it is up to the developer to create a statement to exit the loop. An example of this is shown below: \u00A0<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n</syntaxhighlight>In the above example, the condition while always be true. To exit the loop, a break statement is used when a specific condition inside the loop evaluates to true.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":3}]}
