{"id":67064,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens","text":"\"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" was a spacecraft, sent to study the planet Saturn, its rings, and its moons.\nThe mission was made by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and Italian Space Agency (ASI). The spacecraft had two main parts: the Cassini orbiter and the Huygens probe. It was launched on October 15, 1997 and entered into orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004. It was the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn and the fourth one to visit Saturn (the others were \"fly-by's\" and did not enter orbit). The mission ended September 2017.\nCassini orbiter.\nThe orbiter was named after the Italian-French astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who discovered some moons of Saturn. Most of the orbiter was designed and built by NASA, although ASI built and programmed some parts that talked to the Huygens probe. The spacecraft spent 13 years in orbit, sending back data. It visited many parts of the Saturn system until it was short of fuel. The Cassini\u2013Huygens ended with a controlled crash into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017.\nHuygens probe.\nESA (European Space Agency) made the Huygens probe, named after the Dutch astronomer, mathematician, and physicist Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan. On December 25 2004, the Huygens probe left the orbiter. A couple weeks later, the probe parachuted onto Saturn's largest moon Titan. Astronomers have wondered what the surface of Titan was like, since it was hidden under thick clouds. It is the only moon in our solar system with a thick atmosphere. The probe descended and sent pictures and other data back for scientists to study. After 90 minutes on the moon, the spacecraft stopped working, as expected. It is the farthest place we have ever landed a spacecraft. The pictures sent while parachuting showed rivers, probably of liquid methane. The surface is much too cold for water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight |auto=all","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":24},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":61},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moons","offset":88},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":119},{"uri":"European_Space_Agency","surface_form":"European Space Agency","offset":129},{"uri":"Italian_Space_Agency","surface_form":"Italian Space Agency","offset":162},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":321},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":589},{"uri":"Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini","surface_form":"Giovanni Domenico Cassini","offset":600},{"uri":"Saturn","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":980},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":1106},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":1124},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physicist","offset":1143},{"uri":"Christiaan_Huygens","surface_form":"Christiaan Huygens","offset":1153},{"uri":"Titan_(moon)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":1321},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":1782}]}
