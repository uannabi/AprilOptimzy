{"id":670762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Bogosort is considered one of the least effective sorting algorithms. It functions by creating random arrangements of given values and randomly moving them until they are sorted. It is not effective for any form of sorting.\nAlgorithm.\nThe Bogosort first takes in a set of values from a user. Next it randomly arranges these values.\nIf the values are now in a sorted order, then the function is finished, else the function repeats itself.\nA working analogy for the Bogosort is to sort a deck of cards by throwing them into the air, picking them up at random, and repeating the process until they are sorted.\nCoding Example.\nThe following code is done in Python 3:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python3\">","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithms","offset":75}]}
