{"id":670789,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_light_processing","text":"e=\"preserve\">Digital light processing (DLP) projector is a kind of video projector. It uses small mirrors that reflect light. The mirrors can be moved to either reflect light or not reflect light. The mirrors move very fast. When the mirror reflects light more often, it makes a lighter color. When the mirror reflects light less often, it makes a darker color. DLP projectors can be bright and have a high resolution. This can make the picture look better. DLP projectors can be small so they can be moved more easily. Some DLP projectors are small enough to fit in a smartphone. Big DLP projectors are often used in movie theaters.\nDigital Micromirror Devices.\nDLP projectors use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to make the picture. A DMD is made of many very small mirrors. The mirrors are in a grid on a semiconductor. Each mirror makes a small part of the picture, called a pixel. The resolution increases when the DMD has more mirrors.\nThe mirrors can be moved so they reflect light through the lens or reflect light somewhere else. When mirror reflects light through the lens, the pixel is light. When the mirror reflects light somewhere else, the pixel is dark. The mirrors move much faster than a person can see. When the mirror spends more time reflecting light through the lens, the pixel is lighter. When the mirror spends more time reflecting light somewhere else, the pixel is darker.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_projector","surface_form":"video projector","offset":67},{"uri":"Display_resolution","surface_form":"resolution","offset":407},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"smartphone","offset":569},{"uri":"Grid","surface_form":"grid","offset":801},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":811},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pixel","offset":882},{"uri":"Lens_(optics)","surface_form":"lens","offset":1004}]}
