{"id":670790,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design","text":"e=\"preserve\">User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of our machines and software interface such as the interface of your computer, printer, phones, etc. It helps the user interact with the system in order to increase the user experience and enhance efficiency.\nGood user interface never draws useless attention and always finish the tasks first. A good format can help the user perform right interactions and a good graphic design can help the user focus on the function in the system. During the design process, we must balance the functions and visual effects to create a stable, adaptable, and functional system for users.\nInterface design is applied in many different areas such as computers, to cars, to planes. Even though most of these areas have similar human interactions, we still need special skills to accomplish the design goals. That is why designers are usually specialized in some areas than others in order to make the best efforts out of themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":77},{"uri":"Machine","surface_form":"machine","offset":91},{"uri":"User_interface","surface_form":"software interface","offset":104},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":153},{"uri":"Computer_printer","surface_form":"printer","offset":163},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"phone","offset":172}]}
