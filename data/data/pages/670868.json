{"id":670868,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G","text":"5G is the fifth generation network of cellular mobile communications, first launched in March of 2019. 5G uses many new technologies that make it faster than 4G. 5G currently can get between 100 Mbit/s and 2 Gbit/s depending on the frequency that is used. It is eventually to replace 4G,\nLowband 5G is a type of 5G that uses low frequencies, just as 4G does. Lowband 5G has long range (meaning you can be far away from a tower or inside a building and still get signal) but slower speeds than other types of 5G. Lowband 5G is only a little bit faster than LTE. Lowband 5G usually has speeds of around 100 Mbit/s.\nMidband 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies slightly higher than lowband 5G. It has shorter range than lowband 5G, but you can usually still get service indoors using midband 5G. Midband 5G is much faster than LTE. Midband 5G usually has speeds of 600 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.\nmmWave 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies much higher than lowband and midband. It has very short range. With mmWave, you can't get service inside buildings. Most solid objects can block mmWave. mmWave is much faster than any other type of 5G and can reach speeds of up to 2 Gbit/s currently. mmWave is considered the least practical version of 5G since the range is so short and basically anything can block it.\n4G phones do not work on 5G. To use 5G, you need a phone that supports it. Most 5G phones have \"5G\" at the end of the phone's name.\nThere are concerns from conspiracy theorists that 5G might cause cancer or COVID-19. Scientists have found these theories to not be true.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mobile_communication","surface_form":"mobile communication","offset":47},{"uri":"2019","surface_form":"2019","offset":97},{"uri":"4G","surface_form":"4G","offset":284},{"uri":"COVID-19","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":1516}]}
