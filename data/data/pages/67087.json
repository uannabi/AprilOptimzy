It came into force on 1 July 1997.\nThese areas are usually called \"ceremonial counties\" or \"preserved counties\" in Wales. In Scotland a Statutory Instrument (rule written by a minister) defines the size of the lieutenancy. They are usually one local council area, but some council areas are too small or to large for one Lord Lieutenant.\nFor a list of the areas in England see Ceremonial counties of England","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Act_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Act of Parliament","offset":58},{"uri":"Lord_Lieutenant","surface_form":"Lord Lieutenant","offset":101},{"uri":"Statutory_Instrument","surface_form":"Statutory Instrument","offset":400}]}
