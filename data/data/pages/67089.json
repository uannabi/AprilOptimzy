{"id":67089,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meristem","text":"A meristem is a tissue in plants made of dividing cells. They are in parts of the plant where growth can take place.\nPlant cells which are differentiated generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Therefore, cell division in the meristem is necessary to get new cells. This allows for the growth of tissues and new organs needed by the plant.\nMeristematic cells have the same function for plants as stem cells have for animals. They are incompletely or not at all differentiated, and are capable of continued cell division.\nThe cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely. The vacuoles are extremely small. The cytoplasm does not contain plastids (such as chloroplasts, but they are there in rudimentary form ('proplastids'). Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities. The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall.\nApical meristem.\nThe apical meristem, or growing tip, is found in the buds and growing tips of roots in plants.\nIt begins growth of new cells in young seedlings at the tips of roots and shoots (forming buds, among other things). Specifically, an active apical meristem lays down a growing root or shoot behind itself, pushing itself forward. Apical meristems are very small, compared to the cylinder-shaped lateral meristems.\nPrimary meristems.\nThese meristems are responsible for primary growth, or an increase in length or height.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biological_tissue","surface_form":"tissue","offset":16},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":26},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"dividing cells","offset":41},{"uri":"Cell_differentiation","surface_form":"differentiated","offset":139},{"uri":"Mitosis","surface_form":"cell division","offset":227},{"uri":"Stem_cell","surface_form":"stem cell","offset":418},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":438},{"uri":"Protoplasm","surface_form":"protoplasm","offset":567},{"uri":"Vacuole","surface_form":"vacuole","offset":609},{"uri":"Chloroplasts","surface_form":"chloroplasts","offset":688},{"uri":"Cell_wall","surface_form":"cell wall","offset":841}]}
