{"id":67095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_cambium","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cork cambium is a tissue in many vascular plants as part of the bark (periderm).\nThe cork cambium is a lateral meristem and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the epidermis in roots and stems. It is found in woody and many herbaceous dicots, gymnosperms and some monocots, which usually have no secondary growth.\nCork cambium is one of the plant's meristems - the tissues that consist of embryonic (not specialized) cells from which the plant grows. It is one of the many layers of bark, between the cork and primary phloem. The function of cork cambium is to produce the cork, a tough protective material.\nSynonyms for cork cambium are bark cambium, pericambium or phellogen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissue","offset":31},{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"vascular plant","offset":46},{"uri":"Bark","surface_form":"bark","offset":77},{"uri":"Lateral","surface_form":"lateral","offset":116},{"uri":"Meristem","surface_form":"meristem","offset":124},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root","offset":204},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stems","offset":214},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":236},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":251},{"uri":"Dicot","surface_form":"dicot","offset":262},{"uri":"Gymnosperm","surface_form":"gymnosperm","offset":270},{"uri":"Monocot","surface_form":"monocot","offset":291},{"uri":"Meristem","surface_form":"meristem","offset":376},{"uri":"Embryo","surface_form":"embryo","offset":416},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cells","offset":444},{"uri":"Phloem","surface_form":"phloem","offset":545}]}
