{"id":67111,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubmoss","text":"Clubmosses are a group of plants in the Lycopodiophyta, which are the most ancient group of land plants. The clubmosses are an order Lycopodiales, (or a subclass Lycopodiopsida).\nClubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants, with small, scale-like leaves, homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves, branching stems (usually dichotomous), and generally simple form.\nA powder known simply as \"lycopodium\", consisting of dried spores of the common clubmoss, was used in Victorian theater to produce flame-effects. A blown cloud of spores burned rapidly and brightly, but with little heat. It was considered safe by the standards of the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lycopodiophyta","surface_form":"Lycopodiophyta","offset":40},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":127},{"uri":"Subclass_(biology)","surface_form":"subclass","offset":153},{"uri":"Vascular_plant","surface_form":"vascular plant","offset":245},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":305},{"uri":"Sporangium","surface_form":"sporangia","offset":321}]}
