{"id":67115,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackish_water","text":"e=\"preserve\">Brackish water (less commonly brack water) is salt water and fresh water mixed together. It is saltier than fresh water, but not as salty as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers.\nSome human activities can produce brackish water, mostly certain civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish pools for freshwater prawns.\nTechnically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of salt per litre\u2014more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (ppt or \u2030). Thus, \"brackish\" covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space and/or time.\nEtymology.\nThe term brackish water comes from the Low German word \"Brack\", which is a small lake made when a storm tide breaks a dike and floods land behind the dike.\nEstuaries.\nThe most important brackish water habitats are estuaries, where a river meets the sea, mixing salt and fresh water. The River Thames flowing through London is one of the most familiar of river estuaries.\nMangroves.\nAnother important brackish water habitat is the mangrove swamp or mangal.\nBrackish seas and lakes.\nSome seas and lakes are brackish. The Baltic Sea is a brackish sea adjoining the North Sea.\nThe Caspian Sea is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal seawater. The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the Caspian seal) and the great sturgeons, the source of caviar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salt_water","surface_form":"salt water","offset":59},{"uri":"Salinity","surface_form":"saltier","offset":108},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":121},{"uri":"Salt_water","surface_form":"seawater","offset":154},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuaries","offset":226},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":265},{"uri":"Aquifer","surface_form":"aquifer","offset":272},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":287},{"uri":"Civil_engineering","surface_form":"civil engineering","offset":347},{"uri":"Dike_(construction)","surface_form":"dikes","offset":382},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coastal","offset":408},{"uri":"Prawn","surface_form":"prawn","offset":467},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":540},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"litre","offset":549},{"uri":"Salinity","surface_form":"salinity","offset":789},{"uri":"Low_German","surface_form":"Low German","offset":894},{"uri":"Storm_tide","surface_form":"storm tide","offset":953},{"uri":"Dike","surface_form":"dike","offset":973},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuaries","offset":1069},{"uri":"Thames","surface_form":"Thames","offset":1148},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1171},{"uri":"Mangrove","surface_form":"mangrove","offset":1285},{"uri":"Swamp","surface_form":"swamp","offset":1294},{"uri":"Baltic_Sea","surface_form":"Baltic Sea","offset":1374},{"uri":"North_Sea","surface_form":"North Sea","offset":1417},{"uri":"Caspian_Sea","surface_form":"Caspian Sea","offset":1432},{"uri":"Sturgeon","surface_form":"sturgeon","offset":1685},{"uri":"Caviar","surface_form":"caviar","offset":1710}]}
