{"id":67119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy","text":"Sustainable energy is energy that is created in an environmentally friendly way.\nIt involves both energy efficiency and renewable energy. Both resources help to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\nEfficient energy use allows energy demand to slow so that rising clean energy supplies can make big cuts in fossil fuel burning. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.\nAny serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy_efficiency","surface_form":"energy efficiency","offset":98},{"uri":"Renewable_energy","surface_form":"renewable energy","offset":120},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":182},{"uri":"Clean_energy","surface_form":"clean energy","offset":273},{"uri":"Fossil_fuel","surface_form":"fossil fuel","offset":316}]}
