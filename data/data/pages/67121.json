{"id":67121,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoprene","text":"e=\"preserve\">Neoprene is the DuPont Performance Elastomers trade name for a family of synthetic rubbers based on polychloroprene (polymer form of Chloroprene). Neoprene was invented by DuPont scientists after Dr. Elmer K. Bolton of DuPont attended a lecture by Fr Julius Arthur Nieuwland, a professor of chemistry at the University of Notre Dame.\nApplications.\nIt is used in a wide variety of environments, such as in wetsuits, laptop sleeves, cars, bombs, electrical insulation, and car fan belts. Its chemical inertness makes it well suited for industrial applications such as gaskets, hoses, and corrosion-resistant coatings. It can also be used as a base for adhesives.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":96},{"uri":"Chloroprene","surface_form":"Chloroprene","offset":146},{"uri":"Elmer_Keiser_Bolton","surface_form":"Elmer K.
