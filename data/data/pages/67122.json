{"id":67122,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_11","text":"Pioneer 11 (also known as Pioneer G) was the second mission to visit Jupiter and the first mission to visit Saturn. The spacecraft was launched on April 6, 1973 and flew by Jupiter on December 4, 1974 and Saturn on September 1, 1979. The probe was last heard from November 1995 when the last communication between Earth and the probe ended due to power limitation and vast diatance.\nBoth Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 had plaques etched in gold. The plaques were designed by a team lead by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life should the spacecraft come into contact with it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight/IP","spaceflight/IP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":69},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":108},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":120},{"uri":"April_6","surface_form":"April 6","offset":147},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":156},{"uri":"December_4","surface_form":"December 4","offset":184},{"uri":"1974","surface_form":"1974","offset":196},{"uri":"September_1","surface_form":"September 1","offset":215},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":228},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":273},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":314},{"uri":"Pioneer_10","surface_form":"Pioneer 10","offset":388},{"uri":"Carl_Sagan","surface_form":"Carl Sagan","offset":486},{"uri":"Extraterrestrial_life","surface_form":"extraterrestrial life","offset":517}]}
