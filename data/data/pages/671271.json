In total, there are thirteen Catalan solids (as there are thirtin Archimedean solids). They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eug\u00E8ne Charles Catalan of the 19th centurty.\nEach Catalan solid is a convex polyhedron. Like with Archimewdean solids, each surface is made of the same shape.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":46},{"uri":"Archimedean_solid","surface_form":"Archimedean solid","offset":65},{"uri":"Dual","surface_form":"duality (mathematics","offset":120},{"uri":"Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan","surface_form":"Eug\u00E8ne Charles Catalan","offset":276},{"uri":"Convex_polyhedron","surface_form":"convex polyhedron","offset":345}]}
