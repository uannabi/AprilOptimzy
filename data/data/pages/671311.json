The group is made up of four vocalists: Justin Jeffre, Jeff Timmons and brothers Nick and Drew Lachey. It was formed by Timmons in Los Angeles, California.

They joined a record label later.\nThe group has sold over 10 million records across the world. They have had eight top 40 singles in the United States.\nSongs from 98 Degrees include \"This Gift\", \"True to Your Heart\" and \"Invisible Man\". In 1999 the group released the album \"This Christmas\". It sold over one million copies.\nIn 2002, the group took a break from recording and touring. In 2012, they got back together.
