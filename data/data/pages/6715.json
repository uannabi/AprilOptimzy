{"id":6715,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men","text":"The fictional characters, the X-Men, are a team of superheroes who were born with special mutant powers, making them different from regular humans. The X-Men characters are owned by Marvel Comics, which publishes comic books featuring them as well as many other superheroes. The comic book was one of the first to combine social issues and social commentary into a superhero story, set in a world where people with mutant abilities are hated by those born without them. This is similar to acts of ableism seen throughout history. Unlike \"some\" mutants, the X-Men try to be good and show tolerance toward humans and other mutants. The idea behind the superheroes were inspired by the African-American equality supporters like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.\nOriginal X-Men.\nThe original X-Men, as created by writer Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, were\nand all first appeared in \"X-Men #1\" (Sept 1963).\nThe leader and mentor of the X-Men is Professor Charles Xavier, who is more commonly known as \"Professor X\" and has mental powers. He wants to gain civil rights for mutants in the way that Martin Luther King did for African Americans; through peace.\nOther X-Men.\nSome of the X-Men's enemies include Magneto, Mystique, Sabretooth, Toad, Juggernaut, Mister Sinister and Apocalypse. The leader of X-Men's enemies is Magneto. He wants to gain civil rights for mutants in the forceful style of Malcolm X.\nOther media.\nThe X-Men characters have since been featured in various comic book series, motion pictures, toys, animated series, and much more.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":4},{"uri":"Superhero","surface_form":"superhero","offset":51},{"uri":"Mutant_(Marvel)","surface_form":"mutant","offset":90},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"characters","offset":158},{"uri":"Marvel_Comics","surface_form":"Marvel Comics","offset":182},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":213},{"uri":"Social_commentary","surface_form":"social commentary","offset":340},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutant","offset":415},{"uri":"Ableism","surface_form":"ableism","offset":497},{"uri":"Tolerance","surface_form":"tolerance","offset":587},{"uri":"Malcolm_X","surface_form":"Malcolm X","offset":725},{"uri":"Martin_Luther_King","surface_form":"Martin Luther King","offset":739},{"uri":"Stan_Lee","surface_form":"Stan Lee","offset":816},{"uri":"Jack_Kirby","surface_form":"Jack Kirby","offset":829},{"uri":"1963","surface_form":"1963","offset":889},{"uri":"African_Americans","surface_form":"African Americans","offset":1112},{"uri":"Magneto","surface_form":"Magneto","offset":1195},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":1466},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"motion pictures","offset":1485},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy","offset":1502},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated series","offset":1508}]}
