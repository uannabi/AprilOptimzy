{"id":6717,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man","text":"Iron Man is a fictional superhero who wears a suit of armor. His alter ego is Tony Stark. He was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Larry Lieber for Marvel Comics in Tales of Suspense #39 in the year 1963 and appears in their comic books and the tritagonist in the Marvel Universe. He is also one of the main protagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man is played by Robert Downey Jr in the movies Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Captain America: Civil War, and Avengers: Endgame and he will reprise his role in Black Widow and in the Disney+ series Iron Heart.\nPowers.\nIn the movies and the earlier comic books, Tony Stark is a human. Outside the suit, he does not have any superpowers, however he is very intelligent. He made the suit himself. Iron Man can fly and shoot beams from his hands using special technology called \"repulsors\" in his boots and gloves. He is not hurt by most weapons like guns and cannons. There are many versions of the Iron Man suit, because Stark keeps making improvements.\nIn the later comic books, Stark took an experimental virus called \"Extremis\" which allowed him to control his suit with his mind and summon it wherever he was. Stark would eventually develop an armor that he could store in his body. This armor was known as the \"Bleeding Edge Model 37\".\nOrigin story.\nStark inherited a large American company called \"Stark Industries\" when his father died. He was badly injured by a bomb in an attack planned by people who did not like him running his company. Shrapnel from the explosion was moving towards his heart. This would have killed him, but a scientist called Yinsen who was with him made a magnet for his chest which would keep the shrapnel away. In the movies, he makes an \"arc reactor\" which is put into his chest to stop the shrapnel.\nYinsen and Stark secretly build a heavy suit of armor which they plan to use to escape. However, during the escape, Yinsen dies so that the kidnappers will be distracted from Stark escaping. Stark escapes safely and goes back to America. He makes a better suit and uses it to fight evil.\nPersonality.\nTony Stark is charismatic and eccentric, he is also very proud, but also very altruist and heroic. He did not have a good childhood, and this affects how he acts.\nStark is very smart, and a very talented inventor. His technology is always very advanced, and Iron Man is his greatest piece of work. In both the comics and the movies, he uses the arc reactor (or \"repulsor technology\") as a form of sustainable energy to help the world.\nStark has very few close friends. Two of them are Pepper Potts, his personal assistant who becomes his girlfriend, and James Rhodes, an American soldier who operates the War Machine armor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Superhero","surface_form":"superhero","offset":24},{"uri":"Armor","surface_form":"armor","offset":54},{"uri":"Alter_ego","surface_form":"alter ego","offset":65},{"uri":"Stan_Lee","surface_form":"Stan Lee","offset":108},{"uri":"Jack_Kirby","surface_form":"Jack Kirby","offset":118},{"uri":"Larry_Lieber","surface_form":"Larry Lieber","offset":133},{"uri":"Marvel_Comics","surface_form":"Marvel Comics","offset":150},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":227},{"uri":"Marvel_Cinematic_Universe","surface_form":"Marvel Cinematic Universe","offset":330},{"uri":"Robert_Downey_Jr","surface_form":"Robert Downey Jr","offset":379},{"uri":"Iron_Man_(movie)","surface_form":"Iron Man","offset":410},{"uri":"Iron_Man_2","surface_form":"Iron Man 2","offset":420},{"uri":"The_Avengers_(movie)","surface_form":"The Avengers","offset":432},{"uri":"Iron_Man_3","surface_form":"Iron Man 3","offset":446},{"uri":"Black_Widow_(movie)","surface_form":"Black Widow","offset":540},{"uri":"Disney%2B","surface_form":"Disney+","offset":563},{"uri":"Fly","surface_form":"fly","offset":787},{"uri":"Beam","surface_form":"beam","offset":801},{"uri":"Boots","surface_form":"boots","offset":873},{"uri":"Gloves","surface_form":"gloves","offset":883},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"gun","offset":927},{"uri":"Cannon","surface_form":"cannon","offset":936},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1357},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":1366},{"uri":"Shrapnel","surface_form":"Shrapnel","offset":1526},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explosion","offset":1544},{"uri":"Sustainable_energy","surface_form":"sustainable energy","offset":2512},{"uri":"Personal_assistant","surface_form":"personal assistant","offset":2618},{"uri":"War_Machine","surface_form":"War Machine","offset":2720}]}
