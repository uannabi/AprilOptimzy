{"id":671734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_Arms_of_Liechtenstein","text":"The coat of arms of Liechtenstein is used as the great arms of the nation. As the sovereign emblem of the Principality of Liechtenstein, its use is reserved for the members of the Princely House and state authorities. Private individuals may be authorized to use the great arms, if it is in the interest of the State. The arms are a history of the Princely House, and show the many different areas of Europe with which Liechtenstein has been involved, either by conquest or by marriage.\nThe first quarter is Silesia; the second is the arms of the Kuenring family; the third quarter, the Duchy of Troppau; and the fourth quarter, the arms of the East Frisian family Cirksena representing County of Rietberg. The base is occupied by the arms of the Duchy of J\u00E4gerndorf. The small gold and red shield of the Princely House is shown in the middle of the larger shield. The Princely hat crowns a purple cloak with ermine lining behind the large coat of arms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liechtenstein","surface_form":"Liechtenstein","offset":20},{"uri":"Principality","surface_form":"Principality","offset":106},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":401},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":477},{"uri":"Silesia","surface_form":"Silesia","offset":508},{"uri":"Kuenring","surface_form":"Kuenring","offset":547},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Troppau","surface_form":"Duchy of Troppau","offset":587},{"uri":"East_Frisia","surface_form":"East Frisia","offset":645},{"uri":"Cirksena","surface_form":"Cirksena","offset":665},{"uri":"County_of_Rietberg","surface_form":"County of Rietberg","offset":687},{"uri":"Duchy_of_J%C3%A4gerndorf","surface_form":"Duchy of J\u00E4gerndorf","offset":747},{"uri":"Gold_(color)","surface_form":"gold","offset":778},{"uri":"Red","surface_form":"red","offset":787},{"uri":"Hat","surface_form":"hat","offset":878},{"uri":"Purple","surface_form":"purple","offset":891},{"uri":"Cloak","surface_form":"cloak","offset":898},{"uri":"Ermine_(heraldry)","surface_form":"ermine","offset":909}]}
