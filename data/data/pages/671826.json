{"id":671826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaduct","text":"A viaduct is a bridge composed of several small spans. It is built for crossing a valley, dry or wetland, or forming an overpass or flyover.\nThe word \"viaduct\" has two parts from Latin: \"via\" for road and \"ducere\", to lead. The ancient Romans did not use this word; it was invented in the nineteenth-century by analogy with aqueduct.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":15},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":82},{"uri":"Wetland","surface_form":"wetland","offset":97},{"uri":"Overpass","surface_form":"overpass","offset":120},{"uri":"Flyover","surface_form":"flyover","offset":132},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":179},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Romans","offset":228},{"uri":"Analogy","surface_form":"analogy","offset":311},{"uri":"Aqueduct","surface_form":"aqueduct","offset":324}]}
