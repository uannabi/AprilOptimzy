He started training as an artistic gymnast at six years old when he met his coach, Lin Yu-Shin. Lee joined the gymnastic team when he studied in Gong Jheng Elementary School located in Luo-Dong Township. Lee was nicknamed \u201CMarket boy Kai\u201D because he liked to perform his gymnastic skills in the traditional market where his parents worked.1 At the beginning of his career, Lee started practicing a difficult element named \u201CThomas Flairs\u201D, which was commonly performed on the floor in gymnastics. Because of his coach\u2019s suggestion, Lee moved the Thomas Flairs into his pommel horse routine when he studied in the middle school.2\nWhen Lee Chih-Kai was 15, he left his hometown Yilan county and moved to Taoyuan city, where Lin Yu-Shin coached a university gymnastic team. Lee practiced with the team in the early morning before going to school and returned to the gym after school. During high school, he practiced at least 8 hours per day. His coach said that Lee was not the most talented gymnast, but was the most hard-working one.3\nIn 2013, Lee Chih-Kai joined the adult national team training program, which pursued to attend the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, and trained at the National Sports Training Center.4 Before Lee went to National Taiwan Sport University (NTSU), he had several competition experiences and was regarded as an upcoming star of Taiwanese gymnastics.\nYoung Adulthood.\nLee Chih-Kai made his debut as a member of the national team participating in the 2014 Incheon Asian Game, where he was eventually ranked as 6th in the individual all-round event, 8th in the floor exercise event, and 5th in the vault event.5 In 2015, Lee represented National Taiwan Sport University (NTSU), where he studied, at the National Intercollegiate Athletic Games.

He was the first gymnast to qualify the Olympics since the 2000 Sydney Olympic games. Lee was diagnosed with a broken right shinbone and a sprained right ankle one month before the Olympic game. Lee lost the chance to move to the finals because these injuries affected his performance. After the failure in the Olympic game, Lee started training overseas. In addition, his coach helped him adapt to stressful environments by imitating the crowds and noisy environment when he was practicing.\nIn August 2017, Lee Chih-Kai won the gold medal in the pommel horse event in the Taipei Universiade by performing his signature \u201CThomas Flairs\u201D movement in the routine.
