{"id":67198,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton","text":"An endoskeleton is a structure that holds an animal from inside.\nOne can find endoskeletons in three phyla and one subclass of animals: in Chordata, Echinodermata, Porifera and Coleoidea. An endoskeleton allows the body to move and gives the body structure and shape.\nA true endoskeleton develops from mesodermal tissue. Such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; here, a mollusc exoskeleton developed into several sorts of internal structure, the \"cuttlebone\" of cuttlefish being the best-known version. An important advantage of an endoskeleton over an exoskeleton is that the endoskeleton provides more structural support.\nEndoskeletons hold inner organs, tissues, and systems together easily.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":45},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phyla","offset":101},{"uri":"Subclass_(biology)","surface_form":"subclass","offset":115},{"uri":"Chordata","surface_form":"Chordata","offset":139},{"uri":"Echinoderm","surface_form":"Echinoderm","offset":149},{"uri":"Porifera","surface_form":"Porifera","offset":164},{"uri":"Coleoidea","surface_form":"Coleoidea","offset":177},{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissue","offset":313},{"uri":"Skeleton","surface_form":"skeleton","offset":328},{"uri":"Mollusc","surface_form":"mollusc","offset":459},{"uri":"Exoskeleton","surface_form":"exoskeleton","offset":467},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"developed","offset":479},{"uri":"Cuttlefish","surface_form":"cuttlefish","offset":551}]}
