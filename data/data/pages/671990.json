{"id":671990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong","text":"A gong is an East and Southeast Asian musical percussion instrument. It is a bowl-shaped, circular metal disc which a person hits with a mallet or thick padded stick.\nGongs produce two distinct types of sound. A gong with a flat surface gives a \"crash\" rather than a tuned note. In Indonesian gamelan ensembles, some gongs are made to give a beat note in the range from about 1 to 5 Hz. The use of the term \"gong\" for both these types of instrument is common.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asian","surface_form":"Asian","offset":32},{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion instrument","offset":46},{"uri":"Bowl","surface_form":"bowl","offset":77},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":99},{"uri":"Mallet","surface_form":"mallet","offset":137},{"uri":"Indonesian","surface_form":"Indonesian","offset":282},{"uri":"Gamelan","surface_form":"gamelan","offset":293},{"uri":"Hz","surface_form":"Hz","offset":383}]}
