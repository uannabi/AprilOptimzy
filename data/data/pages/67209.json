{"id":67209,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoospore","text":"e=\"preserve\">A \"zoospore\" is an asexual spore that uses a flagellum for moving around. It is also called a \"swarm spore\". These spores are created by some algae and fungi to multiply themselves.\nFlagella.\nThere are two types of flagellated zoospores, \"whiplash\" and \"tinsel\" or \"decorated\".\nBoth \"tinsel\" and \"whiplash\" flagella beat in a sinusoidal wave pattern, but when both are present, the tinsel will beat in the opposite direction of the whiplash, to give 2 axes of control of motility.\nZoosporangium.\nA \"zoosporangium\" is the sexual structure in which the zoospores develop in a plant, fungi, or protists.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asexuality","surface_form":"asexual","offset":32},{"uri":"Spore","surface_form":"spore","offset":40},{"uri":"Flagellum","surface_form":"flagellum","offset":58},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"moving","offset":72},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":155},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":165},{"uri":"Multiply","surface_form":"multiply","offset":174},{"uri":"Sinusoidal","surface_form":"sinusoidal","offset":339},{"uri":"Motility","surface_form":"motility","offset":484},{"uri":"Protist","surface_form":"protist","offset":604}]}
