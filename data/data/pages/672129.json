These two hills are West Sheshan, which is 97 meters high, and East Sheshan, which is 100.8 meters high.\nThe Chinese name is \"Sh\u00E9sh\u0101n\" (\u4F58\u5C71). \"Sh\u00E9\" (\u4F58) is the name of a Chinese family, and \"sh\u0101n\" (\u5C71) is a word that can mean \"mountain\", \"mountains\", \"hill\", or \"hills\". Some people say that the hills' name used to be \"Sh\u00E9sh\u0101n\" (\u86C7\u5C71), meaning \"Snake Hill\", but that the Chinese character was changed because people don't like snakes.\nThe hills are part of a forest park that is 64.08 square kilometers big. The park is open from 8 to 4:30.\nThe top of the West Hill has Our Lady of Sheshan Catholic Church and the Sheshan Observatory.
