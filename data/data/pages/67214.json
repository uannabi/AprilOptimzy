His three-domain system is based upon genetic relationships. It divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes. Looked at another way, they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":3},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":14},{"uri":"Taxon","surface_form":"taxon","offset":82},{"uri":"Rank","surface_form":"rank","offset":103},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":111},{"uri":"Kingdom_(biology)","surface_form":"kingdom","offset":136},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomic","offset":202},{"uri":"Genetic","surface_form":"genetic","offset":256},{"uri":"Prokaryote","surface_form":"prokaryote","offset":445}]}
