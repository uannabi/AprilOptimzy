{"id":67216,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin","text":"Keratin is one of a family of fibrous proteins. Keratin is what makes up hair in animals, as well as horns, nails, hooves, shells, beaks, and feathers. The name comes from Greek word \"keras\" meaning \"horn\".\nKeratins are tough and insoluble. They form the hard but non-mineral structures in reptiles, birds, amphibians and mammals. A similar biological toughness is found in chitin.\nVariety of animal uses.\nArthropods such as crustaceans often have parts of their exoskeleton made of keratin, sometimes in combination with chitin.\nKeratins are also found in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals, including roundworms (who also have an outer layer made of keratin).\nAlthough it is now difficult to be certain, the scales, claws, some protective armour and the beaks of dinosaurs would, almost certainly, have been composed of a type of keratin.\nSilk.\nThe silk fibroins produced by insects and spiders are often classified as keratins, though it is unclear whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins.\nSilk found in insect pupae, and in spider webs and egg casings, also has twisted \u03B2-pleated sheets incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fibrous_protein","surface_form":"fibrous proteins.","offset":30},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":73},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":81},{"uri":"Horn_(anatomy)","surface_form":"horns","offset":101},{"uri":"Nail_(anatomy)","surface_form":"nails","offset":108},{"uri":"Hoof","surface_form":"hooves","offset":115},{"uri":"Animal_shell","surface_form":"shells","offset":123},{"uri":"Beak","surface_form":"beak","offset":131},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":142},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":172},{"uri":"Solubility","surface_form":"insoluble","offset":230},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"non-mineral","offset":264},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":290},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":300},{"uri":"Amphibian","surface_form":"amphibian","offset":307},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":322},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biological","offset":341},{"uri":"Chitin","surface_form":"chitin","offset":374},{"uri":"Arthropods","surface_form":"Arthropods","offset":406},{"uri":"Crustacea","surface_form":"crustacea","offset":425},{"uri":"Exoskeleton","surface_form":"exoskeleton","offset":463},{"uri":"Chitin","surface_form":"chitin","offset":522},{"uri":"Gastrointestinal_tract","surface_form":"gastrointestinal tract","offset":561},{"uri":"Roundworm","surface_form":"roundworm","offset":612},{"uri":"Thyreophora","surface_form":"protective armour","offset":739},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":774},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":860},{"uri":"Fibroin","surface_form":"fibroin","offset":865},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":886},{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spider","offset":898},{"uri":"Pupa","surface_form":"pupa","offset":1048},{"uri":"Spider_web","surface_form":"spider web","offset":1062}]}
