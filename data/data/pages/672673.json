It also starred Cheryl Hines as Larry's wife, Jeff Garlin as his manager and best friend, Jeff, and Susie Essman as Jeff's wife, Susie.\nIt was filmed in Cin\u00E9ma v\u00E9rit\u00E9 style, meaning the characters knew the camera was there, and added it into the acting style.\nAfter the eighth season ended in September 2011, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" went on a hiatus. The series finally returned for a ninth season in October 2017, while a tenth season is in production since October 2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"HBO","surface_form":"HBO","offset":81},{"uri":"Larry_David","surface_form":"Larry David","offset":155},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":244},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":276},{"uri":"Cheryl_Hines","surface_form":"Cheryl Hines","offset":307},{"uri":"Jeff_Garlin","surface_form":"Jeff Garlin","offset":337},{"uri":"Susie_Essman","surface_form":"Susie Essman","offset":391},{"uri":"Cin%C3%A9ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9","surface_form":"Cin\u00E9ma v\u00E9rit\u00E9","offset":444},{"uri":"Hiatus","surface_form":"hiatus","offset":633}]}
