{"id":672808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner","text":"e=\"preserve\">Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner are fictional characters from the \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoon series. In the cartoons, the Coyote repeatedly tries to catch the Road Runner. However, the Road Runner runs very fast. That means the Coyote never gets the Road Runner.\nInstead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses complex traps to get his prey. They don't work, and often hurt the Coyote instead. Many of these traps are mail-ordered from companies named Acme.\nThe characters were made by writer Michael Maltese and animation director Chuck Jones in 1948. They were made for the Warner Bros. network.\nIt was originally meant to parody chase cartoons, like \"Tom and Jerry\". It became popular in its own right.\nThe Coyote and the Road Runner were in a number of video games on Atari, the Nintendo Entertainment System and the PlayStation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":52},{"uri":"Looney_Tunes","surface_form":"Looney Tunes","offset":83},{"uri":"Merrie_Melodies","surface_form":"Merrie Melodies","offset":102},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":312},{"uri":"Michael_Maltese","surface_form":"Michael Maltese","offset":528},{"uri":"Animation_director","surface_form":"animation director","offset":548},{"uri":"Chuck_Jones","surface_form":"Chuck Jones","offset":567},{"uri":"Warner_Bros.","surface_form":"Warner Bros.","offset":611},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parody","offset":660},{"uri":"Tom_and_Jerry","surface_form":"Tom and Jerry","offset":689},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":792},{"uri":"Atari","surface_form":"Atari","offset":807},{"uri":"Nintendo_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"Nintendo Entertainment System","offset":818},{"uri":"PlayStation","surface_form":"PlayStation","offset":856}]}
