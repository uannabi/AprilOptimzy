The population was 8,357 as of 2018, making it the municipality with the most people in the county The name of the town comes from the phrase \"bend in the corner where the children are\" in the language of the original Dutch settlers, by the Dutch word \"Kinderhoek.\" The eighth president of the United States, Martin Van Buren was born in Kinderhook.\nThe city of Kinderhook has two villages and one hamlet.\nEtymology.\nKinderhook was originally spelled 'Kinderhoek' by famous explorer Henry Hudson in 1609, when spotting some American Indian children looking at his ship, the Half Moon sailing upstream.\nHistory.\nHudson had many other encounters with the Indians, who were from the Mohican tribe, such as trading and skirmishing. When the Dutch settled Kinderhook, they had further warfare. However, the Dutch prevailed and established it as a district in 1772 and a town in 1788. Since then, the town lost a lot of land to other towns. In 1775, Chatham took a significant portion of the town, followed by Ghent in 1818 and Stuyvesant in 1823. Kinderhook is one of the original towns of Columbia County and as a result is the most populous.\nGeography.\nThe town has a total area of 32.4 square miles (83.9 km2), of which 31.8 square miles (82.4 km2) is land and 0.62 square miles (1.6 km2), or 1.87%, is water, including Kinderhook Lake, Kinderhook Creek, and the waterfalls of Valatie.
