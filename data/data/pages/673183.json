They happen in November of years that end in an even number. New Hampshire and Vermont are the only states that have elections for governor every two years. Every other state has elections for governor every four years. The state's 82nd governor is Republican Chris Sununu. He became governor on January 5, 2017.\nIn New Hampshire, there are no term limits for governors. This means that the same person can be governor many times in a row. The only person to serve more than three terms since the 18th century was John Lynch. Lynch was elected to his fourth two-year term on November 2, 2010. John Taylor Gilman had been the last governor before Lynch to serve longer than six years. Lynch was governor for 14 one-year terms between 1794 and 1816.\nSomeone who wants to be governor needs to be at least 30 years old, a registered voter, and to have lived in New Hampshire for at least seven years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["official post"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Executive_branch","surface_form":"executive branch","offset":49},{"uri":"Government_of_New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire's state government","offset":69},{"uri":"Even_number","surface_form":"even number","offset":202},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":215},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":233},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":403},{"uri":"Chris_Sununu","surface_form":"Chris Sununu","offset":414},{"uri":"Term_limits","surface_form":"term limits","offset":498},{"uri":"John_Lynch","surface_form":"John Lynch","offset":668},{"uri":"John_Taylor_Gilman","surface_form":"John Taylor Gilman","offset":747},{"uri":"Voter_registration","surface_form":"registered voter","offset":972}]}
