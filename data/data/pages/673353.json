It is a community of scientists (biologists, physicists, geoscientists and chemists) who develop this new field of deep carbon science.\nIn December 2018, researchers announced that amounts of life forms are deep underground. They think 70% of bacteria and archaea on Earth (23 billion tonnes of carbon) live at least deep underground, including below the seabed.\nThere is a ten-year Deep Carbon Observatory project.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon's","offset":71},{"uri":"Biologists","surface_form":"biologists","offset":132},{"uri":"Physicists","surface_form":"physicists","offset":144},{"uri":"Geologists","surface_form":"geoscientists","offset":156},{"uri":"Chemists","surface_form":"chemists","offset":174},{"uri":"Life_form","surface_form":"life form","offset":291},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":342},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":355},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":366},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":394},{"uri":"Seabed","surface_form":"seabed","offset":454}]}
