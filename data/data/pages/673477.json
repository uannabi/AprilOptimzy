It was released on DVD the next week.\nReception.\nManohla Dargis from \"The New York Times\" gave the movie high marks. She said: \"There's enough blood in the unrated film \"Frontier(s)\" to satiate even the most ravenous gore hounds. The real surprise here is that this creepy, contemporary gross-out also has some ideas, visual and otherwise.\nRotten Tomatoes' approval rating was 55% for the movie. That was based on 20 reviews.\nJim Ridley from \"The Village Voice\", gave the movie a negative review. He said: \"Give the French a taste of neo-fascism, race riots and paramilitary crackdowns, and they seek solace in the American cinema's current favorite pastime - vigorously art-directed torture porn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Horror_movie","surface_form":"horror movie","offset":40},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":140},{"uri":"Motion_Picture_Association_of_America","surface_form":"Motion Picture Association of America","offset":199},{"uri":"Far-right_politics","surface_form":"far right","offset":375},{"uri":"President_of_the_French_Republic","surface_form":"French presidency","offset":413},{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"riot","offset":452},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":462},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":474},{"uri":"Street_gang","surface_form":"street gang","offset":483},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":506},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":762},{"uri":"Emergency_department","surface_form":"emergency room","offset":789},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":875},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":949},{"uri":"Achilles_tendon","surface_form":"Achilles tendon","offset":1221},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":1626},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1673},{"uri":"Knife","surface_form":"knife","offset":1763},{"uri":"Shotgun","surface_form":"shotgun","offset":1814},{"uri":"8_Films_to_Die_For","surface_form":"8 Films to Die For","offset":1936},{"uri":"MPAA","surface_form":"MPAA","offset":2003},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":2143},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":2194},{"uri":"Rotten_Tomatoes","surface_form":"Rotten Tomatoes","offset":2464}]}
