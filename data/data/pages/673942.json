It is a sequel to the 1964 award-winning movie \"Mary Poppins\". Like the first movie, it is also based on the book series of the same name by P. L. Travers.\nPlot.\nIn 1935 London, England, Michael Banks lives in his childhood home. He lives with his children Annabel, John and Georgie. His wife Kate died a year ago. For that reason, Ellen and Jane are helping him raise the children. However, Michael has taken out a loan from the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank to cover his expenses. William Weatherall Wilkins sends his partners to warn Michael that his house will be taken from him if he doesn't repay the loan by Friday. Michael and Jane remember their father left them shares in the bank that can cover the loan. They search the house for the certificate proving their ownership of the shares. During the search, Michael finds a kite. But there's no worth in it anymore, so he puts it out to give away.\nWhile out in the park with Annabel and John, Georgie finds the kite and tries flying it. He ends up being pulled into the sky. He then comes down with Mary Poppins. She decides to take care of the three children as their nanny. She starts off by drawing them a bath. The bath leads down to an oceanic world. Mary Poppins denies anything in fantasy happened.\nMichael goes to the bank to see if he can find proof of his shares. Wilkins, though, denies there are any records of them. Right after Michael leaves, Wilkins tears the record from the official book and burns it in the fireplace.\nThat evening, Annabel and John decide to sell their mother's \"priceless\" bowl to pay off the debt. But Georgie tries to stop them. The bowl ends up damaged because of the three fighting over it.\nThe next day, Mary Poppins and the children go and see Topsy so they can get the bowl fixed. But they find out that the bowl isn't worth much. They then head to the bank to give Michael his briefcase. When the children go to Wilkins' office to ask him for help, however, they learn he is planning to take away their house. Georgie interrupts the banker's meeting after seeing parallels between Wilkins, his associates and an animal gang who kidnapped him. When Michael arrives, he doesn't believe the children, and gets angry at them for putting the home and his job at risk. Mary Poppins takes the children home. They are guided by Jack and his fellow lamplighters.\nThe Banks family get ready to move out of their house. But as he looks at his old kite, Michael realizes that Georgie use parts of the shares certificate to cover the kite's holes. Michael and Jane head to the bank. Mary Poppins and the children go with Jack and the lamplighters to Big Ben to \"turn back time\". After scaling the clock tower, Jack and Mary turn Big Ben back five minutes. That gives Michael and Jane enough time to reach the bank. Michael and Jane reach the bank in time, though they're not successful in getting their shares because they do not have the part with the signatures on the certificates. But then, Mr. Dawes Jr. comes and expels Wilkins from the bank for corrupt practices.\nThe next day, the Banks family go to the park. They buy balloons that take them into the air. They're joined by Jack and many others, including Wilkins. But Wilkins' balloon falls to the ground. When they return home, Mary Poppins realizes it is time for her to go. Michael and Jane thank Mary as she flies back into the sky.\nBox office.\nAs of December 30, 2018, \"Mary Poppins Returns\" has made $98.9 million in the United States and Canada.
