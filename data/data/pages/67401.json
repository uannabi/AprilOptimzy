He won a Golden Globe award in 1995 for his starring role in the movie \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\". His other movies include: \"Nine Months\", \"Notting Hill\", \"Mickey Blue Eyes\", \"Bridget Jones's Diary\", \"About a Boy\", \"Love Actually\" and \"Paddington 2\".\nEarly life and ancestry.\nGrant was born at\u00A0Charing Cross Hospital\u00A0in\u00A0Hammersmith, London, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean (b.\u00A0Wickham, Hampshire, 11 October 1933; d.\u00A0Hounslow, London, July 2001) and\u00A0Captain\u00A0James Murray Grant (b. 1929). Grant's grandfather, Colonel James Murray Grant,DSO\u00A0was decorated for bravery and leadership at\u00A0Saint-Valery-en-Caux\u00A0during World War II.\nGrant's father was trained at\u00A0Sandhurst,\u00A0Berkshire\u00A0and served with the\u00A0Seaforth Highlanders\u00A0for eight years in\u00A0Malaya,\u00A0Germany\u00A0and Scotland. He ran a carpet firm, pursued hobbies such as golf and\u00A0painting watercolours, and raised his family in\u00A0Chiswick, west London, where the Grants lived next to Arlington Park Mansions on Sutton Lane.\u00A0His mother worked as a schoolteacher and taught Latin, French and music for more than 30\u00A0years in the\u00A0state schools\u00A0of west London.\u00A0She died at the age of 65, 18 months after being diagnosed with\u00A0pancreatic cancer.\nEducation.\nGrant started his education at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick but then moved to St Peter's Primary School in\u00A0Hammersmith, Grant was then educated at an independent prep school\u00A0Wetherby School. From 1969 to 1978, he attended the independent\u00A0Latymer Upper School\u00A0in Hammersmith on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket and football for the school.\nIn 1979, Grant won the Galsworthy scholarship to\u00A0New College, Oxford\u00A0where he starred in his first film,\u00A0\"Privileged\", produced by the\u00A0Oxford University Film Foundation. He studied\u00A0English literature\u00A0and graduated with\u00A02:1 honours. Actress\u00A0Anna Chancellor, who met Grant while she was still at school, has recalled, \"I first met Hugh at a party at Oxford. There was something magical about him. He was a star even then, without having done anything. Grant joined the exclusive\u00A0Piers Gaveston Society\u00A0at Oxford, a group with a reputation for debauchery and decadence.\"\nViewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet,\u00A0he joined the\u00A0Oxford University Dramatic Society\u00A0and starred in a successful touring production of\u00A0\"Twelfth Night\".\nScreen roles.\nGrant has mostly been a comedy (especially a\u00A0romantic comedy) actor for almost all of his mainstream film career. He also never ventures to play characters who are not British. While some film critics, such as\u00A0Roger Ebert, have defended the limited variety of his performances, others have dismissed him as a\u00A0one-trick pony.\u00A0Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a long-time collaborator of Grant, said, \"His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique.\" \u00A0A majority of Grant's popular films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":52},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":60},{"uri":"Golden_Globe","surface_form":"Golden Globe","offset":76},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":132},{"uri":"Four_Weddings_and_a_Funeral","surface_form":"Four Weddings and a Funeral","offset":139},{"uri":"Nine_Months","surface_form":"Nine Months","offset":196},{"uri":"Notting_Hill_(movie)","surface_form":"Notting Hill","offset":211},{"uri":"Mickey_Blue_Eyes","surface_form":"Mickey Blue Eyes","offset":227},{"uri":"Bridget_Jones%27s_Diary","surface_form":"Bridget Jones's Diary","offset":247},{"uri":"About_a_Boy","surface_form":"About a Boy","offset":272},{"uri":"Love_Actually","surface_form":"Love Actually","offset":287},{"uri":"Paddington_2","surface_form":"Paddington 2","offset":307}]}
