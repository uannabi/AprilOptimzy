{"id":674288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6gberg","text":"L\u00F6gberg, also named Law Rock, is a rocky area south west Iceland. It is where the local law making body (Althing parliament) meets. In older days, the parliment meets at \u00DEingvellir. \u00DEingvellir was very easily accessible from the towns of the south west Ireland. The area landscape is very beautiful.\nThe exact location of the L\u00F6gberg is unknown. In 1000 years, the geography of the rift valley changes a lot. Two possible locations have been identified in \u00DEingvellir. One of them is a flat ledge on top of a slope named Hallurinn (currently marked by a flagpole). The other area is in the Almannagj\u00E1 fault against a rock wall. There is a proposal to make a place in the Hestagj\u00E1 ravine the most idea location.\nThe L\u00F6gberg was the place on which the Lawspeaker (l\u00F6gs\u00F6guma\u00F0ur) took office as the chief offical of Althing. Speeches and announcements were made from the spot. Anyone attending could make their speech from the L\u00F6gberg. The parliament also starts and ends their gathering at the location.\nThe L\u00F6gberg serves as the location for the parliament since 930 A.D. It was no longer used after 1262 A.D. In 1962, Iceland was controlled by Norway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":57},{"uri":"Althing","surface_form":"Althing","offset":105},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":113},{"uri":"Althing","surface_form":"Althing","offset":811},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1142}]}
