They also believe white people are worth more than the other races.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheistic","offset":29},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white people","offset":52},{"uri":"Ben_Klassen","surface_form":"Ben Klassen","offset":75},{"uri":"Hate_group","surface_form":"hate group","offset":173},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":202},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":219},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"Nature","offset":251},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":306}]}
