{"id":6744,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Belushi","text":"John Belushi (January 24, 1949 - March 5, 1982) was an American actor in movies and television shows.\nBelushi was born in Chicago, Illinois. His mother was the daughter of Albanian immigrants; his father was an immigrant from Albania. His brother is James Belushi, who is also an actor.\nJohn was co-captain of the football team in high school as well as homecoming king in his senior year. In school he was already active in acting, but wanted to become a baseball-coach. His drama-teacher persuaded him to pursue becoming a professional actor.\nHe appeared mainly in TV shows, and was one of the founders of \"Saturday Night Live\". His \"Blues Brothers\" act with Dan Aykroyd was famous, long before \"The Blues Brothers\" movie (1980).\nUnfortunately Belushi became a drug addict. He used both heroin and cocaine, and a lot of both. When \"The Blues Brothers\" was made, he spent about US$40,000 to $75,000 a month on drugs.\nJohn Belushi died in 1982 from a drug overdose injected by Cathy Smith. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":55},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":64},{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":73},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television shows","offset":84},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":122},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":131},{"uri":"Albania","surface_form":"Albania","offset":172},{"uri":"Immigrant","surface_form":"immigrant","offset":181},{"uri":"James_Belushi","surface_form":"James Belushi","offset":250},{"uri":"American_football","surface_form":"football","offset":314},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":331},{"uri":"Homecoming","surface_form":"homecoming","offset":354},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":456},{"uri":"Coach_(sport)","surface_form":"coach","offset":465},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":476},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":482},{"uri":"TV","surface_form":"TV","offset":567},{"uri":"Founder","surface_form":"founders","offset":596},{"uri":"Saturday_Night_Live","surface_form":"Saturday Night Live","offset":609},{"uri":"Dan_Aykroyd","surface_form":"Dan Aykroyd","offset":661},{"uri":"The_Blues_Brothers","surface_form":"The Blues Brothers","offset":698},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":763},{"uri":"Addiction","surface_form":"addict","offset":768},{"uri":"Heroin","surface_form":"heroin","offset":789},{"uri":"Cocaine","surface_form":"cocaine","offset":800},{"uri":"US%24","surface_form":"US$","offset":879},{"uri":"Overdose","surface_form":"overdose","offset":956},{"uri":"Cathy_Smith","surface_form":"Cathy Smith","offset":977},{"uri":"Manslaughter","surface_form":"manslaughter","offset":1023}]}
