{"id":67444,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism","text":"Surrealism was an art and cultural movement which began in the early 1920s.\nThe movement grew out of Dadaism. This was, amid the horrors of World War I, a protest at the meaninglessness of civilised life.\nAt the same time, the work of Sigmund Freud began to filter through, and affect the literary and art worlds. Andr\u00E9 Breton was trained in psychiatry, and during the war, he worked in a hospital where he used Freud's methods on shell-shock patients. Not surprisingly, Breton influenced many writers and artists after the war.\nFreud's work placed emphasis on the subconscious mind, and its role in steering behaviour and emotion. His way of using free association, and dream analysis to get a clue to the subconscious was picked up by the surrealists. They painted dreamlike fantasies, and practised automatic drawing without sight: 'automatism'.\nBreton discussed his first encounter with the surreal, in a description of a hypnagogic state, in which a strange phrase inexplicably appeared in his mind: \"There is a man cut in two by the window\". This phrase illustrates Breton's view of Surrealism as two distant realities brought together to create a new, uncanny union.\nSurrealist works have an element of surprise: unexpected items are placed next to each other for no clear reason. Many Surrealist artists and writers see their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost. The works are an artifact, and Andr\u00E9 Breton said that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. From the 1920s in Paris it spread around the globe. It influenced films such as the \"Angel's Egg\" and \"El Topo\".\nArtists.\nMax Ernst, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, Andr\u00E9 Masson, Joan Mir\u00F3 and Marcel Duchamp were some of the best-known surrealist artists.\nSurrealist films.\nMan Ray made the first surrealist film: \"Return to reason\" (1923). Luis Bu\u00F1uel and Dali made two well-known surrealist films: \"Un chien andalou\" (1929) and \"L'\u00C2ge d'or\" (1930). Jean Cocteau made three films, known as the \"Orphic Trilogy\": \"Le Sang d'un po\u00E8te\" (1930), \"Orph\u00E9e\" (1950) and \"Testament of Orpheus\" (1960), which includes a cameo appearance by Pablo Picasso.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":18},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":26},{"uri":"Dadaism","surface_form":"Dadaism","offset":101},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":140},{"uri":"Sigmund_Freud","surface_form":"Sigmund Freud","offset":235},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Breton","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Breton","offset":314},{"uri":"Psychiatry","surface_form":"psychiatry","offset":342},{"uri":"Combat_stress_reaction","surface_form":"shell-shock","offset":431},{"uri":"Unconscious_mind","surface_form":"subconscious","offset":565},{"uri":"Behaviour","surface_form":"behaviour","offset":609},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":623},{"uri":"Free_association_(psychology)","surface_form":"free association","offset":649},{"uri":"Dream_interepretation","surface_form":"dream analysis","offset":671},{"uri":"Fantasy","surface_form":"fantasies","offset":777},{"uri":"Surrealist_automatism","surface_form":"automatism'","offset":836},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":1487},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1529},{"uri":"Max_Ernst","surface_form":"Max Ernst","offset":1633},{"uri":"Salvador_Dali","surface_form":"Salvador Dali","offset":1644},{"uri":"Man_Ray","surface_form":"Man Ray","offset":1659},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Masson","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Masson","offset":1668},{"uri":"Joan_Mir%C3%B3","surface_form":"Joan Mir\u00F3","offset":1682},{"uri":"Marcel_Duchamp","surface_form":"Marcel Duchamp","offset":1696},{"uri":"Luis_Bu%C3%B1uel","surface_form":"Luis Bu\u00F1uel","offset":1844},{"uri":"Jean_Cocteau","surface_form":"Jean Cocteau","offset":1954},{"uri":"Pablo_Picasso","surface_form":"Pablo Picasso","offset":2133}]}
