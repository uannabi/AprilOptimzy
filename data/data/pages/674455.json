Although it had been founded as the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway (BAGS), it was almost immediately called the Ferrocarril del Sud. The Bajo Hondo station was one of the 504 active stations that the company had until its nationalization. During the presidency of General Juan Domingo Per\u00F3n, that company was renamed General Roca Railroad until today.\nThe date of inauguration of this station also doubles as the birth date of the Bajo hondo town.\nSince the privatizations of the state-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos in the 90's, the Bajo hondo train station stopped providing services to passengers.\nThe building at the station has a certain degree of deterioration, and is currently used as a private home.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bajo_Hondo_Train_Station","surface_form":"Bajo Hondo Train Station","offset":58},{"uri":"Train_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":101},{"uri":"Coronel_Rosales","surface_form":"Coronel Rosales","offset":146},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires_Province","surface_form":"Province of Buenos Aires","offset":183},{"uri":"Bah%C3%ADa_Blanca","surface_form":"Bah\u00EDa Blanca","offset":328}]}
