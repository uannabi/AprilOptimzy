{"id":67447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pim_Fortuyn","text":"Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn (, 19 February 1948 \u2013 6 May 2002) was a Dutch sociologist and politician. He was born in Driehuis. He was the leader of the LPF (\"Lijst Pim Fortuyn\"), a right-wing political party. He was very popular and was expected to win the 2002 elections. Fortuyn did not agree with some things the religion of Islam does, and did not want to let criminal Muslims from other countries come to the Netherlands. He was Roman Catholic and openly gay.\nNine days before the elections, Fortuyn was assassinated during the 2002 Dutch national election campaign by Volkert van der Graaf, who is an extreme environmentalist and animal rights activist. In court at his trial, van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" and targeting \"the weak members of society\" in seeking political power.\nEarly life and education.\nFortuyn was born on 19 February 1948 in Driehuis, as the third child to a Catholic family. His father worked as a salesman and his mother was a housewife. In 1967 he began to study sociology at the University of Amsterdam but transferred after a few months to the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. In 1971 he ended his study with the Academic degree Doctorandus. In 1981 he received a doctorate in sociology at the University of Groningen as a Doctor of Philosophy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":94},{"uri":"Sociologist","surface_form":"sociologist","offset":100},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politician","offset":116},{"uri":"Driehuis","surface_form":"Driehuis","offset":143},{"uri":"LPF","surface_form":"LPF","offset":178},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":207},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":218},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":288},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":342},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":354},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":399},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"come to","offset":428},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":460},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":486},{"uri":"2002_Dutch_general_election","surface_form":"2002 Dutch national election campaign","offset":559},{"uri":"Volkert_van_der_Graaf","surface_form":"Volkert van der Graaf","offset":600},{"uri":"Animal_rights","surface_form":"animal rights","offset":662},{"uri":"Driehuis","surface_form":"Driehuis","offset":938},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":1079},{"uri":"University_of_Amsterdam","surface_form":"University of Amsterdam","offset":1096},{"uri":"Vrije_Universiteit","surface_form":"Vrije Universiteit","offset":1162},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"Academic degree","offset":1231},{"uri":"Doctorandus","surface_form":"Doctorandus","offset":1247},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":1295},{"uri":"University_of_Groningen","surface_form":"University of Groningen","offset":1312}]}
