{"id":674539,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra","text":"Petra (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062A\u0631\u0627\u0621, \"Al-Batr\u0101\u02BE\"; Ancient Greek: \u03A0\u03AD\u03C4\u03C1\u03B1) is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan.\nIt is in a basin among the mountains that run from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.\nHistory.\nPetra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000\u00A0BC. It became the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who used Petra because it was near the spice trade routes.\nThe Nabataean Kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC. iIn 106 AD they lost their independence. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes developed. Also, the 363 earthquake destroyed many structures.\nThe Byzantine Era led to the construction of several Christian churches, but the city continued to decline. By the early Islamic era only a handful of nomads lived in Petra. It stayed unknown to the world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.\nUNESCO Status.\nPetra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described it as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\".\nPetra is Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked to half a million in the first quarter of 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["UNESCO World Heritage Site"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":7},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":37},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":111},{"uri":"Basin_(geology)","surface_form":"basin","offset":130},{"uri":"Dead_Sea","surface_form":"Dead Sea","offset":174},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Aqaba","surface_form":"Gulf of Aqaba","offset":190},{"uri":"BC","surface_form":"BC","offset":271},{"uri":"Nabataean_Kingdom","surface_form":"Nabataean Kingdom","offset":309},{"uri":"Nomadic","surface_form":"nomadic","offset":348},{"uri":"Arabs","surface_form":"Arabs","offset":356},{"uri":"Spice_trade","surface_form":"spice trade","offset":401},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":472},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":518},{"uri":"Galilee_earthquake_of_363","surface_form":"363 earthquake","offset":620},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Era","offset":666},{"uri":"Johann_Ludwig_Burckhardt","surface_form":"Johann Ludwig Burckhardt","offset":904},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":962},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":969},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":1112}]}
