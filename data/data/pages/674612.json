He worked in number theory at University of Cambridge. He was best known for his part in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. This related algebraic properties of elliptic curves to special values of L-functions. Also, he worked on the Titan operating system.\nIn his youth, Swinnerton-Dyer was an international bridge player. He played for the British team twice in the European Open teams championship, in 1953 and 1962.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":127},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":135},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":163},{"uri":"University_of_Cambridge","surface_form":"University of Cambridge","offset":180},{"uri":"Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture","surface_form":"Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture","offset":243},{"uri":"Elliptic_curve","surface_form":"elliptic curve","offset":318},{"uri":"L-function","surface_form":"L-function","offset":355},{"uri":"Titan_(computer)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":391},{"uri":"Contract_bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":466}]}
