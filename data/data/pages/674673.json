It was formed by Allan Clarke and Graham Nash in 1962 in Manchester.\nTheir best known songs were \"Bus Stop\", \"Just One Look\", \"Look Through Any Window\", \"I Can't Let Go\", \"Bus Stop\", \"Stop Stop Stop\", \"On a Carousel\", \"Carrie Anne\", \"Jennifer Eccles\", and later \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\", and \"The Air That I Breathe\".\nThey are one of the few British groups of the early 1960s, along with the Rolling Stones, that have never disbanded and continue to record and perform. The Hollies were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Allan_Clarke_(singer)","surface_form":"Allan Clarke","offset":239},{"uri":"Graham_Nash","surface_form":"Graham Nash","offset":256},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":279},{"uri":"Bus_Stop_(song)","surface_form":"Bus Stop","offset":320},{"uri":"Just_One_Look_(song)","surface_form":"Just One Look","offset":332},{"uri":"Look_Through_Any_Window","surface_form":"Look Through Any Window","offset":349},{"uri":"I_Can%27t_Let_Go","surface_form":"I Can't Let Go","offset":376},{"uri":"Bus_Stop_(song)","surface_form":"Bus Stop","offset":394},{"uri":"Stop_Stop_Stop","surface_form":"Stop Stop Stop","offset":406},{"uri":"On_a_Carousel","surface_form":"On a Carousel","offset":424},{"uri":"Carrie_Anne","surface_form":"Carrie Anne","offset":441},{"uri":"Jennifer_Eccles","surface_form":"Jennifer Eccles","offset":456},{"uri":"He_Ain%27t_Heavy%2C_He%27s_My_Brother","surface_form":"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother","offset":485},{"uri":"Long_Cool_Woman_in_a_Black_Dress","surface_form":"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress","offset":520},{"uri":"The_Air_That_I_Breathe","surface_form":"The Air That I Breathe","offset":560},{"uri":"The_Rolling_Stones","surface_form":"the Rolling Stones","offset":655},{"uri":"Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame","offset":772}]}
