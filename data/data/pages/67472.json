{"id":67472,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage_device","text":"A data storage device is a device for recording (storing) information (data). Recording can be done using virtually any form of energy. People have been storing data for thousands of years, by picture<nowiki/>s and writing. Modern storage device may hold information, process information, or both. Most often the term is used with computers. Data storage devices can permanently hold data, like files.\n\"Electronic data storage\" is storage which requires electricity to store and get back that data. Most storage devices that do not require visual optics to read data fall into this category. Electronic data may be stored in either an analog or digital signal format.\nTerminology.\nAn organic brain may or may not be considered a data storage device.\nAll information is data. However, not all data is information.\nRecording medium.\nA recording medium is a physical material that holds data expressed in any of the existing recording formats. With electronic media, the data and the recording medium is sometimes referred to as \"software\" despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Device","surface_form":"device","offset":27},{"uri":"Recording","surface_form":"recording","offset":38},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":58},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":128},{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":193},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":215},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":331},{"uri":"Computer_file","surface_form":"file","offset":395},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":454},{"uri":"Visual_perception","surface_form":"visual","offset":540},{"uri":"Analog_signal","surface_form":"analog","offset":635},{"uri":"Digital","surface_form":"digital","offset":645},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":692},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":800},{"uri":"Recording_formats","surface_form":"recording formats","offset":922},{"uri":"Electronic_media","surface_form":"electronic media","offset":946},{"uri":"Computer_software","surface_form":"computer software","offset":1089}]}
