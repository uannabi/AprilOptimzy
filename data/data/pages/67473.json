{"id":67473,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief","text":"Relief is a way of making sculptures or carvings. You start with a flat stone or wooden base, and take small parts away until you have made the art you want.\nReliefs are found around the world. They can be used to decorate buildings, such as temples. Usually the artist makes reliefs of figures, such as people or animals.\nIn bas-relief, only a bit of the base is taken away. The figure is quite flat and this is especially common in friezes. An alto-relief is where the artist takes away a lot of the base material. This can be very detailed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":26},{"uri":"Carving","surface_form":"carving","offset":40},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":242},{"uri":"Bas-relief","surface_form":"bas-relief","offset":326},{"uri":"Frieze","surface_form":"frieze","offset":434}]}
