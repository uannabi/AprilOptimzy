It was very successful, with 607 DC-3s being built. Even today, some companies still use DC-3\u2019s despite better jet planes being for sale.\nIt was basically a longer version of Douglas\u2019s earlier airplane, the DC-2. It was revolutionary to the airplane market when the DC-3 started being built in 1936, as it could fly farther than most aircraft at the time.\nDuring WW2, a military version of the DC-3 known as the C-47 \u201CSkytrain\u201D was the primary transport of the US Military. It was used in major events like D-Day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Douglas","surface_form":"Douglas","offset":70},{"uri":"Douglas_DC-2","surface_form":"DC-2","offset":286},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"WW2","offset":442},{"uri":"Douglas_C-47_Skytrain","surface_form":"C-47 \u201CSkytrain\u201D","offset":491},{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"US Military","offset":540},{"uri":"Normandy_landings","surface_form":"D-Day","offset":586}]}
