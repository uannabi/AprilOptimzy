{"id":675375,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN","text":"OpenVPN is a VPN protocol that utilizes an open-source code. This means the source code is openly available for anyone to access and develop.\nAn active community has formed around the OpenVPN project, which has kept it up-to-date and provided regular security audits to ensure it\u2019s viability.\nIt is particularly known for its security and privacy as well as its adjustability.\nOpenVPN typically works on any port and has five encryption algorithms to such as SSL, IPSec or SSH\nFor the best security and privacy, you should use AES 256-bit encryption, which is essentially unbreakable and should also use a TCP 443 port.\nThe TCP 443 port will make your connection similar to an https connection. It is essentially a secure connection which can help prevent website blocking and can help you bypass censorship.\nFor greater speed, it is recommended to use UDP ports, and you can select the default, Blowfish-128 cipher. This isn\u2019t the absolute highest level of security, but for most people, it will suffice and will operate significantly faster than AES 256 on TCP.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Open_source","surface_form":"open-source code","offset":43},{"uri":"Algorithms","surface_form":"algorithms","offset":437},{"uri":"Secure_Sockets_Layer","surface_form":"SSL","offset":459},{"uri":"IPsec","surface_form":"IPSec","offset":464},{"uri":"SSH","surface_form":"SSH","offset":473},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":539},{"uri":"Network_port","surface_form":"TCP 443 port","offset":606},{"uri":"Blowfish_(cipher)","surface_form":"Blowfish-128 cipher","offset":896}]}
