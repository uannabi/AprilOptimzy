{"id":675579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_crisis","text":"From early January 2019, Venezuela has been experiencing a Presidential crisis, with unclear leadership and terms of Presidency.\nDespite encouragement to resign as president when his first term expired on 10 January 2019, Nicol\u00E1s Maduro inaugurated himself. This resulted in widespread condemnation, the National Assembly invoking a State of emergency, and nations removing their embassies from Venezuela. With their belief that his election was illegitimate, they claimed that by retaking power, Maduro was converting Venezuela into an illegal \"de facto\" dictatorship.\nJuan Guaid\u00F3, the newly appointed President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, began motions to form a transitional government as soon as he took the National Assembly role on 5 January 2019; whether Maduro took office on the 10th or not, the country would not have a legitimately elected president. On behalf of the National Assembly, he became one of the first to denounce Maduro taking office, saying that the country had fallen into a \"de facto\" dictatorship and had no leader, and that they were in a state of emergency.\nMaduro's government states that the crisis is a \"coup d'\u00E9tat\" led by the United States to remove him from power and control the country's oil reserves.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["military conflict"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":25},{"uri":"President_of_Venezuela","surface_form":"Presidency","offset":117},{"uri":"Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro","surface_form":"Nicol\u00E1s Maduro","offset":222},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":546},{"uri":"Juan_Guaid%C3%B3","surface_form":"Juan Guaid\u00F3","offset":570},{"uri":"President_of_the_National_Assembly_of_Venezuela","surface_form":"President of the National Assembly of Venezuela","offset":603},{"uri":"Transitional_government","surface_form":"transitional government","offset":676},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":1013},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":1148}]}
