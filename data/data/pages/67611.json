{"id":67611,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento","text":"is a meal common in Japanese cuisine, made to take away to be eaten somewhere else. A traditional bento consists of rice, fish or meat, and one or more pickled or cooked vegetables as a side dish. Containers for bento may be very different, from disposable mass produced to handcrafted lacquerware. While bento meals can be bought at many stores and in all of Japan, it is still considered a very important skill for a Japanese housewife to be able to prepare a good boxed lunch.\nBento can be very elaborate, aesthetically pleasing cuisine arrangements. Often the food is arranged in such a way as to resemble other objects: dolls, flowers, leaves, and so forth. For some special occasions like hanami, more elaborate and bigger bentos are prepared. People often take bento for a picnic.\nTypes of bento.\nBento are often sold in train stations. These are called ekiben (\u99C5\u5F01). Also,Bento are sold in airports. These are called Soraben (\u7A7A\u5F01).Kyaraben (\u30AD\u30E3\u30E9\u5F01), is a shortened form of the two words \"character\" and \"bento\" and is becoming more popular.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Meal","surface_form":"meal","offset":5},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":20},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":29},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":116},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":122},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":130},{"uri":"Pickling","surface_form":"pickled","offset":152},{"uri":"Cooking","surface_form":"cooked","offset":163},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":170},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"Container","offset":197},{"uri":"Disposable","surface_form":"disposable","offset":246},{"uri":"Mass_production","surface_form":"mass produce","offset":257},{"uri":"Lacquer","surface_form":"lacquer","offset":286},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":360},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"skill","offset":407},{"uri":"Housewife","surface_form":"housewife","offset":428},{"uri":"Lunchbox","surface_form":"boxed lunch","offset":467},{"uri":"Aesthetics","surface_form":"aesthetically","offset":509},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":532},{"uri":"Hanami","surface_form":"hanami","offset":695},{"uri":"Picnic","surface_form":"picnic","offset":780},{"uri":"Ekiben","surface_form":"ekiben","offset":861}]}
