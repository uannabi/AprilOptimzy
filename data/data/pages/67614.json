{"id":67614,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown","text":"A clown is a kind of entertainer, or performance artist, who performs physical comedy and stunts to amuse others. They usually wear grease paint makeup that hides their real face, a large wig with brightly-colored hair, and baggy, padded clothing.\nMany clowns belong to a circus, while others freelance or have a talent agent who helps them find work. Some clowns study at a clown college or clown school, where they learn acrobatics, juggling and other physical skills, and ways to interact with an audience. Others learn from experienced clowns, or through study and practice.\nClowns in popular culture.\nClowns are sometimes mentioned in other forms of entertainment. \"Pagliacci\" is an opera by Ruggero Leoncavallo, about clowns. This theme was borrowed by Smokey Robinson, when he wrote \"The Tears of a Clown\" working with Stevie Wonder. Red Skelton was a popular entertainer, who performed clown routines on television.\nRonald McDonald is a clown character who is the mascot of McDonald's restaurants. (Jeff Giuliano, who performed Ronald for many years on television, later became a vegetarian.)\nIn many different media, clowns are often villains due to the possibility of them being creepy. Examples are Pennywise from Stephen King's It and the Joker from the Batman universe.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Entertainer","surface_form":"entertainer","offset":21},{"uri":"Performing_arts","surface_form":"performance artist","offset":37},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":79},{"uri":"Stunt","surface_form":"stunt","offset":90},{"uri":"Grease_paint","surface_form":"grease paint","offset":132},{"uri":"Makeup","surface_form":"makeup","offset":145},{"uri":"Wig","surface_form":"wig","offset":188},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":238},{"uri":"Circus","surface_form":"circus","offset":272},{"uri":"Freelance","surface_form":"freelance","offset":293},{"uri":"Talent_agent","surface_form":"talent agent","offset":313},{"uri":"Acrobatics","surface_form":"acrobatics","offset":423},{"uri":"Juggling","surface_form":"juggling","offset":435},{"uri":"Interact","surface_form":"interact","offset":483},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":655},{"uri":"Pagliacci","surface_form":"Pagliacci","offset":671},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":688},{"uri":"Ruggero_Leoncavallo","surface_form":"Ruggero Leoncavallo","offset":697},{"uri":"Smokey_Robinson","surface_form":"Smokey Robinson","offset":759},{"uri":"Stevie_Wonder","surface_form":"Stevie Wonder","offset":826},{"uri":"Red_Skelton","surface_form":"Red Skelton","offset":841},{"uri":"Ronald_McDonald","surface_form":"Ronald McDonald","offset":924},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":972},{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":982},{"uri":"Vegetarian","surface_form":"vegetarian","offset":1088},{"uri":"Villain","surface_form":"villains","offset":1143},{"uri":"It_(character)","surface_form":"Pennywise","offset":1210},{"uri":"Stephen_King","surface_form":"Stephen King's","offset":1225},{"uri":"It_(novel)","surface_form":"It","offset":1240},{"uri":"Joker_(comics)","surface_form":"Joker","offset":1251},{"uri":"Batman","surface_form":"Batman","offset":1266}]}
