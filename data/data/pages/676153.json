Their victims include gulls, terns, puffins, and penguins.\nSkuas nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions. They travel a long way to migrate, and have even been seen at the South Pole.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":21},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":34},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":75},{"uri":"Seabird","surface_form":"seabird","offset":200},{"uri":"Gull","surface_form":"gull","offset":232},{"uri":"Tern","surface_form":"tern","offset":239},{"uri":"Puffin","surface_form":"puffin","offset":246},{"uri":"Penguin","surface_form":"penguin","offset":259},{"uri":"Temperate","surface_form":"temperate","offset":297},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"arctic","offset":311},{"uri":"Migrate","surface_form":"migrate","offset":353},{"uri":"South_Pole","surface_form":"South Pole","offset":393}]}
