{"id":67622,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku","text":"e=\"preserve\"> is a type of Japanese poetry. Previously called \"hokku\", haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\nThe traditional hokku usually was written in six verses or more or less 5, 7, 5 syllables and they had to follow (\"on-ji\"). The Japanese word \"cow\", meaning \"sound\", corresponds to a \"mora\", a phonetic unit similar but not identical to the syllable of a language such as English. A haiku has a special \"season word\" (the \"kigo\") to represent the season in which the poem is set, or a reference to the natural world.\nHaiku usually breaks in three parts, called \"kireji\", normally placed at the end of the first five or second seven \"morae\". In Japanese, there are actual kireji words. In English, kireji is often replaced with commas, hyphens, elipses, or breaks in the haiku. Japanese haiku are normally written in one line, while English language haiku are traditionally separated into three lines.\nIn Japanese, nouns do not have different singular and plural forms, so \"haiku\" is used as both a singular and plural noun in English as well.\nExamples.\nJapanese hokku and haiku are traditionally printed in one vertical line.\nNon-Japanese poets.\nAll of the poets below have some haiku. However, only Hackett and Virgilio are known for writing haiku. Richard Wright wrote some 4000 haiku in the last eighteen months of his life. Amiri Baraka recently wrote a collection of what he calls \"low coup.\" This is his own version of haiku. Poet Sonia Sanchez is also known for putting together haiku and the blues musical genre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":27},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":36},{"uri":"Masaoka_Shiki","surface_form":"Masaoka Shiki","offset":127},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":159},{"uri":"Syllable","surface_form":"syllable","offset":253},{"uri":"Phonetics","surface_form":"phonetic","offset":366},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":444},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"natural","offset":574},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":976},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":986},{"uri":"Singular","surface_form":"singular","offset":1014},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":1027},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1098}]}
