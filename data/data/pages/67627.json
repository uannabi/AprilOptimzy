{"id":67627,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiri_Baraka","text":"Amiri Baraka (October 7, 1934 \u2013 January 9, 2014) was an American writer. He has written poetry, drama, essays and music criticism. He is also the father of Newark city mayor Ras Baraka.\nRacism.\nBaraka's writings have made controversy over the years, mostly because of his advocacy of rape and violence towards (at many times) women, gay people, white people, and Jews. Critics of his work have said such words are examples of racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism in his work.\nMost American white men are trained to be fags. For this reason it is no wonder their faces are weak and blank. \u2026 The average ofay [white person] thinks of the black man as potentially raping every white lady in sight. Which is true, in the sense that the black man should want to rob the white man of everything he has. But for most whites the guilt of the robbery is the guilt of rape. That is, they know in their deepest hearts that they should be robbed, and the white woman understands that only in the rape sequence is she likely to get cleanly, viciously popped.\nDeath.\nBaraka died January 9, 2014 in Newark, New Jersey after being hospitalized in the facility's intensive care unit for one month prior to his death. He was 79 years old. The cause of death was complications of surgery. Baraka had diabetes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":56},{"uri":"Newark%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Newark","offset":156},{"uri":"Ras_Baraka","surface_form":"Ras Baraka","offset":174},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversy","offset":222},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":284},{"uri":"Homophobia","surface_form":"homophobia","offset":442},{"uri":"Anti-Semitism","surface_form":"anti-Semitism","offset":458},{"uri":"Faggot_(slang)","surface_form":"fags","offset":527},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"raping","offset":670},{"uri":"Intensive_care_unit","surface_form":"intensive care unit","offset":1155},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":1290}]}
