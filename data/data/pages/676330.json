It is at the center of a planetary nebula. Sakurai's Object and other similar stars are expected to end up as helium-rich white dwarfs. They go through a \"born-again\" giant phase back to the white dwarf cooling track.\nSakuri's Object was discovered in 1996.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":54},{"uri":"Sagittarius_(constellation)","surface_form":"Sagittarius","offset":66},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":78},{"uri":"White_dwarf","surface_form":"white dwarf","offset":116},{"uri":"Red_giant","surface_form":"red giant","offset":154},{"uri":"Planetary_nebula","surface_form":"planetary nebula","offset":190},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":275}]}
