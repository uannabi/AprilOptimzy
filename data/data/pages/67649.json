{"id":67649,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams_Jr.","text":"Randall Hank Williams (born in 1949 in Louisiana) is an American musician and songwriter. He is the son of country music legend Hank Williams. His nickname is \"Bocephus\", given to him by his father. He has a half-sister, named Jett Williams.\nFrom his boyhood, Hank Jr., performed his father's music publicly, because many people were still interested in it, and Hank Sr.'s career was cut short by alcohol and drug abuse. Young Williams wanted to perform music of his own, and to have his own musical career apart from his father's, but it was hard to \"get out from his father's shadow\", and be recognized for his own talents.\nIn time, Williams met musicians who liked him for his own ideas, and helped him to develop his own kind of music. He was able to become an original writer and performer, while still being proud to be Hank Sr.'s son. Some of his father's fans were sad that he wanted to do this, but others understood. He also gained new fans, performing his new music.\nSome of Williams's songs are \"Eleven Roses\", \"Family Tradition\", \"Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound\", \"All My Rowdy Friends\", and \"A Country Boy Can Survive\". Even though he had hit records and many fans, it took years for people in country music to accept him and his chosen style. Williams lost out on many awards he could have earned. Finally in the 1980s, he began to win awards as a country performer.\nIn the 1990s, Williams recorded a with his father, by using an old recording, and the two appeared together in a music video through electronic editing.\nIn 2005, Williams donated $125,000 to relief efforts in Mississippi, after Hurricane Katrina. He continues to record and to perform.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":39},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":56},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":65},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":78},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":107},{"uri":"Hank_Williams","surface_form":"Hank Williams","offset":128},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":397},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":409},{"uri":"Award","surface_form":"award","offset":1281},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":1492},{"uri":"Relief","surface_form":"relief","offset":1570},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":1588},{"uri":"Hurricane_Katrina","surface_form":"Hurricane Katrina","offset":1607}]}
