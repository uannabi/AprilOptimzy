She made the announcement on January 15, 2019, in an appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\". The campaign accepted donations from individuals and refuses political action committee donations.\nHer view on guns clearly changed after the 2012 school shooting. It is reported that the pro-gun organization changed from \"we like her\" to \"we hate her\". After the announcement, she fights against that pro-gun organization directly by a tweet. She says mass shootings is a real national emergency.\nIn a Twitter video post on March 17, 2019, Gillibrand announced that she was officially running for president.\nAfter failing to qualify for the third debate in September, Gillibrand ended her campaign on August 28, 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","surface_form":"Kirsten Gillibrand","offset":0},{"uri":"Seniority_in_the_United_States_Senate","surface_form":"junior","offset":24},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"Senator","offset":31},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":44},{"uri":"Troy%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Troy, New York","offset":110},{"uri":"Exploratory_committee","surface_form":"exploratory committee","offset":262},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic nomination","offset":315},{"uri":"2020_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"2020 United States presidential election","offset":344},{"uri":"The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert","surface_form":"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert","offset":454},{"uri":"Donation","surface_form":"donation","offset":513},{"uri":"Political_action_committee","surface_form":"political action committee","offset":552},{"uri":"Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting","surface_form":"2012 school shooting","offset":633},{"uri":"National_Rifle_Association","surface_form":"pro-gun organization","offset":679},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"tweet","offset":828}]}
