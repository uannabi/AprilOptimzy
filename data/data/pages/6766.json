When he was small, his father gave him a little kart. It had a small motor bike engine in it. He started getting interest from that time.\nPre-F1 career.\nIn 1984 Michael won the German Kart Championship and went on to win many more. In 1987 he won the German and European Kart Championship.

He impressed many fans as he qualified 7th on a track where he had never previously(before) driven with an inferior car. At the start he burnt the clutch and retired.\nBenetton (1991-1995).\nHe was quickly snapped up by Benetton and finished in 5th place at the Italian Grand Prix.\nHe followed it up with 6th in both Portugal and at the then new Circuit de Catalunya in Spain. He then crashed out in Japan and spun in the torrential rain at the season finale in Australia. In the 6 races he entered, he scored 4 points and 14th in the championship.\n1992.\nHe started the season off well with 4th in South Africa followed by his maiden podium finish in 3rd at the Mexican Grand Prix.
