The last episode aired on December 18, 2014. It was a spin-off of \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". Colbert acts as if he is very conservative, as a parody. His show makes fun of different conservative political commentary shows, especially Bill O'Reilly's show \"The O'Reilly Factor\" on Fox News. The show also has many guests, usually one each night on the last part of his show. They are authors, actors, politicians, musicians and others. He also sometimes has other guests in other segments in his show, such as Congress members in his \"Better Know a District\" segment. The show is directed by Jim Hoskinson.\nColbert has also written three books with the writers of his show. The first book from 2007 is called \"I Am America (And So Can You!)\" as the character he plays on television.\nThe show is aired in Canada on The Comedy Network, The Comedy Channel in Australia, and Comedy Central in New Zealand.\nThe show won two Emmy Awards in 2013. It ended in December 2014.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":28},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":37},{"uri":"Talk_show","surface_form":"talk show","offset":48},{"uri":"Stephen_Colbert","surface_form":"Stephen Colbert","offset":67},{"uri":"Comedy_Central","surface_form":"Comedy Central","offset":100},{"uri":"Spin-off","surface_form":"spin-off","offset":216},{"uri":"The_Daily_Show","surface_form":"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart","offset":229},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservative","offset":293},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parody","offset":312},{"uri":"Conservatives_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"conservative","offset":352},{"uri":"Commentary","surface_form":"commentary","offset":375},{"uri":"Bill_O%27Reilly","surface_form":"Bill O'Reilly","offset":404},{"uri":"The_O%27Reilly_Factor","surface_form":"The O'Reilly Factor","offset":426},{"uri":"Fox_News","surface_form":"Fox News","offset":450},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":553},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":562},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":570},{"uri":"Musicians","surface_form":"musicians","offset":583},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"Congress","offset":679},{"uri":"Television_director","surface_form":"direct","offset":749},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":918},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":973},{"uri":"The_Comedy_Network","surface_form":"The Comedy Network","offset":983},{"uri":"The_Comedy_Channel","surface_form":"The Comedy Channel","offset":1003},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1025},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":1058},{"uri":"Emmy_Awards","surface_form":"Emmy Awards","offset":1088}]}
