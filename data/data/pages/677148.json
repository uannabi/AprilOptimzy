Harris has been discussed throughout 2018 and 2019 as a potential top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.\nHarris was the fifth office-holding Democrat to formally announce a campaign in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, joining former Congressman John Delaney, former West Virginia State Sen. Richard Ojeda, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, and former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.\nIf elected, Harris would have become the first female and Asian American to ever become President of the United States. Harris was the third black woman to seek the Democratic nomination for president, the first two being Shirley Chisholm and Carol Moseley Braun.\nCampaign headquarters was in Baltimore, Maryland, with a second office in Oakland, California.\nHarris ended her campaign on December 3, 2019 after falling low in poll numbers and campaign money raised.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["U.S. federal election campaign"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kamala_Harris","surface_form":"Kamala Harris","offset":34},{"uri":"Seniority_in_the_United_States_Senate","surface_form":"junior","offset":53},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":60},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":87},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries%2C_2020","surface_form":"2020 Democratic nomination for president","offset":232},{"uri":"2020_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"2020 U.S. presidential election","offset":358},{"uri":"John_Delaney","surface_form":"John Delaney","offset":418},{"uri":"Richard_Ojeda","surface_form":"Richard Ojeda","offset":464},{"uri":"Tulsi_Gabbard","surface_form":"Tulsi Gabbard","offset":493},{"uri":"United_States_Secretary_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development","surface_form":"U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development","offset":519},{"uri":"Julian_Castro","surface_form":"Julian Castro","offset":567},{"uri":"Asian_American","surface_form":"Asian American","offset":640},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":670},{"uri":"Shirley_Chisholm","surface_form":"Shirley Chisholm","offset":804},{"uri":"Carol_Moseley_Braun","surface_form":"Carol Moseley Braun","offset":825},{"uri":"Baltimore","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":875},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":886},{"uri":"Oakland%2C_California","surface_form":"Oakland, California","offset":920}]}
