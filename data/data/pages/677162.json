{"id":677162,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid","text":"Negroid was a word for a person from Sub-Saharan Africa. The group of these persons was called \"Negroid race\". In former times, many people divided human beings into three races. These races were called \"Negroid\", \"Mongoloid\", and \"Caucasoid\". Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong.\nFeatures such as a wider nose, curly hair, and dark skin were seen as typical for the Negroid race.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"Sub-Saharan Africa","offset":37},{"uri":"Human_beings","surface_form":"human beings","offset":148},{"uri":"Historical_definitions_of_race","surface_form":"races","offset":172},{"uri":"Mongoloid","surface_form":"Mongoloid","offset":215},{"uri":"Caucasian_race","surface_form":"Caucasoid","offset":232},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":310}]}
