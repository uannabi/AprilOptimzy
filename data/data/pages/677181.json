Until that year, the church was the only Anglican temple dedicated to the Archangel Uriel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America","surface_form":"Episcopal church","offset":89},{"uri":"Sea_Girt","surface_form":"Sea Girt","offset":117},{"uri":"Monmouth_County%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Monmouth","offset":127},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":137},{"uri":"Anglicanism","surface_form":"Anglicanism","offset":211},{"uri":"Anglo-Catholicism","surface_form":"Anglo-Catholicism","offset":247},{"uri":"High_Church","surface_form":"High Church","offset":290},{"uri":"Uriel","surface_form":"Saint Uriel the Archangel","offset":365},{"uri":"Elmwood_Place%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Elmwood Place","offset":468},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":483},{"uri":"Chester%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Chester","offset":522},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":531},{"uri":"Society_of_the_Sisters_of_Bethany","surface_form":"Sisters of Bethany","offset":581}]}
