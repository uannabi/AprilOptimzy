{"id":67741,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cyberpunk is a kind of Science Fiction. The Cyberpunk genre began in the early 1980s. Bruce Bethke made this word for his 1980 short story \"Cyberpunk\" by putting together two words: \"cybernetics\" and \"punk rock\".\nSoon, people used this word to describe William Gibson's book, \"Neuromancer\".\nCyberpunk authors put their stories in different settings. The time is usually set in the near-future and the settings are often dystopian (characterized by misery). These are often societies with very advanced technology. Often, only a few huge corporations control the society. These corporations control the technology. Instead of being beneficial to all, technology is used by the few corporations for their own interests only. Many cyberpunk novels are about individual computer users. One hero fights a computer/Internet controlled society. These stories are often in the near future.\nThemes.\nCommon themes in cyberpunk include advances in information technology and especially the Internet, artificial intelligence and prosthetics and post-democratic societal control where corporations have more influence than governments. Nihilism, post-modernism, and film noir techniques are common elements, and the protagonists may be disaffected or reluctant anti-heroes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_Fiction","surface_form":"Science Fiction","offset":36},{"uri":"Bruce_Bethke","surface_form":"Bruce Bethke","offset":99},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short story","offset":140},{"uri":"Cybernetics","surface_form":"cybernetics","offset":196},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":214},{"uri":"Neuromancer","surface_form":"Neuromancer","offset":290},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":314},{"uri":"Dystopia","surface_form":"dystopia","offset":433},{"uri":"Corporation","surface_form":"corporation","offset":550},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":799},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":813},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":822},{"uri":"Information_technology","surface_form":"information technology","offset":950},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":992},{"uri":"Artificial_intelligence","surface_form":"artificial intelligence","offset":1002},{"uri":"Prosthetics","surface_form":"prosthetics","offset":1030},{"uri":"Nihilism","surface_form":"Nihilism","offset":1136},{"uri":"Post-modernism","surface_form":"post-modernism","offset":1146},{"uri":"Film_noir","surface_form":"film noir","offset":1166},{"uri":"Anti-hero","surface_form":"anti-hero","offset":1261}]}
