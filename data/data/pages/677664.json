After two or three days, I felt sad and stupid because I understood the limit imposed if these works were kept private. They would be like a discussion that was kept secret. Therefore I felt a responsibility to make this collection accessible to the widest possible public - \"The Private Museum of the Future\", Cristina Bechtler interview with Philippe M\u00E9aille, 2016.\nCh\u00E2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art.\nCh\u00E2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of contemporary art project began in November 2014. In June 2015, Philippe M\u00E9aille and Christian Gillet created a surprise in France, jointly announcing the signing of a long-term lease (between the Maine-et-Loire department and Philippe M\u00E9aille) on the Chateau de Montsoreau property. The Ch\u00E2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art becoming the first Ch\u00E2teau of the Loire Valley to be transformed into a museum of contemporary art. Despite the desire of both parties to create an international museum of contemporary art, and the ability from M\u00E9aille to endowing it with the world's largest collection of works by the radical conceptualists of Art & Language, and to seize the opportunity to develop the international tourist audience of the Loire Valley, the announcement created controversy. Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric B\u00E9atse, former Mayor of Angers, and socialist political leader, protests against what he calls \u00AB a sale of a jewel of the department to a private foreign player \u00BB. G\u00E9rard Persin (mayor of Montsoreau), and Christian Gillet both reacted very quickly to these protests during a press conference. G\u00E9rard Persin stated: \u00AB It is a pride to have been chosen to host a center of contemporary art of international stature \u00BB. Christian Gillet put the project in its international ambition and potential development for the territory: \u00AB The idea of Philippe M\u00E9aille, connoisseur and lover of the site, is to install a center of contemporary art featuring his collection, already world famous and renowned, we have considered an interesting challenge \u00BB. And Philippe M\u00E9aille clarified his intentions: \u00AB This public-private partnership appeared to us as an innovative solution that will be integrated into the Saumur territory in its entirety: Saumur and its agglomeration but also the nearby Fontevraud Abbey \u00BB.\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Barcelona.\nFor reasons of security due to political instability in Catalonia, Philippe M\u00E9aille announced that he decided to repatriate his collection in France to the Chateau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art. MACBA deplored the decision of Philippe M\u00E9aille not to renew his long-term agreement with the institution, and assured that the security of the collection is guaranteed, and that \"Philippe M\u00E9aille arguments do not coincide at all with reality\". Voices emerged to denounce a pretext on the part of the collector, to repatriate the works of Art & Language in his museum, opened only one year before.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":50},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Montsoreau-Museum_of_Contemporary_Art","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art","offset":113},{"uri":"Art_%26amp%3B_Language","surface_form":"Art & Language","offset":219},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Montsoreau-Museum_of_Contemporary_Art","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of contemporary art","offset":799},{"uri":"Christian_Gillet","surface_form":"Christian Gillet","offset":915},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":954},{"uri":"Chateau_de_Montsoreau","surface_form":"Chateau de Montsoreau","offset":1082},{"uri":"Contemporary_art","surface_form":"contemporary art","offset":1339},{"uri":"Art_%26amp%3B_Language","surface_form":"Art & Language","offset":1479},{"uri":"Loire_Valley","surface_form":"Loire Valley","offset":1577},{"uri":"Angers","surface_form":"Angers","offset":1662},{"uri":"Socialist_Party_(France)","surface_form":"socialist","offset":1674},{"uri":"Montsoreau","surface_form":"Montsoreau","offset":1826},{"uri":"Catalonia","surface_form":"Catalonia","offset":2732},{"uri":"Art_%26amp%3B_Language","surface_form":"Art & Language","offset":3221}]}
