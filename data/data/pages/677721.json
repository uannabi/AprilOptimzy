It is similar to the coats of arms and emblems of other Arab states.\nIt consists of a golden falcon, unlike other Arab countries which use the hawk emblem of the Quraysh branch to which Muhammad belonged. The falcon has a red disk which shows an Arab sailboat in its interior. The disk is surrounded by a chain. The hawk holds with its claws a red parchment bearing the inscription of the name of the federation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Arab_Emirates","surface_form":"United Arab Emirates","offset":18},{"uri":"Gold_(color)","surface_form":"golden","offset":187},{"uri":"Falcon","surface_form":"falcon","offset":194},{"uri":"Hawk","surface_form":"hawk","offset":244},{"uri":"Quraysh","surface_form":"Quraysh","offset":263},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":287},{"uri":"Dhow","surface_form":"Arab sailboat","offset":347}]}
