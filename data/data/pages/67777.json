It began in the Bronze Age between 3000 and 2700 BC. It lasted until about 1450 BC. The Minoan civilization is famous for its sea trading and well-planned cities. The Minoans had an agricultural system which relied mainly on olives and grapes. Their religion worshipped mostly goddesses. The Minoan civilization was later replaced by the Mycenaean culture.\nMinoan Architecture.\nCretans built palaces during their architecture era. In a non-royal palace there were many small rooms with cooler places to sit, because Crete got very hot in the summer. Palaces were used for many things. They were used as government centers, storerooms, stores, and administrative offices. Most palaces were very big. The Cretans might have gotten the money to create these palaces from working for the Egyptians. The royal palace was very different. Everyone had toilets, baths, and running water. The ones for the king and queen were very fancy. Their palace was fancy also. The architecture era was ended by a great fire. This era went from 2000 B.C. to 1450 B.C.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crete","surface_form":"Crete","offset":46},{"uri":"Minos","surface_form":"Minos","offset":65},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":88},{"uri":"Trading","surface_form":"trading","offset":202},{"uri":"Agricultural","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":254},{"uri":"Olive_(fruit)","surface_form":"olives","offset":297},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":308},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":349},{"uri":"Mycenaean_culture","surface_form":"Mycenaean culture","offset":410}]}
