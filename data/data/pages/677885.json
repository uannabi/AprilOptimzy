{"id":677885,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab_of_Bengal","text":"The Nawabs of Bengal (the Nawab Nizam of Bengal and Orissa) were the rulers of the provinces of Bengal and Orissa. Between 1717 and 1772, they were the rulers of the province of Bengal.\nThe last independent Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar. He lost to the British, who in 1757, installed Mir Jafar on the throne and established itself as a political power in Bengal.\nIn 1765 the system of 'dual government' meant the Nawabs ruled on behalf of the British, and were puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal was brought under direct control of the British. In 1793, when the \"Nizamat\" (governorship) of the Nawab was also taken away from them, they remained as the pensioners of the British East India Company. The last Nawab of Bengal, Mansur Ali Khan abdicated on 1 November 1880 in favour of his eldest son, Hassan Ali Mirza.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bengal","surface_form":"Bengal","offset":96},{"uri":"Orissa%2C_India","surface_form":"Orissa","offset":107},{"uri":"Bengal","surface_form":"Bengal","offset":178},{"uri":"Siraj_ud-Daulah","surface_form":"Siraj ud-Daulah","offset":224},{"uri":"Battle_of_Plassey","surface_form":"Battle of Plassey","offset":261},{"uri":"Mir_Jafar","surface_form":"Mir Jafar","offset":282},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British","offset":308},{"uri":"Princely_state","surface_form":"ruled on behalf","offset":476},{"uri":"British_East_India_Company","surface_form":"British East India Company","offset":760},{"uri":"Mansur_Ali_Khan","surface_form":"Mansur Ali Khan","offset":814},{"uri":"Hassan_Ali_Mirza","surface_form":"Hassan Ali Mirza","offset":888}]}
