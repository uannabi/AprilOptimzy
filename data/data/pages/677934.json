The type specimen of Ingentia, PVSJ 1086, was discovered in the Quebrada del Barro Formation of northwestern Argentina. The only species, \"Ingentia prima\", meaning \"first huge one\", as the taxon was one of the first very large sauropodomorphs to evolve, along with its close relative Lessemsaurus. A second specimen, PVSJ 1087, was referred, containing five tail vertebrae, both the radius and ulna, a left calfbone and a right foot.\n\"Ledumahadi\".\n\"Ledumahadi\" (meaning \"a giant thunderclap\" in Sesotho language) is a sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic. A quadruped, it was one of the first giant sauropodomorphs, reaching a weight of around, despite not having evolved columnar limbs like its later huge relatives.\n\"Lessemsaurus\".\n\"Lessemsaurus\" is an extinct genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Triassic period. It is unusual because it lived about 30 million years before the long-necked plant-eaters \"Diplodocus\" and \"Brachiosaurus\" lived.\nThe type species, \"L. sauropoides\", was formally described by Jos\u00E9 Bonaparte in 1999. It was found in the Los Colorados Formation of La Rioja Province, Argentina.\nThis dinosaur was around long and was discovered in strata dating to the Norian stage, around 210 million years ago.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":20},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":35},{"uri":"Dinosaurs","surface_form":"dinosaurs","offset":44},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":72},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":85},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":97},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":111},{"uri":"Nematode","surface_form":"nematode","offset":223},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":702},{"uri":"Ulna","surface_form":"ulna","offset":713},{"uri":"Sesotho_language","surface_form":"Sesotho language","offset":814},{"uri":"Sauropodomorph","surface_form":"sauropodomorph","offset":837},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":852},{"uri":"Early_Jurassic","surface_form":"Early Jurassic","offset":870},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":1085},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":1093},{"uri":"Sauropod","surface_form":"sauropod","offset":1102},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":1111},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":1129},{"uri":"Diplodocus","surface_form":"Diplodocus","offset":1237},{"uri":"Brachiosaurus","surface_form":"Brachiosaurus","offset":1254},{"uri":"Type_species","surface_form":"type species","offset":1280},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Bonaparte","offset":1338},{"uri":"Los_Colorados_Formation","surface_form":"Los Colorados Formation","offset":1382},{"uri":"La_Rioja_Province%2C_Argentina","surface_form":"La Rioja Province, Argentina","offset":1409},{"uri":"Norian","surface_form":"Norian","offset":1512},{"uri":"Faunal_stage","surface_form":"stage","offset":1519}]}
