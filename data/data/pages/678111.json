He discovered that the replacement of the salts that are in the secreted plasma is the key to a successful and simplified treatment.\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, Dr. Rosenthal and colleagues undertook a long-term study to test the efficacy of drinking a saline solution (containing table salt and baking soda) to replace the lost salts (the \"Peru Project\").\nHis research group demonstrated that this therapy was an effective alternative to the traditional treatment using intravenous injections of whole blood or plasma.\nThe simplified burn therapy remains widely used.\nHistamines.\nDr. Rosenthal and his collaborators were pioneers in the area of histamine biochemistry and physiology.\nThey developed a widely used method for quantifying histamine, worked on the pharmacology of histamines, and determined the biosynthetic pathway for spermidine.\nDr. Rosenthal also collaborated in research on the role of polyamines in the function of viral DNA.\nAwards and honors.\nDr. Rosenthal was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.\nHe was also a member of American Medical Association, American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Society of American Bacteriologists, and Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.\nIn 1962, he received the Public Health Service Meritorious Service Medal from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\nIn 1973, he received the Harvey Stuart Allen Distinguished Service Award from the American Burn Association.\nIn 1980, he received the Award for Experimental Therapeutics from the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in recognition of his pioneering work on the treatment of shock due to burns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Albany%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Albany, Georgia","offset":88},{"uri":"Vanderbilt_University","surface_form":"Vanderbilt University","offset":137},{"uri":"Boston_City_Hospital","surface_form":"Boston City Hospital","offset":212},{"uri":"Johns_Hopkins_University","surface_form":"Johns Hopkins University","offset":379},{"uri":"McGill_University","surface_form":"McGill University","offset":464},{"uri":"Montreal%2C_Canada","surface_form":"Montreal, Canada","offset":485},{"uri":"United_States_Public_Health_Service","surface_form":"United States Public Health Service (USPHS)","offset":550},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":597},{"uri":"National_Institute_of_Arthritis_and_Musculoskeletal_and_Skin_Diseases","surface_form":"National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases (NIAMD)","offset":694},{"uri":"United_States_Public_Health_Service_Commissioned_Corps","surface_form":"USPHS Commissioned Officer Corps","offset":843},{"uri":"NIAMD","surface_form":"NIAMD","offset":939},{"uri":"Liver_function_tests","surface_form":"liver function tests","offset":1288},{"uri":"Bromsulphthalein","surface_form":"bromsulphthalein","offset":1332},{"uri":"Sulfonamide_(medicine)","surface_form":"sulfa drugs","offset":1859},{"uri":"Sulfanilamide","surface_form":"sulfanilamide","offset":1976},{"uri":"Oral_rehydration_therapy","surface_form":"drinking a saline solution","offset":2442},{"uri":"Histamine","surface_form":"histamine","offset":2846},{"uri":"Spermidine","surface_form":"spermidine","offset":3034},{"uri":"American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","surface_form":"American Academy of Arts and Sciences","offset":3198},{"uri":"American_Medical_Association","surface_form":"American Medical Association","offset":3269},{"uri":"American_Society_for_Pharmacology_and_Experimental_Therapeutics","surface_form":"American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","offset":3299},{"uri":"Society_of_American_Bacteriologists","surface_form":"Society of American Bacteriologists","offset":3364},{"uri":"Society_for_Experimental_Biology_and_Medicine","surface_form":"Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine","offset":3405},{"uri":"Public_Health_Service_Meritorious_Service_Medal","surface_form":"Public Health Service Meritorious Service Medal","offset":3477},{"uri":"U.S._Department_of_Health%2C_Education%2C_and_Welfare","surface_form":"U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare","offset":3534},{"uri":"American_Burn_Association","surface_form":"American Burn Association","offset":3667},{"uri":"American_Society_for_Pharmacology_and_Experimental_Therapeutics","surface_form":"American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","offset":3764}]}
