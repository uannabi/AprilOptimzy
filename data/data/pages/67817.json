He went to school in Westminster School and studied at Christ Church, Oxford. He then went to the Leipzig Conservatory where he learnt to conduct by watching the great Hungarian conductor Arthur Nikisch. He sang in choral festivals and at the Leeds Festival of 1913, where he went to watch Nikisch conduct.\nDuring World War I he worked for the War Office, and while he was there in 1918 he planned a series of concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra, which included several important new British works including Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\", \"A London Symphony\" by Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Elgar's \"Symphony No. 2\". When Boult was a boy he had already met Elgar. Elgar now wrote to him and said he felt sure the future of his music was safe in Boult's hands. Boult was at the start of a great career in which he conducted a lot of 20th century British music.\nBirmingham and the BBC.\nIn 1924 Boult became conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra\u2014now the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra \u2014 and in 1930 he was made Director of Music at the BBC. When the BBC formed the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Boult also became its chief conductor, combining both jobs.\nBoult became famous for conducting a wide repertoire, including the very modern-sounding music of Arnold Schoenberg. In 1933 he married Ann Wilson, the ex-wife of the singer and administrator Steuart Wilson. The marriage lasted until Boult's death. Boult was knighted in 1937.\nWar years and after.\nDuring World War II the BBC Symphony Orchestra was evacuated to Bristol. Even there it was not safe from the bombing and they moved again to Bedford.\nAfter the war the BBC started the BBC Third Programme and Boult was involved in many new plans for concerts and recordings.\nIn 1948, Steuart Wilson became Director of Music at the BBC. Some people were saying that the music on the BBC was not so good and that Boult ought to retire when he became 60 in 1949. He then became conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra with whom he made many recordings.\nLater years.\nBoult continued to conduct until he was very old. His many recordings, including music he had heard Nikisch conduct many years before.

He also gave talks on the radio. He spoke in a very polite, formal style.\nHis conducting.\nBoult always conducted with a baton (conductor\u2019s stick). His conducting was very graceful, his movements were very simple and clear.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Knight_Bachelor","surface_form":"Sir","offset":0},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":68},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":76},{"uri":"Chester","surface_form":"Chester","offset":118},{"uri":"Westminster_School","surface_form":"Westminster School","offset":148},{"uri":"Christ_Church%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Christ Church","offset":182},{"uri":"University_of_Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":197},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":225},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":295},{"uri":"Arthur_Nikisch","surface_form":"Arthur Nikisch","offset":315},{"uri":"Leeds_Festival","surface_form":"Leeds Festival","offset":370},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":441},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":509},{"uri":"London_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"London Symphony Orchestra","offset":555},{"uri":"Gustav_Holst","surface_form":"Gustav Holst","offset":643},{"uri":"The_Planets","surface_form":"The Planets","offset":659},{"uri":"Ralph_Vaughan_Williams","surface_form":"Ralph Vaughan Williams","offset":696},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":927},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":965},{"uri":"City_of_Birmingham_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra","offset":1092},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":1181},{"uri":"BBC_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"BBC Symphony Orchestra","offset":1210},{"uri":"Arnold_Schoenberg","surface_form":"Arnold Schoenberg","offset":1392},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1599},{"uri":"BBC_Symphony_Orchestra","surface_form":"BBC Symphony Orchestra","offset":1616},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":1656},{"uri":"Bedford%2C_England","surface_form":"Bedford","offset":1733},{"uri":"1949","surface_form":"1949","offset":2045},{"uri":"London_Philharmonic_Orchestra","surface_form":"London Philharmonic Orchestra","offset":2083},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":2347},{"uri":"The_Sanguine_Fan","surface_form":"The Sanguine Fan","offset":2355},{"uri":"London_Festival_Ballet","surface_form":"London Festival Ballet","offset":2377},{"uri":"Coliseum_Theatre","surface_form":"Coliseum","offset":2407},{"uri":"Companion_of_Honour","surface_form":"Companion of Honour","offset":2461},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiography","offset":2631},{"uri":"Boast","surface_form":"boast","offset":2718},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":2766},{"uri":"Polite","surface_form":"polite","offset":2792},{"uri":"Formal","surface_form":"formal","offset":2800},{"uri":"Baton","surface_form":"baton","offset":2860}]}
