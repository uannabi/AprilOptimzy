{"id":67820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Leh%C3%A1r","text":"e=\"preserve\">Franz Leh\u00E1r (born 30 April 1870; died 24 October 1948) was an Austrian composer of Hungarian descent. He was the leading composer of operettas in the 20th century. He is still one of the most popular composers of light music.\nHis life.\nLeh\u00E1r was born in Kom\u00E1ron in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today the town is called Kom\u00E1rno and it is in Slovakia. He was the eldest son of a bandmaster in the Austro-Hungarian army. He studied violin and composition at the Prague Conservatory. Anton\u00EDn Dvo\u0159\u00E1k told him he should be a composer. After graduation in 1899 he joined his father's band in Vienna, as assistant bandmaster. In 1902 he became conductor at the historic Vienna Theater an der Wien, where his first opera \"Wiener Frauen\" was performed in November of that year.\nHe is most famous for his operettas. The best known one is \"The Merry Widow\" (in German: \"Die lustige Witwe\") which is probably the most popular of all operettas. He also wrote sonatas, symphonic poems, marches, and a number of waltzes, some of which come from his famous operettas. Some of the songs from his operettas have become very well-known, especially \"Vilja\" from \"The Merry Widow\" and \"You Are My Heart's Delight\" (\"Dein ist mein ganzes Herz\") from \"The Land of Smiles\".\nThe tenor Richard Tauber sang in many of his operettas. Six of them had parts especially written for him.\nLeh\u00E1r died in 1948 in Bad Ischl, near Salzburg where he was also buried.
