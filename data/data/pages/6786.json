{"id":6786,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language","text":"Icelandic is the language spoken by the people of Iceland.\nIt is a Germanic language. It comes from the Old Norse language, the language spoken by the Vikings. Because Iceland is far away from other countries, the language has not changed much. Icelandic people can still read words from hundreds of years ago.\nIcelandic uses four characters that are not used in English: \u00FE (thorn), (like 'th' in thin), \u00F0 (edh), (like 'th' in this), \u00E6 (pronounced like I) and \u00F6 (pronounced like the French U). It can also be said that \u00F0 is a \"softer\" version of \u00FE.\nSome linguists say there are only two Nordic languages, Eastern-Nordic and Western-Nordic, which includes Icelandic and Faroese because of their similarity.\nIcelandic is also one of the most difficult languages to learn.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":17},{"uri":"Iceland","surface_form":"Iceland","offset":50},{"uri":"Germanic_languages","surface_form":"Germanic language","offset":67},{"uri":"Old_Norse_language","surface_form":"Old Norse language","offset":104},{"uri":"Viking","surface_form":"Viking","offset":151},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"character","offset":331},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":363},{"uri":"%C3%BE","surface_form":"\u00FE","offset":372},{"uri":"%C3%B0","surface_form":"\u00F0","offset":404},{"uri":"%C3%A6","surface_form":"\u00E6","offset":434},{"uri":"%C3%B6","surface_form":"\u00F6","offset":460}]}
