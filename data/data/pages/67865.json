{"id":67865,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesocyclone","text":"A mesocyclone is a vortex of air, about 2\u00A0to\u00A010\u00A0km in diameter (the mesoscale of meteorology), inside a convective storm.\nThat is, it is air that rises and rotates around a vertical axis, usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, related with a localized low pressure area inside a severe thunderstorm. Such storms can create strong surface winds and a lot of hail. Mesocyclones often happen together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form.\nMesocyclones are normally relatively very small in size; they lie between the synoptic scale (hundreds of kilometers) and small scale (hundreds of meters).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vortex","surface_form":"vortex","offset":19},{"uri":"Convection","surface_form":"convective","offset":104},{"uri":"Storm","surface_form":"storm","offset":115},{"uri":"Low_pressure_area","surface_form":"low pressure area","offset":329},{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"severe thunderstorm","offset":356},{"uri":"Hail","surface_form":"hail","offset":434},{"uri":"Supercell","surface_form":"supercell","offset":492},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":510}]}
