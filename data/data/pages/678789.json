He made the announcement on Vermont Public Radio. This is his second run for the Democratic nomination, following his campaign in the 2016 primaries. He also announced his campaign in an email to his supporters on the same day.\nHe entered into the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries as one of the front-runner candidates, as compared to his prior 2016 underdog campaign. His 2020 race has more advantages as his policy ideas accepted into the Democratic mainstream.\nIn a crowded field of primary candidates, Sanders both leads in polling and has the largest fan base than his competition. Policies from his last campaign, such as single-payer healthcare and tuition-free public colleges, had since entered mainstream Democratic thought.\nIn October 2019, the Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign gained the support of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\nOn April 8, 2020 one day after the Wisconsin primary, Sanders ended his campaign after failing to beat Biden in many primary contests after Super Tuesday. On April 13, Sanders formally endorsed Biden for the Democratic nomination.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":0},{"uri":"Vermont_Public_Radio","surface_form":"Vermont Public Radio","offset":130},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders_2016_presidential_campaign","surface_form":"his campaign","offset":216},{"uri":"2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries","surface_form":"2016 primaries","offset":236},{"uri":"2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries","surface_form":"2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries","offset":350},{"uri":"Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez","surface_form":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","offset":921},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":982}]}
