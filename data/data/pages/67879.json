{"id":67879,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester","text":"A jester, joker, fool, or buffoon, is a type of entertainer mostly (but not always) associated with the Middle Ages. Jesters typically wore brightly colored clothing. Their hats, sometimes called the \"cap \u2019n bells\" or \"cockscomb\", were special; made of cloth, they were floppy with three points (liliripes) each of which had a jingle bell at the end.\nThe three points of the hat represent the asses' ears and tail worn by jesters when they first appeared. Other typical things about the jester were his constant laughter and his mock scepter, known as a \"bauble\" or \"maharoof.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainer","offset":48},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":104},{"uri":"Jingle_bell","surface_form":"jingle bell","offset":327},{"uri":"Donkey","surface_form":"asses","offset":393},{"uri":"Laughter","surface_form":"laughter","offset":512},{"uri":"Mock","surface_form":"mock","offset":529},{"uri":"Scepter","surface_form":"scepter","offset":534}]}
