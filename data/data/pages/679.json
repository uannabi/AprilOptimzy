It is used in American and Canadian English.\nA ranch may be on private or public land. The desert areas of the western United States have many ranches, because there is much land that is not very good for crop<nowiki/>s. There are also many in desert areas of Australia, where they are called stations. Someone who takes care of the livestock may be called a stockman or cowboy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":19},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":36},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":42},{"uri":"Sheep","surface_form":"sheep","offset":50},{"uri":"Livestock","surface_form":"livestock","offset":65},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":105},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American","offset":142},{"uri":"Canadian_English","surface_form":"Canadian English","offset":155},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":209},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":219},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":247},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":333},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":388},{"uri":"Station_(agriculture)","surface_form":"stations","offset":421},{"uri":"Stockman","surface_form":"stockman","offset":487},{"uri":"Cowboy","surface_form":"cowboy","offset":499}]}
