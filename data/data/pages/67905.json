It is like making an educated, reasonable guess based on the information given.\nIf an estimate is more than the actual amount, then it is called an overestimate. If the estimate was less than the actual result, then it is called an underestimate. This is different from a prediction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Approximation","surface_form":"approximation","offset":18},{"uri":"Prediction","surface_form":"prediction","offset":404}]}
