{"id":679188,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy","text":"=\"preserve\">The Chomsky hierarchy is a concept of theoretical computer science. Noam Chomsky looked at grammars of regular language and classified them into four levels, numbered 0 to 3.\nGroup 0 consists of regular expressions without restriction, while groups 1 to 3 contain restrictions. Grammars in higher-numbered levels also satisfy the constraints of all levels below them. The concept was developed in the 1950s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Noam_Chomsky","surface_form":"Noam Chomsky","offset":80}]}
