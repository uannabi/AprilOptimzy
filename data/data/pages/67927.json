{"id":67927,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wit","text":"Wit is a form of intellectual humour. A wit is someone skilled in making witty remarks. A witty remark is a smart observation, put with humor and said in the perfect moment. Forms of wit include: the quip and the repartee.\nWitty remarks may be intentionally cruel, and perhaps more ingenious than funny.\nA quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of point; a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer.
