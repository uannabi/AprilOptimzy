{"id":67960,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation","text":"e=\"preserve\">Nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen in the air (N2) is changed (converted) into ammonia () or other nitrogenous compounds in the soil.\nNitrogen fixation is essential to life because nitrogen compounds are needed for making all nitrogen-containing organic compounds, such as amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids.\nAtmospheric nitrogen is a relatively unreactive molecule. It is useless to all except a few bacteria and archaea. Biological nitrogen fixation converts into ammonia, which is used (metabolized) by most organisms.\nMicroorganisms that fix nitrogen (diazotrophs).\nCyanobacteria are in most environments on Earth. They play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere. Cyanobacteria use many sources of combined nitrogen, like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino acids.\nSeveral cyanobacteria are also diazotrophs which can fix nitrogen from the air. This is an ability which may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archaean.\nCyanobacteria in coral reefs can fix twice the amount of nitrogen than on land\u2014around 1.8\u00A0kg of nitrogen is fixed per hectare per day. The colonial marine cyanobacterium \"Trichodesmium\" may fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen-fixation in marine systems on a global scale.\nLegume family.\nPlants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family\u00A0\u2013 Fabaceae\u00A0\u2013 with taxa such as kudzu, clovers, soybeans, alfalfa, lupines, peanuts, and rooibos. They have symbiotic bacteria called \"Rhizobia\" in nodules in their root systems, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed\nnitrogen is released, making it available to other plants and this helps to fertilize the soil. Most legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., \"Styphnolobium\") do not. In traditional farming practice, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually includes one consisting mainly or entirely of clover or buckwheat (non-legume family \"Polygonaceae\"), which are often referred to as \"green manure\".\nNon-leguminous.\nAll these families belong to the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales, which together with the Fabales form a clade. In this clade, Fabales were the first lineage to branch off; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen was lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant.\nBiological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Hermann Hellnegel (18311895) and Martinus Beijerinck (18511931).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":55},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":157},{"uri":"Organic_compounds","surface_form":"organic compounds","offset":275},{"uri":"Amino_acids","surface_form":"amino acids","offset":302},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":315},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":329},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":436},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"archaea","offset":449},{"uri":"Ammonia","surface_form":"ammonia","offset":501},{"uri":"Cyanobacteria","surface_form":"Cyanobacteria","offset":605},{"uri":"Nitrogen_cycle","surface_form":"nitrogen cycle","offset":692},{"uri":"Biosphere","surface_form":"biosphere","offset":714},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":783},{"uri":"Nitrite","surface_form":"nitrite","offset":792},{"uri":"Ammonium","surface_form":"ammonium","offset":801},{"uri":"Urea","surface_form":"urea","offset":811},{"uri":"Amino_acids","surface_form":"amino acids","offset":825},{"uri":"Archaea","surface_form":"Archaea","offset":1002},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":1029},{"uri":"Legume","surface_form":"legume","offset":1397},{"uri":"Fabaceae","surface_form":"Fabaceae","offset":1413},{"uri":"Kudzu","surface_form":"kudzu","offset":1442},{"uri":"Clover","surface_form":"clover","offset":1449},{"uri":"Soybean","surface_form":"soybean","offset":1458},{"uri":"Alfalfa","surface_form":"alfalfa","offset":1468},{"uri":"Lupin","surface_form":"lupin","offset":1477},{"uri":"Peanut","surface_form":"peanut","offset":1486},{"uri":"Rooibos","surface_form":"rooibos","offset":1499},{"uri":"Symbiosis","surface_form":"symbiotic","offset":1518},{"uri":"Rhizobia","surface_form":"Rhizobia","offset":1545},{"uri":"Root_nodule","surface_form":"nodules","offset":1558},{"uri":"Root","surface_form":"root systems","offset":1575},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":1798},{"uri":"Styphnolobium","surface_form":"Styphnolobium","offset":1865},{"uri":"Polygonaceae","surface_form":"Polygonaceae","offset":2073},{"uri":"Green_manure","surface_form":"green manure","offset":2121},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":2185},{"uri":"Cucurbitales","surface_form":"Cucurbitales","offset":2192},{"uri":"Fagales","surface_form":"Fagales","offset":2206},{"uri":"Rosales","surface_form":"Rosales","offset":2219},{"uri":"Fabales","surface_form":"Fabales","offset":2252},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":2267},{"uri":"Hermann_Hellnegel","surface_form":"Hermann Hellnegel","offset":2484},{"uri":"Martinus_Beijerinck","surface_form":"Martinus Beijerinck","offset":2517}]}
