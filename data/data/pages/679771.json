{"id":679771,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_cattle","text":"The Highland cattle (;) is a Scottish cattle breed. They have long horns and long, wavy, woolly coats. The long oily outer hair covers a downy undercoat. This makes them well suited to conditions in the Highlands, which have a high annual rainfall and sometimes very strong winds.\nHighlands are raised primarily for their meat. They originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Outer Hebrides. They were first mentioned in the 6th century AD. They have since been exported worldwide.\nThey are a hardy breed. Their long hair gives them the ability to overwinter in the valleys. Bulls can weigh up to 800\u00A0kilograms (1,800\u00A0pounds) and cows can up to 500\u00A0kilograms (1,100\u00A0pounds). Their milk generally has a high butterfat content. Their meat, which is of the highest quality, is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":29},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":38},{"uri":"Horn_(anatomy)","surface_form":"horns","offset":67},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"woolly","offset":89},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"meat","offset":322},{"uri":"Scottish_Highlands","surface_form":"Scottish Highlands","offset":351},{"uri":"Outer_Hebrides","surface_form":"Outer Hebrides","offset":378},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":439},{"uri":"Butterfat","surface_form":"butterfat","offset":709},{"uri":"Cholesterol","surface_form":"cholesterol","offset":785}]}
