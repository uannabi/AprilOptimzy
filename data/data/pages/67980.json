Along with the university administration, four of the main faculties - Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Geology, the Faculty of Geography, and the Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts - now are in the Main building. The star on the top of the tower is large enough so that it has a small room and a viewing platform; it weighs 12 tons.

It stands before a terrace featuring statues of male and female students gazing optimistically and confidently into the future.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":67},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":81},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":119},{"uri":"Ivan_Shuvalov","surface_form":"Ivan Shuvalov","offset":142},{"uri":"Mikhail_Lomonosov","surface_form":"Mikhail Lomonosov","offset":160},{"uri":"Stalinist_architecture","surface_form":"Stalinist architecture","offset":283},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":434},{"uri":"Lev_Rudnev","surface_form":"Lev Vladimirovich Rudnev","offset":444},{"uri":"Stalin_Prize","surface_form":"Stalin Prize","offset":517},{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":590},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":609},{"uri":"MSU_Faculty_of_Mechanics_and_Mathematics","surface_form":"Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics","offset":1234},{"uri":"MSU_Faculty_of_Geology","surface_form":"Faculty of Geology","offset":1276},{"uri":"MSU_Faculty_of_Geography","surface_form":"Faculty of Geography","offset":1300},{"uri":"MSU_Faculty_of_Fine_and_Performing_Arts","surface_form":"Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts","offset":1330}]}
