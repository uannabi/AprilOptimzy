{"id":680057,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek","text":"e=\"preserve\">Romanization of Greek is a way to write the Greek language (either Ancient or modern Greek) with the Roman alphabet. This can either be done by mapping letters (called transliteration) or by mapping sounds (called transcription. The greek name \u1F38\u03C9\u03AC\u03BD\u03BD\u03B7\u03C2 can be transliterated as Johannes, which became John, in Modern English. In modern Greek, it is generally written \u0393\u03B9\u03AC\u03BD\u03BD\u03B7\u03C2, which transliterates to Yannis. The masculine Greek word \u1F0D\u03B3\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2 or \u0386\u03B3\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2 might variously appear as Hagi\u03BFs, Agios, Aghios, or Ayios, or simply be translated as \"Holy\" or \"Saint\" in English forms of Greek placenames.\nTraditional English renderings of Greek names originated from Roman systems established in antiquity. The Roman alphabet itself was a form of the Cumaean alphabet which was developed from the Euboean script that valued as and as and used variant forms of and that became L and S. When this script was used to write the classical Greek alphabet, \u27E8\u03BA\u27E9 was replaced with \u27E8c\u27E9, \u27E8\u03B1\u03B9\u27E9 and \u27E8\u03BF\u03B9\u27E9 became \u27E8\u00E6\u27E9 and \u27E8\u0153\u27E9, and \u27E8\u03B5\u03B9\u27E9 and \u27E8\u03BF\u03C5\u27E9 were simplified to \u27E8i\u27E9 (more rarely\u2014corresponding to an earlier pronunciation\u2014\u27E8e\u27E9) and \u27E8u\u27E9. Aspirated consonants like \u27E8\u03B8\u27E9, \u27E8\u03C6\u27E9, initial-\u27E8\u03C1\u27E9, and \u27E8\u03C7\u27E9 simply wrote out the sound: \u27E8th\u27E9, \u27E8ph\u27E9, \u27E8rh\u27E9, and \u27E8ch\u27E9. Because English orthography has changed so much from the original Greek, modern scholarly transliteration now usually renders \u27E8\u03BA\u27E9 as \u27E8k\u27E9 and the diphthongs \u27E8\u03B1\u03B9, \u03BF\u03B9, \u03B5\u03B9, \u03BF\u03C5\u27E9 as \u27E8ai, oi, ei, ou\u27E9. Modern scholars also increasingly render \u27E8\u03C7\u27E9 as \u27E8kh\u27E9.The sounds of the Greek language changed: Modern Greek sounds different from Ancient Greek. This also has had an influence on the lessers used in English and other languages. This led to a number of different romanizations for names and placenames in the 19th and 20th century. The Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT) issued its system in cooperation with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1983. This system was adopted (with minor modifications) by the United Nations' Fifth Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names at Montreal in 1987, by the United Kingdom's Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) and by the United States' Board on Geographic Names (BGN) in 1996, and by the ISO itself in 1997. Romanization of names for official purposes (as with passports and identity cards) were required to use the ELOT system within Greece until 2011, when a legal decision permitted Greeks to use irregular forms (such as \"Demetrios\" for) provided that official identification and documents also list the standard forms (as, for example, \"Demetrios OR Dimitrios\"). Other romanization systems are the BGN/PCGN's earlier 1962 system and the system employed by the American Library Association and the United States' Library of Congress.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek language","offset":57},{"uri":"Roman_alphabet","surface_form":"Roman alphabet","offset":114},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":165},{"uri":"Transliteration","surface_form":"transliteration","offset":181},{"uri":"Transcription","surface_form":"transcription","offset":227},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":664},{"uri":"Roman_alphabet","surface_form":"Roman alphabet","offset":708},{"uri":"Cumaean_alphabet","surface_form":"Cumaean alphabet","offset":748},{"uri":"Euboean_alphabet","surface_form":"Euboean script","offset":794},{"uri":"L","surface_form":"L","offset":873},{"uri":"S","surface_form":"S","offset":879},{"uri":"Aspirated_consonant","surface_form":"Aspirated consonant","offset":1118},{"uri":"English_orthography","surface_form":"English orthography","offset":1239},{"uri":"Greek_orthography","surface_form":"Greek","offset":1297},{"uri":"Hellenic_Organization_for_Standardization","surface_form":"Hellenic Organization for Standardization","offset":1760},{"uri":"International_Organization_for_Standardization","surface_form":"International Organization for Standardization","offset":1851},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1971},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":2052},{"uri":"Permanent_Committee_on_Geographical_Names_for_British_Official_Use","surface_form":"Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use","offset":2094},{"uri":"United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names","surface_form":"Board on Geographic Names","offset":2194},{"uri":"Demetrios","surface_form":"Demetrios","offset":2484},{"uri":"American_Library_Association","surface_form":"American Library Association","offset":2723},{"uri":"Library_of_Congress","surface_form":"Library of Congress","offset":2775}]}
