Digital versions of the album show a pink background, while the physical album has a black background.\nThree singles were released from the album: \"thank u, next\", \"7 rings\", and \"break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored\". The first two entered at number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, Canadian Hot 100, and in several other countries. \"break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored\" entered at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 when \"7 rings\" was on top and \"thank u, next\" was at number three. This made Grande the first solo artist to occupy the top three of that chart in one week. In the UK, all three singles reached number one.\nThe album entered album charts at number one in several countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\nTrack listing.\nTracks from Apple Music.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":73},{"uri":"Ariana_Grande","surface_form":"Ariana Grande","offset":94},{"uri":"Sweetener_(album)","surface_form":"sweetener","offset":205},{"uri":"Thank_u%2C_next","surface_form":"thank u, next","offset":474},{"uri":"7_rings","surface_form":"7 rings","offset":491},{"uri":"Break_up_with_your_girlfriend%2C_i%27m_bored","surface_form":"break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored","offset":506},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":595},{"uri":"Canadian_Hot_100","surface_form":"Canadian Hot 100","offset":616},{"uri":"Apple_Music","surface_form":"Apple Music","offset":1103}]}
