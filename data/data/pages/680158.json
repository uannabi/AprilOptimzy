He is the president of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. He was appointed in 2007 after the death of his father.\nFalwell announced his endorsement for Donald Trump as Republican in the 2016 Presidential Election on January 26, 2016. That caused several Liberty University alumni and other Christians to become concerned that Falwell had \"sold his soul.\"\nIn an August 19, 2016 editorial in \"The Washington Post\", Falwell compared Trump to Winston Churchill. He said: \"We need a leader with qualities that resemble Winston Churchill. And I believe that leader is Donald Trump.\"\nIn August 2017, after the Unite the Right protests in which a counter-protester was killed, Falwell defended President Trump, saying that the President doesn't have \"a racist bone in his body\".\nFalwell was born in Lynchburg, Virginia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"attorney","offset":60},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":73},{"uri":"Liberty_University","surface_form":"Liberty University","offset":122},{"uri":"Lynchburg%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Lynchburg, Virginia","offset":144},{"uri":"Jerry_Falwell","surface_form":"his father","offset":209},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":259},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":397},{"uri":"The_Washington_Post","surface_form":"The Washington Post","offset":498},{"uri":"Winston_Churchill","surface_form":"Winston Churchill","offset":546},{"uri":"2017_Unite_the_Right_rally","surface_form":"Unite the Right protests","offset":710},{"uri":"Lynchburg%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Lynchburg, Virginia","offset":898}]}
