{"id":680347,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal","text":"The Green New Deal (GND) is the name of many proposed economic programs in the United States that would focus on economic inequality and climate change. It is named after Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program from between 1933 and 1936.\nU.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey released a 14-page document about the GND on 7 February 2019. They want to push the United States to using 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources. Their plan would also address poverty in the U.S., and implement universal health care. The American Action Network estimated the plan would cost at least $1 trillion, and the document did not show where the money would specifically come from.\nSupport.\nJill Stein talked about the GND as early as 2012. The GND is officially in the Green Party USA's platform.\nOrganisations like 350.org, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth support the GND proposal.\nThe GND is also supported by Democratic politicians Deb Haaland, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Antonio Delgado, John Lewis, Earl Blumenauer, Carolyn Maloney, and Jos\u00E9 Serrano.\nCriticism.\nU.S. President Donald Trump is against the idea of a Green New Deal. He said on Twitter: \"I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called \u201CCarbon Footprint\u201D to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economic program","offset":54},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":79},{"uri":"Economic_inequality","surface_form":"economic inequality","offset":113},{"uri":"Climate_change","surface_form":"climate change","offset":137},{"uri":"Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
