Lotus flowers are large \u2013 up to 20\u00A0cm (8 inches) across \u2013 and they smell sweet.\nThe Sacred lotus of Asia has pink flowers. The American lotus has yellow flowers.\nIn India the lotus is considered a symbol of purity\nThe lotus flowers grow over the water. Lotus leaves often float on top of the water. The roots of lotus plants are in the mud (wet dirt) under the water. Every part of every plant must have air for respiration (breathing). Air spaces in the stems and roots make the lotus able to live and respire under water.\nPeople can eat lotus roots and seeds. Cattle (cows) like to eat the leaves and flowers.\nLotuses look rather like water lilies from the Nymphaeaceae family. It is the \"National flower\" of both India and Vietnam and also the \"Provincial flower\" of Sindh province, Pakistan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":15},{"uri":"Water_plant","surface_form":"water plant","offset":24},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":233},{"uri":"Mud","surface_form":"mud","offset":404},{"uri":"Respiration","surface_form":"respiration","offset":480},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"Cattle","offset":630},{"uri":"Nymphaeaceae","surface_form":"Nymphaeaceae","offset":727},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":784},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":794},{"uri":"Sindh","surface_form":"Sindh","offset":838}]}
