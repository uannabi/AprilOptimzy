The family is also called \"water-lily family\".\nTheir flowers suggest they are one of the earliest groups of angiosperms. Modern genetic analyses by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group researchers has confirmed its basal position among flowering plants.\nAlso, the Nymphaeaceae are more diverse and wdespread than other basal angiosperms. Nymphaeaceae is in the order Nymphaeales. According to the most widely accepted flowering plant classification system, this is the second diverging group of angiosperms after \"Amborella\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":3},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":51},{"uri":"Angiosperms","surface_form":"angiosperms","offset":187},{"uri":"Sequence_analysis","surface_form":"genetic analyses","offset":207},{"uri":"Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group","surface_form":"Angiosperm Phylogeny Group","offset":231},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":288},{"uri":"Nymphaeales","surface_form":"Nymphaeales","offset":440},{"uri":"Amborella","surface_form":"Amborella","offset":587}]}
