{"id":68079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugly_Betty","text":"\"Ugly Betty\" is a Golden Globe- and Peabody Award-winning American comedy-drama television series. It stars America Ferrera, Vanessa Williams, and Eric Mabius. It premiered on September 28, 2006, on ABC in the United States. The series follows the life of Betty Suarez (Ferrera), and her incongruous job at the ultra-chic New York City fashion magazine \"Mode\". Betty's status as a \"fish out of water\" drives much of the plot. Ugly Betty ended on April 14, 2010 after low ratings during season 4.\nIn popular culture.\nSince the show's debut, the main characters have become the latest fixures in the lexicon of pop media culture. They have already had parodies, news media stories and art-imitating-life situations, as well as recognition from the United States Congress itself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award","surface_form":"Golden Globe","offset":18},{"uri":"Peabody_Award","surface_form":"Peabody Award","offset":36},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":58},{"uri":"Comedy-drama","surface_form":"comedy-drama","offset":67},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":80},{"uri":"America_Ferrera","surface_form":"America Ferrera","offset":108},{"uri":"Vanessa_L._Williams","surface_form":"Vanessa Williams","offset":125},{"uri":"Eric_Mabius","surface_form":"Eric Mabius","offset":147},{"uri":"September_28","surface_form":"September 28","offset":176},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":190},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":199},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":210},{"uri":"Betty_Suarez","surface_form":"Betty Suarez","offset":256},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":322},{"uri":"Fish_out_of_water","surface_form":"fish out of water","offset":382},{"uri":"April_14","surface_form":"April 14","offset":446},{"uri":"2010","surface_form":"2010","offset":456},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"United States Congress","offset":746}]}
