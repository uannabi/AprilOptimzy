By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of.\nDue to the massive dust storms on Mars in 2018, \"Opportunity\" stopped communications on June 10, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once the atmosphere cleared. However it did not, as it either suffered a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust has covered its solar panels.\nOn February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the \"Opportunity\" mission was complete, after the spacecraft failed to respond to repeated signals sent since August 2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Robotics","surface_form":"robotic","offset":100},{"uri":"Rover","surface_form":"rover","offset":108},{"uri":"Mars","surface_form":"Mars","offset":133},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":201},{"uri":"Mars_Exploration_Rover","surface_form":"Mars Exploration Rover","offset":208},{"uri":"Meridiani_Planum","surface_form":"Meridiani Planum","offset":253},{"uri":"Spirit_(rover)","surface_form":"Spirit","offset":319},{"uri":"Sol_(day_on_Mars)","surface_form":"sol","offset":404},{"uri":"Solar_power","surface_form":"solar power","offset":713},{"uri":"Dust_storms","surface_form":"dust storms","offset":909}]}
