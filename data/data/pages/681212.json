The winners of these matches are chosen by the writers of the stories from WWE.\nThe winner of the tournament would receive a championship match of their choice for either the United Kingdom, North American, NXT, or Cruiserweight Championship (but he could only choose the Cruiserweight Championship if he weighed less than 205 pounds).\nOn January 10, there was an announcement that there would be a 15-man Battle Royal at the show.
