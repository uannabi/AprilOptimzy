{"id":681220,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Point_Hurricane_Barrier","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is a 3,000 foot long barrier across the Providence River in Providence, Rhode Island. It was built between 1960 and 1966. It protects the low-lying downtown area of the city from damaging storm surges and flooding due to hurricanes or other storms.\nBefore the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier was built, storm surges caused by hurricanes killed people and caused damage. The 1938 New England hurricane caused $120 million (1938 USD) of damage in Providence and nearby areas. Almost sixteen years later, Hurricane Carol caused an eight-foot-high storm surge. Damage was $41 million.\nThe barrier cost $14 million to build.\nTimes the barrier was used.\nIn 1985, the barrier was closed to protect the city from the storm surge of Hurricane Gloria.\nIn 1991, it was closed to protect the city from four feet of water from Hurricane Bob.\nOn October 28-29, 2012, the barrier was closed because of Hurricane Sandy. The storm's tidal surge was 9.5 feet high.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Providence_River","surface_form":"Providence River","offset":85},{"uri":"Providence%2C_Rhode_Island","surface_form":"Providence, Rhode Island","offset":105},{"uri":"Storm_surge","surface_form":"storm surge","offset":233},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"hurricanes","offset":266},{"uri":"1938_New_England_hurricane","surface_form":"1938 New England hurricane","offset":415},{"uri":"Hurricane_Carol","surface_form":"Hurricane Carol","offset":543},{"uri":"Hurricane_Gloria","surface_form":"Hurricane Gloria","offset":765},{"uri":"Hurricane_Bob","surface_form":"Hurricane Bob","offset":855},{"uri":"Hurricane_Sandy_(2012)","surface_form":"Hurricane Sandy","offset":928}]}
