{"id":68143,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judeo-Arabic_languages","text":"Judeo-Arabic languages are a collection of Arabic language dialects spoken by Jews living or formerly living in Arabic-speaking countries. Just as with the rest of the Arab world, Arabic-speaking Jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived. Most Jud\u00E6o-Arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the Hebrew alphabet, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet.\nIn retaliation for 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews in Arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence, causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to Israel. Their dialects of Arabic did not thrive in Israel, and most became extinct, replaced by the Modern Hebrew language.\nIn the Middle Ages, Jews in the Islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of Arabic, which they wrote in a mildly adapted Hebrew script (rather than using Arabic script).\nThis phenomenon is called Judaeo-Arabic and may be compared to both Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) and Yiddish (Judaeo-German).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic language","offset":43},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialects","offset":59},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jews","offset":78},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":128},{"uri":"Hebrew_alphabet","surface_form":"Hebrew alphabet","offset":333},{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":366},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic alphabet","offset":390},{"uri":"1948_Arab-Israeli_War","surface_form":"1948 Arab-Israeli War","offset":492},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":582},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":601},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":661},{"uri":"Modern_Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Modern Hebrew language","offset":761},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":792},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":805},{"uri":"Islamic","surface_form":"Islamic","offset":817},{"uri":"Diaspora","surface_form":"diaspora","offset":825},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":853},{"uri":"Hebrew_alphabet","surface_form":"Hebrew script","offset":898},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic script","offset":931},{"uri":"Judaeo-Spanish","surface_form":"Ladino","offset":1015},{"uri":"Yiddish","surface_form":"Yiddish","offset":1043}]}
