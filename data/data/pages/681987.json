{"id":681987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima","text":"Optima is a sans serif typeface. It was designed by Hermann Zapf. Some of the lines are a little wider at the ends, which looks a little like serifs but is not.\nOptima was inspired by classical Roman capital letters and the stone-carving of Renaissance period tombstones Zapf saw in Florence, Italy in 1950 on a holiday.\nZapf intended Optima to be a typeface that could be used for both body text and for titles. Zapf used only this typeface in his book \"About Alphabets\".\nThe first release of Optima is the one used the most. Like many sans serif fonts, it has an oblique style instead of an italic. In Optima nova, a later release, this is replaced by a true italic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sans_serif","surface_form":"sans serif","offset":12},{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"typeface","offset":23},{"uri":"Hermann_Zapf","surface_form":"Hermann Zapf","offset":52},{"uri":"Serif","surface_form":"serif","offset":142},{"uri":"Letter_case","surface_form":"capital letters","offset":200},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":241},{"uri":"Tombstone","surface_form":"tombstone","offset":260},{"uri":"Florence","surface_form":"Florence","offset":283},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":293},{"uri":"Oblique_type","surface_form":"oblique","offset":565},{"uri":"Italic","surface_form":"italic","offset":593}]}
