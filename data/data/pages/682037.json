{"id":682037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_Regis_Museum","text":"The Lyme Regis Museum is a local museum in the town of Lyme Regis on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, England. It is built on the site of the birthplace and home of Mary Anning, the fossil hunter. Her family ran a shop here.\nThe collections show fossils from the surrounding area dating from the Jurassic period. It includes local maritime history, memorabilia, and writers associated with the town such as Jane Austen and John Fowles.\nAn example of Coade artificial stonework, in the form of ammonites, is set into the pavement outside the museum. This touches both local history (Eleanor Coade, the inventor of Coade stone) and the palaeontology for which Lyme Regis is famous.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":33},{"uri":"Lyme_Regis","surface_form":"Lyme Regis","offset":55},{"uri":"Jurassic_Coast","surface_form":"Jurassic Coast","offset":73},{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":91},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":99},{"uri":"Mary_Anning","surface_form":"Mary Anning","offset":162},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":179},{"uri":"Jurassic_period","surface_form":"Jurassic period","offset":293},{"uri":"Jane_Austen","surface_form":"Jane Austen","offset":404},{"uri":"John_Fowles","surface_form":"John Fowles","offset":420},{"uri":"Coade_stone","surface_form":"Coade","offset":447},{"uri":"Ammonite","surface_form":"ammonite","offset":490},{"uri":"Eleanor_Coade","surface_form":"Eleanor Coade","offset":579},{"uri":"Palaeontology","surface_form":"palaeontology","offset":631}]}
