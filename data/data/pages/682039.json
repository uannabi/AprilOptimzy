The museum is in a historic Grade I listed former congregational church building.\nThe museum is owned and run by Steve Davies, a former chief palaeontologist for BP. It contains a collection of local marine fossils from the Jurassic period. The museum organizes guided fossil hunting walks. There is a museum shop that sells fossils and minerals.\nAs well as local Jurassic fossils, there are dinosaurs from China. There are also modern shells and skeletons on display. The museum has a small collection of dinosaur fossils on show (such as a large dinosaur coprolite, a \"Megalosaurus\" skeleton and a Chinese dinosaur, of unknown genus).\nCongregational Church.\nThe museum is on Coombe Street in a 250-year-old Grade I listed building that used to be a congregational church. The church was built between 1750 and 1755 by John Whitty. It was where Mary Anning (1799\u20131847), an early fossil hunter, was baptised and later attended for worship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Museum","surface_form":"museum","offset":74},{"uri":"Lyme_Regis","surface_form":"Lyme Regis","offset":84},{"uri":"Jurassic_Coast","surface_form":"Jurassic Coast","offset":103},{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":121},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":129},{"uri":"Grade_I_listed","surface_form":"Grade I listed","offset":166},{"uri":"Congregational_church","surface_form":"congregational church","offset":188},{"uri":"Palaeontologist","surface_form":"palaeontologist","offset":280},{"uri":"BP","surface_form":"BP","offset":300},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":345},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":362},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":545},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":644},{"uri":"Coprolite","surface_form":"coprolite","offset":695},{"uri":"Megalosaurus","surface_form":"Megalosaurus","offset":709},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":767},{"uri":"Listed_building","surface_form":"listed building","offset":855},{"uri":"Mary_Anning","surface_form":"Mary Anning","offset":984}]}
