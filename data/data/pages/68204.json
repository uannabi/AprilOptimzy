{"id":68204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Winter_Olympics","text":"The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and opened by Governor General Jeanne Sauv\u00E9. The Olympics were highly successful financially as they brought in million-dollar profits. The games left a lasting impression on the host city and gave it a new identity from a cowtown to a large commercial sector of the country.\n1988 was also the last year that the Paralympic Games and the Winter Olympics were held in separate cities; all subsequent games have been hosted by the same city or a city nearby.\nAs at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the Canadian team failed to win a gold medal, matching only Yugoslavia in the dubious distinction of not having won a winter gold medal on home soil.\nBackground.\nCalgary first tried for the Olympics in 1964, and again in 1968.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"Winter Olympics","offset":9},{"uri":"Calgary%2C_Alberta","surface_form":"Calgary","offset":88},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":97},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":106},{"uri":"Jeanne_Sauv%C3%A9","surface_form":"Jeanne Sauv\u00E9","offset":144},{"uri":"Paralympic_Games","surface_form":"Paralympic Games","offset":426},{"uri":"1976_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1976 Summer Olympics","offset":580},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":604}]}
