{"id":682085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman","text":"e=\"preserve\">Times New Roman is a serif typeface. It was made for legibility (easy reading) in body text. It was created by the British newspaper \"The Times\" in 1931. It was made by Stanley Morison, the artistic advisor to the British part of the newspaper. Victor Lardent, a lettering artist at \"Times\" advertising department, helped him make it.\nThe font is no longer used by the \"Times\" newspaper. It is used mostly in books and general printing. It has become a regular typeface used on most computers.\nAs a typeface used for newspapers, Times New Roman allows tight line-spacing and a smaller appearance. It was first seen in the \"Times\" on 3 October 1932.\nDesign.\nTimes New Roman is packed together, with tall lowercase letters. These things make it easier to read.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serif","surface_form":"serif","offset":34},{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"typeface","offset":40},{"uri":"Legibility","surface_form":"legibility","offset":66},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":128},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":136},{"uri":"Advisor","surface_form":"advisor","offset":212},{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"typeface","offset":474},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":496}]}
