He tortured men and women and was even said to have gouged his godson's eyes out with his own fingernails.\nDuring the English Civil War, in 1646, Oliver Cromwell and his cavaliers attacked roundhead Bridgnorth. By the time the castle was in ruins, the entire town was on fire. After a three-week siege, Cromwell was successful and he ordered that the castle be demolished in 1647.\nThe castle leans at more of an angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa by 4 times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":23},{"uri":"Bridgnorth","surface_form":"Bridgnorth","offset":45},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":57},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":69},{"uri":"English_Civil_War","surface_form":"English Civil War","offset":258},{"uri":"Oliver_Cromwell","surface_form":"Oliver Cromwell","offset":286},{"uri":"Cavaliers","surface_form":"cavaliers","offset":310},{"uri":"Roundheads","surface_form":"roundhead","offset":329},{"uri":"Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa","surface_form":"Leaning Tower of Pisa","offset":567}]}
