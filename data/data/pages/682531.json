Its body is grayish brown on light yellow, and it has a dark brown line on its back.\nThese fish usually lay eggs in spring and summer. They have very strong kidneys, so they can tolerate more salt than most freshwater fish. If they get used to it slowly, they can live in seawater.\nThese fish live about one year and several months.\nAppearance.\nThey are approximately 3.5 cm long. Thier dorsal and ventral fins are far in the back of their bodies.\nRelationship with humans.\nThe medaka fish spawn at about the same time of year that people put water into rice paddies, so they often live in the paddies.\nFood and water.\nThese fish eat zooplankton and the larva of mosquitoes, which live in the water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
