{"id":682564,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_algorithm","text":"In computer science, a holographic algorithm is an algorithm \u2013 a set of steps \u2013 that uses a holographic reduction. A holographic reduction always takes the same amount of time, and makes a big problem easier to solve. Holographic algorithms are not like laser holography, except metaphorically.\nPeople have used holographic algorithms to find polynomial-time (\"efficient\") ways to solve problems related to mathematical graphs, like satisfiability. Holographic algorithms may be connected to the P versus NP problem or computational complexity theory.\nHolographic algorithms are like quantum computation in some ways, but they work with completely normal computers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":3},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":51},{"uri":"Laser","surface_form":"laser","offset":254},{"uri":"Holography","surface_form":"holography","offset":260},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphorically","offset":279},{"uri":"P_(complexity)","surface_form":"polynomial-time","offset":343},{"uri":"Graph_theory","surface_form":"mathematical graphs","offset":407},{"uri":"Boolean_satisfiability_problem","surface_form":"satisfiability","offset":433},{"uri":"P_versus_NP_problem","surface_form":"P versus NP problem","offset":496},{"uri":"Computational_complexity_theory","surface_form":"computational complexity theory","offset":519},{"uri":"Quantum_computation","surface_form":"quantum computation","offset":584}]}
