{"id":68258,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa","text":"Kappa (uppercase/lowercase \u039A \u03BA) is the letter of the Greek alphabet used to represent the \"k\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 20. Letters that came from it include the Roman K and Cyrillic \u041A.\nThe letter \u03BA always stands for the sound \"k\" in Greek. It is customary to transliterate (re-write) \u03BA as \"c\" in English, but this is somewhat problematic since c is pronounced as \"s\" before e, i and y (which does not happen in Greek).\nIn mathematics, the lowercase formula_1 is used to represent the curvature of a curve, while the uppercase \u039A is used to represent an ordinal number which is also a cardinal number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":53},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient","offset":103},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern","offset":115},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":146},{"uri":"K","surface_form":"K","offset":228},{"uri":"%D0%9A","surface_form":"\u041A","offset":243},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":483},{"uri":"Curvature","surface_form":"curvature","offset":545},{"uri":"Ordinal_number","surface_form":"ordinal number","offset":613},{"uri":"Cardinal_number","surface_form":"cardinal number","offset":644}]}
