{"id":68277,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_Yoga","text":"=\"preserve\">In Hinduism, Jnana Yoga is the yoga or practice of knowledge. Jy\u00E2na in Sanskrit means \"knowledge\".\nIn the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says that jy\u00E2na consists of properly understanding \"kshetra\" (the field of activity\u2014that is, the body) and \"kshetra-jna\" (the knower of the body\u2014that is, the soul). Krishna emphasizes one must understand the difference between these two. \"Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":15},{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"yoga","offset":43},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":83}]}
