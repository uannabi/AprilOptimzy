{"id":68290,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book","text":"An electronic book (also called an e-book, ebook or digital book) is a book in digital form. E-books can be read on computers or other electronic devices such as e-book readers. E-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle, the Kobo eReader and the Barnes and Noble Nook are devices which are dedicated to showing e-books.\nHistory.\nThe first e-book might have been the Index Thonisticus, prepared by Roberto Busa in the late 1940s. However, this is sometimes not called an ebook because the digital text was (at least at first) meant to develop an index and concordance, rather than as a published edition in its own rights.\nDespite the extensive earlier history, it is commonly reported that the inventor of the e-book is Michael S. Hart. In 1971, Hart was given extensive computer time by the operators of the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the University of Illinois. Seeking a worthy use of this resource, he created his first electronic document by typing the United States Declaration of Independence into a computer.\nOne early e-book was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer, the Dynabook, in the 1970s at PARC: a general-purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading.\nIn 1992, Sony launched the Data Discman, an electronic book reader that could read e-books that were stored on CDs. One of the electronic publications that could be played on the Data Discman was called The Library of the Future.\nEarly e-books were generally written for specialty areas and a limited audience, meant to be read only by small and devoted interest groups. The scope of the subject matter of these e-books included technical manuals for hardware, manufacturing techniques and other subjects. In the 1990s, the general availability of the Internet made transferring electronic files much easier, including e-books.\nThe current eBook standard is the EPUB file. There are other proprietary formats like.MOBI, AZW, IBA and PDF.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":116},{"uri":"E-book_reader","surface_form":"e-book reader","offset":162},{"uri":"Amazon_Kindle","surface_form":"Amazon Kindle","offset":206},{"uri":"Barnes_%26amp%3B_Noble_Nook","surface_form":"Barnes and Noble Nook","offset":246},{"uri":"Michael_S._Hart","surface_form":"Michael S.
