{"id":68291,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis","text":"=\"preserve\">The Church-Turing thesis (also known as Church's thesis, Church's conjecture and Turing's thesis) is a statement about computers. It says that a very simple kind of computer now named a \u201CTuring machine\u201D is able to compute all computable functions. The Church-Turing thesis is linked to G\u00F6del's incompleteness theorems.\nWhen a programming language is able to do what a Turing machine can do, that language is called Turing complete. If a problem is solvable in one such language, then it is solvable in all of those.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":131},{"uri":"Turing_machine","surface_form":"Turing machine","offset":199},{"uri":"G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems","surface_form":"G\u00F6del's incompleteness theorems","offset":298},{"uri":"Turing_complete","surface_form":"Turing complete","offset":427}]}
