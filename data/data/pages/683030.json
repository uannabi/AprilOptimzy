{"id":683030,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_VI_of_Navarre","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sancho Garc\u00E9s VI (; 21 April 1132 - 27 June 1194), called the Wise (,) was King of Navarre from 1150 until his death in 1194. He was the first monarch to officially drop the title of \"King of Pamplona\" in favour of King of Navarre. With this action, he also changed the name of his kingdom. Sancho Garc\u00E9s was responsible for bringing his kingdom into the political orbit of Europe. He was the eldest son of Garc\u00EDa Ram\u00EDrez, \"the Restorer\" and Margaret of L'Aigle.\nBiography.\nSancho VI inherited a debilitated kingdom, subject of frequent raids by the Kingdom of Castile of Alfonso VII and by the County of Barcelona of Ramon Berenguer IV, also king of Aragon, who in 1140 had agreed the partition of the kingdom in the Treaty of Carri\u00F3n.\nHe tried to repair the borders of his kingdom, which had been reduced by the Treaties of Tudej\u00E9n and Carri\u00F3n, which he had been forced to sign with Castile and Arag\u00F3n in his early reign. By the Accord of Soria, Castile was eventually confirmed in its possession of conquered territories. In the face of a possible Castilian military takeover of further western Navarrese territories, Sancho VI re-asserted royal authority by founding several towns in 1181, including San Sebasti\u00E1n, Vitoria and Trevi\u00F1o, among others.\nHe was hostile to Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, but Raymond's son King Alfonso II of Aragon divided the lands taken from Murcia with him by treaty of Sang\u00FCesa in 1168. In 1190, the two neighbours again signed a pact in Borja of mutual protection against Castilian expansion.\nHe died on 27 June 1194, in Pamplona, where he is buried.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Navarre","surface_form":"King of Navarre","offset":88},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":387},{"uri":"Garc%C3%ADa_Ram%C3%ADrez_of_Navarre","surface_form":"Garc\u00EDa Ram\u00EDrez, \"the Restorer\"","offset":420},{"uri":"Margaret_of_L%27Aigle","surface_form":"Margaret of L'Aigle","offset":455},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Castile","surface_form":"Kingdom of Castile","offset":563},{"uri":"Alfonso_VII_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile","surface_form":"Alfonso VII","offset":585},{"uri":"County_of_Barcelona","surface_form":"County of Barcelona","offset":608},{"uri":"Ramon_Berenguer_IV%2C_Count_of_Barcelona","surface_form":"Ramon Berenguer IV","offset":631},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":664},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Tudej%C3%A9n","surface_form":"Treaties of Tudej\u00E9n","offset":827},{"uri":"Soria","surface_form":"Soria","offset":954},{"uri":"San_Sebasti%C3%A1n","surface_form":"San Sebasti\u00E1n","offset":1217},{"uri":"Vitoria-Gasteiz","surface_form":"Vitoria","offset":1232},{"uri":"County_of_Trevi%C3%B1o","surface_form":"Trevi\u00F1o","offset":1244},{"uri":"Ramon_Berenguer_IV%2C_Count_of_Barcelona","surface_form":"Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona","offset":1285},{"uri":"Alfonso_II_of_Aragon","surface_form":"King Alfonso II of Aragon","offset":1343},{"uri":"Murcia","surface_form":"Murcia","offset":1398},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Sang%C3%BCesa","surface_form":"treaty of Sang\u00FCesa","offset":1417},{"uri":"Borja%2C_Zaragoza","surface_form":"Borja","offset":1496}]}
