{"id":683125,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogana","text":"Dogana is a town and a civil parish (curazia), whose name means 'Customs House'; it is found in the north-eastern corner of San Marino in the Serravalle municipality ('castello'). The town is the most populated settlement in the republic.\nGeography.\nThe town is found at the northernmost point of San Marino after Falciano, close to the border with Italy, in the province of Rimini.\nHistory.\nIt has a population of roughly 7,000. Because of its size, in 2006 it asked to split away from Serravalle and become its own \"castello\", but in 2007 the proposal was refused. Partial autonomy is seen in Dogana's having its own postal code (47891), while the rest of Serravalle carries 47899.\nEconomy.\nDogana is the main entry point for travellers arriving into San Marino from Italy (by freeway no. 72 from Rimini). Although \"Dogana\" means \"customs house\" in Italian, there are no border formalities anywhere on the border between Italy and San Marino.\nSport.\nThe local football team is the Juvenes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"San_Marino","surface_form":"San Marino","offset":124},{"uri":"Serravalle_(San_Marino)","surface_form":"Serravalle","offset":142},{"uri":"Falciano","surface_form":"Falciano","offset":314},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":349},{"uri":"Province_of_Rimini","surface_form":"province of Rimini","offset":363},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":769},{"uri":"Rimini","surface_form":"Rimini","offset":799},{"uri":"Custom_House","surface_form":"customs house","offset":833},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":923},{"uri":"A.C._Juvenes/Dogana","surface_form":"Juvenes","offset":983}]}
