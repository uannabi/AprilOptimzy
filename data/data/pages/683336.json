{"id":683336,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopropane","text":"Cyclopropane is the cycloalkane molecule with the formula, with three carbon atoms connected to each other in a ring structure, and each carbon atom being connected to two hydrogen atoms. The ring is very small, and ring strain can take place because of this.\nCyclopropane is an anesthetic, meaning inhaling large quantities of the gas form that evaporates can send somebody to sleep, however today, other chemicals are used by medical professionals. It is also very reactive, and can explode when mixed with oxygen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cycloalkane","surface_form":"cycloalkane","offset":20},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":32},{"uri":"Molecular_formula","surface_form":"formula","offset":50},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":77},{"uri":"Ring_strain","surface_form":"ring strain","offset":216},{"uri":"Anesthetic","surface_form":"anesthetic","offset":279},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":332},{"uri":"Evaporation","surface_form":"evaporates","offset":346},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":378},{"uri":"Reactivity","surface_form":"reactive","offset":467},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explode","offset":485},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":509}]}
