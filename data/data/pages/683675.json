{"id":683675,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_type","text":"=\"preserve\">An oblique type is a form of type that slants slightly to the right. It is used for the same purposes as italic type. But unlike italic type, it does not use different glyph shapes. It uses the same glyphs as Roman type, except slanted.\nType designers have called oblique as less organic and calligraphic than italics. That may be preferred in some situations.\nMany sans serif typefaces use oblique designs instead of italic ones. This is especially true with grotesque designs like Helvetica.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"type","offset":41},{"uri":"Italic_type","surface_form":"italic type","offset":117},{"uri":"Glyph","surface_form":"glyph","offset":180},{"uri":"Latin_script","surface_form":"Roman type","offset":221},{"uri":"Calligraphy","surface_form":"calligraphic","offset":304},{"uri":"Sans_serif","surface_form":"sans serif","offset":378},{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"typeface","offset":389},{"uri":"Italic_type","surface_form":"italic","offset":430},{"uri":"Sans_serif","surface_form":"grotesque","offset":472},{"uri":"Helvetica","surface_form":"Helvetica","offset":495}]}
