It was a backup mission of Soyuz 10, which was failed to dock. The mission killed three men in space. They were Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev.\nCrew notes.\nAn X-ray testing of the original crew found that Kubasov might have tuberculosis. According to the mission rules, the backup crew replaced the original crew. Dobrovolski and Patsayev never flew to space before. Kubasov and Leonov became the crew to Soyuz 19 for the Apollo-Soyuz in 1975.\nDeath of crew.\nOn 30 June 1971, after returing to the Earth of the capsule, the recovery team knocked on the side. There was no response. Opening the hatch, they found all three men in their couch<nowiki/>es, no motion. There had dark-blue patches on their faces and trails of blood from their noses and ears. They brought them out from the capsule. Dobrovolsky was still warm. According to their reports, the reason of death was suffocation.\nThe cosmonauts were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square, Moscow near the remains of Yuri Gagarin. US astronaut Tom Stafford was one of the pallbearer<nowiki/>s. They were also each awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salyut","surface_form":"Salyut","offset":72},{"uri":"Georgy_Dobrovolsky","surface_form":"Georgy Dobrovolsky","offset":219},{"uri":"Vladislav_Volkov","surface_form":"Vladislav Volkov","offset":239},{"uri":"Viktor_Patsayev","surface_form":"Viktor Patsayev","offset":261},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":293},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":358},{"uri":"Soyuz_19","surface_form":"Soyuz 19","offset":539},{"uri":"Response","surface_form":"response","offset":706},{"uri":"Hatch","surface_form":"hatch","offset":728},{"uri":"Couch","surface_form":"couch","offset":769},{"uri":"Kremlin_Wall_Necropolis","surface_form":"Kremlin Wall Necropolis","offset":1055},{"uri":"Red_Square","surface_form":"Red Square","offset":1082},{"uri":"Yuri_Gagarin","surface_form":"Yuri Gagarin","offset":1121},{"uri":"Astronaut","surface_form":"astronaut","offset":1138},{"uri":"Pallbearer","surface_form":"pallbearer","offset":1176},{"uri":"Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Hero of the Soviet Union","offset":1230}]}
