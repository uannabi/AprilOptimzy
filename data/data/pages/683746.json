{"id":683746,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space_and_time","text":"=\"preserve\">Absolute space and time are concepts used by Aristotle and by Newton. They are still used in classical mechanics. Even in Newtonian mechanics, the notion of inertial frame of reference is used.\nThe concepts of space and time were separate before special relativity theory, which connected the two. It showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame's motion. In Einstein's theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were replaced by the idea of spacetime in special relativity, and curved spacetime in general relativity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aristotle","surface_form":"Aristotle","offset":57},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Newton","offset":74},{"uri":"Mechanics","surface_form":"mechanics","offset":115},{"uri":"Frame_of_reference","surface_form":"frame of reference","offset":178},{"uri":"Space","surface_form":"space","offset":222},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":232},{"uri":"Special_relativity","surface_form":"special relativity","offset":258},{"uri":"Einstein","surface_form":"Einstein","offset":379},{"uri":"Spacetime","surface_form":"spacetime","offset":466},{"uri":"Special_relativity","surface_form":"special relativity","offset":479},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":523}]}
