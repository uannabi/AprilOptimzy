He has been called a neo-Nazi. Spencer created the term \"alt-right\", which he thinks is a movement about \"white identity\".\nSpencer was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He was raised in Dallas, Texas and in Whitefish, Montana. Spencer studied at the University of Virginia and at the University of Chicago.\nLike many white supremacists, he supported Donald Trump when he ran for president in 2016. However, by 2020 he felt it was a bad choice. He decided to support Joe Biden in the 2020 elections, but Biden's team said he didn't want his support.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"White_supremacist","surface_form":"white supremacist","offset":60},{"uri":"National_Policy_Institute","surface_form":"National Policy Institute","offset":102},{"uri":"Think_tank","surface_form":"think tank","offset":155},{"uri":"Washington_Summit_Publishers","surface_form":"Washington Summit Publishers","offset":178},{"uri":"White_nationalist","surface_form":"white nationalist","offset":284},{"uri":"Neo-Nazism","surface_form":"neo-Nazi","offset":324},{"uri":"Alt-right","surface_form":"alt-right","offset":360},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":446},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":454},{"uri":"Dallas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":486},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":494},{"uri":"Whitefish%2C_Montana","surface_form":"Whitefish","offset":507},{"uri":"Montana","surface_form":"Montana","offset":518},{"uri":"University_of_Virginia","surface_form":"University of Virginia","offset":550},{"uri":"University_of_Chicago","surface_form":"University of Chicago","offset":584},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":650},{"uri":"2016_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"ran for president in 2016","offset":671},{"uri":"Joe_Biden","surface_form":"Joe Biden","offset":766},{"uri":"2020_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"2020 elections","offset":783}]}
