{"id":684282,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Cuba","text":"The Communist Party of Cuba is the ruling political party in Cuba. It is a Marxist\u2013Leninist communist party. The Cuban constitution describes the role of the party to be the \"leading force of society and of the state\". Since April 2011, the First Secretary of the Central Committee has been Ra\u00FAl Castro, younger brother of the previous First Secretary Fidel Castro, who died on 25 November 2016. The Second Secretary has been Jos\u00E9 Ram\u00F3n Machado Ventura.\nHistory.\nOn 26 March 1962, the ORI became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC), which became the Communist Party of Cuba on 3 October 1965. In Article 5 of the Cuban constitution of 1976, the Communist Party is recognized as \"the superior guiding force of society and of the State, that organizes and orients common efforts toward the high goals of the construction of socialism and the advancement toward communist society\". All parties, including the Communist Party, are prohibited from advertizing their organizations.\nFor the first fifteen years of its existence, the Communist Party was almost completely inactive outside of the Politburo. The 100 person Central Committee rarely met and the first regular party Congress was held ten years after its founding. In 1969, membership of the party was only 55,000 (0.7% of the population), making the PCC the smallest ruling communist party in the world. By the time of the first party Congress in 1975, the party had grown to just over two hundred thousand members. By 1980, the party had grown to over 430,000 members and it grew further to 520,000 by 1985.\nCentral Committee.\nThe leading bodies of the party were the Politburo and the Secretariat until 1991. In 1991 the two bodies were merged into an expanded Politburo with over twenty members. However, the Secretariat was re-introduced in 2002. There is also a Central Committee which meets between party congresses. At the Fifth Congress, the size of the Central Committee was reduced to 150 members from the previous membership of 225. Fidel Castro was the party's First Secretary (or leader) since its creation while Ra\u00FAl Castro was the Second Secretary. Upon Fidel Castro's 2008 resignation from the party and Cuban government, Ra\u00FAl Castro became First Secretary.\nPolitburo.\nThe 7th Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba was elected by the Central Committee on 19 April 2016 following the 7th Congress.\nYouth.\nThe Communist Party of Cuba has a youth wing, the Young Communist League (\"Uni\u00F3n de J\u00F3venes Comunistas\", UJC) which is a member organization of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. It also has a children's group, the Jos\u00E9 Mart\u00ED Pioneer Organization.\nIdeology.\nCompared with other ruling Communist Parties, the Communist Party of Cuba retains a stricter adherence to the tradition of Marxism\u2013Leninism and the traditional Soviet model.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["political party"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":42},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":61},{"uri":"Marxism-Leninism","surface_form":"Marxist\u2013Leninist","offset":75},{"uri":"Communist_party","surface_form":"communist party","offset":92},{"uri":"Cuban_constitution","surface_form":"Cuban constitution","offset":113},{"uri":"First_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"First Secretary of the Central Committee","offset":241},{"uri":"Ra%C3%BAl_Castro","surface_form":"Ra\u00FAl Castro","offset":291},{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":352},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Ram%C3%B3n_Machado_Ventura","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Ram\u00F3n Machado Ventura","offset":426},{"uri":"Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"Politburo","offset":1111},{"uri":"Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"party Congress","offset":1188},{"uri":"Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"Politburo","offset":1647},{"uri":"Secretariat_of_the_Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"Secretariat","offset":1665},{"uri":"Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"Central Committee","offset":2356},{"uri":"7th_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_Cuba","surface_form":"7th Congress","offset":2405},{"uri":"Young_Communist_League_(Cuba)","surface_form":"Young Communist League","offset":2476},{"uri":"World_Federation_of_Democratic_Youth","surface_form":"World Federation of Democratic Youth","offset":2574},{"uri":"Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD_Pioneer_Organization","surface_form":"Jos\u00E9 Mart\u00ED Pioneer Organization","offset":2648},{"uri":"Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism","surface_form":"Marxism\u2013Leninism","offset":2814},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet model","offset":2851}]}
