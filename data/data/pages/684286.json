{"id":684286,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almendares_River","text":"The Almendares River is a 45\u00A0km river in the western part of Cuba. It originates from the east of Tapaste and flows north-west into the Straits of Florida. The river is a water supply for Havana.\nThe river divides two districts of Havana: the Plaza de la Revoluci\u00F3n (Miramar) and Playa (Vedado). Part of the river valley forms the Almendares Park or Metropolitan Park of Havana (PMH), a few kilometers upstream from the ocean.\nThere are several industrial plants along the river banks (paper mills, gas production plants, brewery, food production plants, construction plants).\nThe Havana authorities continue to monitor and control water pollution, reduce and rationalize\nindustrial occupation, maintain the old trees and the vegetation in the park. The area is gradually becoming a green oasis with playground, a few restaurants and footpaths.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":61},{"uri":"Tapaste","surface_form":"Tapaste","offset":98},{"uri":"Straits_of_Florida","surface_form":"Straits of Florida","offset":136},{"uri":"Havana","surface_form":"Havana","offset":188},{"uri":"Plaza_de_la_Revoluci%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Plaza de la Revoluci\u00F3n","offset":243},{"uri":"Miramar%2C_Havana","surface_form":"Miramar","offset":267},{"uri":"Playa%2C_Havana","surface_form":"Playa","offset":280},{"uri":"Vedado","surface_form":"Vedado","offset":287},{"uri":"Brewery","surface_form":"brewery","offset":522},{"uri":"Water_pollution","surface_form":"water pollution","offset":632}]}
