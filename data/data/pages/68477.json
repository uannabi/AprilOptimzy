{"id":68477,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dragon","text":"A Japanese dragon, also known as is a mythical animal from Japan.\nLike other creatures called dragons, the Ry\u016B is a big, fantastic animal that looks similar to a serpent, and is related to the Chinese \"l\u00F3ng\" and the Korean \"yong\". Like all these Asian dragons, it is shown without wings, has legs with claws, and usually lives in the ocean, the clouds, or heavens. Japanese dragons do not fly as often as the Chinese one, which is the reason why they usually appear much more like serpents. The \"ry\u016B\" in art has only three toes, instead of the \"l\u00F3ng's\" five or the \"yong's\" four.\nJapanese dragons usually live in the sea. This is because Japan is an island, and the sea is present in most of its geography.\n\"Ry\u016B\" originated from China and is one of the four creatures from heavens of Japanese mythology (the other three are the phoenix, turtle and tiger). It has often been the symbol of the Emperor or of a hero.\nDragons in Japanese mythology.\nIn Japanese mythology, one of the first dragons is the Yamata-no-Orochi, a very big serpent with eight heads and eight tails. The serpent ate girls, and it was killed by Susanoo after Susanoo tricked the creature into becoming drunk on sake.\nDragons in later Japanese folklore were often good, perhaps because of influence from Chinese culture. In Urashima Tar\u014D, the main character rescues a turtle which turns out to be the son of Ry\u016Bjin, the dragon king of the ocean.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":38},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":47},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":59},{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":77},{"uri":"Dragon","surface_form":"dragon","offset":94},{"uri":"Serpent","surface_form":"serpent","offset":162},{"uri":"Chinese_dragon","surface_form":"l\u00F3ng","offset":202},{"uri":"Korean_dragon","surface_form":"yong","offset":224},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":246},{"uri":"Claw","surface_form":"claw","offset":302},{"uri":"Toe","surface_form":"toe","offset":523},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":650},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":696},{"uri":"Fenghuang","surface_form":"phoenix","offset":828},{"uri":"Turtle","surface_form":"turtle","offset":837},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":848},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":878},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"Emperor","offset":892},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":908},{"uri":"Yamata-no-Orochi","surface_form":"Yamata-no-Orochi","offset":1000},{"uri":"Tail","surface_form":"tail","offset":1064},{"uri":"Girl","surface_form":"girl","offset":1087},{"uri":"Susanoo","surface_form":"Susanoo","offset":1115},{"uri":"Sake","surface_form":"sake","offset":1181},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":1258},{"uri":"Urashima_Tar%C5%8D","surface_form":"Urashima Tar\u014D","offset":1293},{"uri":"Ry%C5%ABjin","surface_form":"Ry\u016Bjin","offset":1377}]}
