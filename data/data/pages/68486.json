{"id":68486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mythology","text":"e=\"preserve\">Japanese mythology is a system of beliefs that includes Shinto and Buddhist traditions. The Shinto religion alone has many \"kami\" (Japanese for \"gods\" or \"spirits\").\nMost Japanese myths, as generally known today, are based on the \"Kojiki\", \"Nihonshoki\" and some other books. The \"Kojiki\" or \"Record of Ancient Things\" is the oldest known book of myths, legends, and history of Japan. The \"Shintoshu\" explains origins of Japanese gods and goddesses from a Buddhist point of view while the \"Hotsuma Tsutae\" has a very different version of mythology.\nOne notable thing of Japanese mythology is that it explains the origin of the Imperial family, and assigned them divinity. The Japanese word for the Emperor of Japan, \"tenn\u014D\" (\u5929\u7687), means \"heavenly emperor\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"System","surface_form":"system","offset":37},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":47},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":69},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":80},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":89},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":112},{"uri":"Kami","surface_form":"kami","offset":137},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":144},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":158},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":168},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":244},{"uri":"Nihonshoki","surface_form":"Nihonshoki","offset":254},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":359},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":366},{"uri":"History_of_Japan","surface_form":"history of Japan","offset":379},{"uri":"Shintoshu","surface_form":"Shintoshu","offset":402},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":468},{"uri":"Hotsuma_Tsutae","surface_form":"Hotsuma Tsutae","offset":502},{"uri":"Version","surface_form":"version","offset":539},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"Imperial family","offset":639},{"uri":"Divinity","surface_form":"divinity","offset":674},{"uri":"Emperor","surface_form":"emperor","offset":758}]}
