It is very influenced by Shinto and Buddhism, the two most important religions in the country. It usually includes humorous or strange characters and situations. It also includes many supernatural creatures, such as \"kami\" (gods and revered spirits), \"y\u014Dkai\" (monster-spirits) (like \"oni\", \"kappa\", and \"tengu\"), \"onry\u014D\" (ghosts), dragons, and animals with supernatural powers like the \"kitsune\" (fox), \"tanuki\" (raccoon dog), \"mujina\" (badger), and \"bakeneko\" (transforming cat).\nJapanese folklore is often divided into several categories: \"mukashibanashi,\" tales of long-ago; \"namidabanashi\", sad stories; \"obakebanashi\", ghost stories; \"ongaeshibanashi\", stories of kindness; \"tonchibanashi\", witty stories; \"waraibanashi\", funny stories; and \"yokubaribanashi\", stories of greed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Folklore","surface_form":"folklore","offset":38},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":50},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":68},{"uri":"Shinto","surface_form":"Shinto","offset":82},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":93},{"uri":"Humor","surface_form":"humor","offset":172},{"uri":"Supernatural","surface_form":"supernatural","offset":241},{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":254},{"uri":"Kami","surface_form":"kami","offset":274},{"uri":"Y%C5%8Dkai","surface_form":"y\u014Dkai","offset":309},{"uri":"Oni_(folklore)","surface_form":"oni","offset":341},{"uri":"Kappa_(folklore)","surface_form":"kappa","offset":348},{"uri":"Tengu","surface_form":"tengu","offset":361},{"uri":"Onry%C5%8D","surface_form":"onry\u014D","offset":371},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":379},{"uri":"Japanese_dragon","surface_form":"dragons","offset":388},{"uri":"Kitsune","surface_form":"kitsune","offset":444},{"uri":"Tanuki","surface_form":"tanuki","offset":461},{"uri":"Raccoon","surface_form":"raccoon","offset":470},{"uri":"Mujina","surface_form":"mujina","offset":485},{"uri":"Badger","surface_form":"badger","offset":494},{"uri":"Bakeneko","surface_form":"bakeneko","offset":508},{"uri":"Kindness","surface_form":"kindness","offset":726},{"uri":"Wit","surface_form":"wit","offset":753},{"uri":"Greed","surface_form":"greed","offset":833}]}
