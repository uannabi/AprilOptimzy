{"id":68503,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonality","text":"e=\"preserve\">Polytonality is the use in music of several keys at the same time. Music such as this is called polytonal.\nBitonality is the use in music of two keys at the same time. Music such as this is called bitonal.\nMost traditional music is \"in a particular key\" e.g. in \"C major\" or in \"D major\" or in \"D minor\". Music that is in C major uses the notes of a C major scale.\nIn 20th century some composers sometimes wrote music which is in more than one key at once. A well-known example is the beginning of the second tableau of Igor Stravinsky's ballet, \"Petrushka\". The first clarinet plays a melody that uses the notes of the C major chord, while the second clarinet plays a different version of the same melody using the notes of the F sharp major chord.\nComposers who have used bitonality or polytonality include Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k, Charles Ives and many others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":40},{"uri":"Tonality","surface_form":"keys","offset":57},{"uri":"Scale_(music)","surface_form":"scale","offset":371},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":381},{"uri":"Igor_Stravinsky","surface_form":"Igor Stravinsky","offset":533},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":551},{"uri":"Petrushka","surface_form":"Petrushka","offset":560},{"uri":"Clarinet","surface_form":"clarinet","offset":582},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melody","offset":599},{"uri":"Igor_Stravinsky","surface_form":"Igor Stravinsky","offset":822},{"uri":"Darius_Milhaud","surface_form":"Darius Milhaud","offset":839},{"uri":"B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k","surface_form":"B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k","offset":855},{"uri":"Charles_Ives","surface_form":"Charles Ives","offset":868}]}
