{"id":685317,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales","text":"The long and short scales are two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers of ten that use the same words with different meanings. The long scale is based on powers of one million (1,000,000), whereas the short scale is based on powers of one thousand (1,000).\nFor whole numbers less than a thousand million (< 109), the two scales are the same. From a thousand million up (\u2265 109), the two scales differ ever more, using the same words for different numbers, which can cause misunderstanding.\nShort scale.\n\"billion\" (109) means \"a thousand million\",\n\"trillion\" (1012) means a \"thousand\u00A0billion\",\n\"quadrillion\" (1015) means a \"thousand trillion\", and so on. Thus, a short \"n\"-illion equals 103\"n\"\u2009+\u20093.\nLong scale.\n\"billion\" (1012) means a \"million million\",\n\"trillion\" (1018) means a \"million billion\",\n\"quadrillion\" (1024) means a \"million trillion\" and so on. Thus, a long \"n\"-illion equals 106\"n\".\nUse.\nCountries where the long scale is currently used include most countries in continental Europe and most that are French-speaking, Spanish-speaking (except Spanish-speakers born into an English-speaking culture, e.g. Puerto Rico, because of its influence from English-speaking United States) and Portuguese-speaking countries, except Brazil.\nThe short scale is now used in most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, in Brazil, in the former Soviet Union and several other countries.\nNumber names are rendered in the language of the country, but are similar everywhere due to shared etymology. Some languages, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, have large-number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales, as for example the Indian numbering system.\nFor most of the 19th and 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely used the long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so that the two systems were often referred to as \"British\" and \"American\" in the English language. After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short scale, in 1974 the government of the UK adopted it, and it is used for all official purposes. With very few exceptions, the British usage and American usage are now the same.\nThe first recorded use of the words \"short scale\" () and \"long scale\" () was by the French mathematician Genevi\u00E8ve Guitel in 1975.\nTo lessen the confusion from the use of both short and long terms in any language, the SI recommends using the Metric prefix, which keeps the same meaning regardless of the country and the language. Long and short scales remain in use for counting money.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Powers_of_10","surface_form":"powers of ten","offset":85},{"uri":"1%2C000%2C000%2C000","surface_form":"billion","offset":524},{"uri":"Trillion","surface_form":"trillion","offset":568},{"uri":"Quadrillion","surface_form":"quadrillion","offset":614},{"uri":"Billion","surface_form":"billion","offset":731},{"uri":"Trillion","surface_form":"trillion","offset":775},{"uri":"Quadrillion","surface_form":"quadrillion","offset":820},{"uri":"Continental_Europe","surface_form":"continental Europe","offset":997},{"uri":"Francophone","surface_form":"French-speaking","offset":1034},{"uri":"Hispanophone","surface_form":"Spanish-speaking","offset":1051},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":1137},{"uri":"Lusophone","surface_form":"Portuguese-speaking countries","offset":1216},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1254},{"uri":"English-speaking_world","surface_form":"English-speaking","offset":1298},{"uri":"List_of_countries_where_Arabic_is_an_official_language","surface_form":"Arabic-speaking countries","offset":1319},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1349},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":1371},{"uri":"Etymology","surface_form":"etymology","offset":1512},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":1555},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":1569},{"uri":"Indian_numbering_system","surface_form":"Indian numbering system","offset":1689},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1759},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1815},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":1933},{"uri":"Genevi%C3%A8ve_Guitel","surface_form":"Genevi\u00E8ve Guitel","offset":2303},{"uri":"Metric_prefix","surface_form":"Metric prefix","offset":2440}]}
