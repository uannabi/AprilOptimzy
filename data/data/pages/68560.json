{"id":68560,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version","text":"e=\"preserve\">A cover version (or simply \"cover\") is a song which is re-recorded by a singer or band, after another artist has released a recording of it. Sometimes the versions are similar, but sometimes they are very different.\nMany songs become more popular as cover versions than in their original recordings. Paul Revere and the Raiders recorded two songs, \"Louie, Louie\" and \"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\", that were bigger hits for other bands (The Kingsmen and The Monkees, respectively) than their versions.\nA few songs are covered so many times by different artists, that the songs become standards. \"Without You\" (written by Peter Ham and Tom Evans of the band Badfinger) was first covered by Harry Nilsson, then later by dozens of other singers, including Mariah Carey. \"Yesterday\" and \"Something\", written by Paul McCartney and George Harrison of The Beatles (respectively), are also standards.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":54},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":85},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":95},{"uri":"Paul_Revere_and_the_Raiders","surface_form":"Paul Revere and the Raiders","offset":313},{"uri":"The_Kingsmen","surface_form":"The Kingsmen","offset":452},{"uri":"The_Monkees","surface_form":"The Monkees","offset":469},{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":599},{"uri":"Without_You","surface_form":"Without You","offset":611},{"uri":"Peter_Ham","surface_form":"Peter Ham","offset":636},{"uri":"Tom_Evans","surface_form":"Tom Evans","offset":650},{"uri":"Badfinger","surface_form":"Badfinger","offset":672},{"uri":"Harry_Nilsson","surface_form":"Harry Nilsson","offset":704},{"uri":"Mariah_Carey","surface_form":"Mariah Carey","offset":768},{"uri":"Paul_McCartney","surface_form":"Paul McCartney","offset":822},{"uri":"George_Harrison","surface_form":"George Harrison","offset":841},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":860}]}
