{"id":68561,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingsmen","text":"The Kingsmen were a popular American band of the early 1960s. Their most famous hit was \"Louie, Louie\". Many people believed the song contained obscenity or suggestive lyrics, and tried to have the song banned. An American court decided the song was not obscene, and the controversy over the song only helped to promote sales of the record.\nThe Kingsmen had other hits, including \"Jolly Green Giant\", a parody of the mascot of Green Giant vegetables. They appeared in a movie, \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\", accompanying Annette Funicello onstage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":28},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":37},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":55},{"uri":"Obscenity","surface_form":"obscenity","offset":144},{"uri":"Euphemism","surface_form":"suggestive","offset":157},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversy","offset":271},{"uri":"Promotion","surface_form":"promote","offset":312},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parody","offset":403},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":417},{"uri":"Annette_Funicello","surface_form":"Annette Funicello","offset":520}]}
