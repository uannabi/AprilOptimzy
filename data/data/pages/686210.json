{"id":686210,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-watchman_state","text":"e=\"preserve\">A night-watchman state is part of libertarian philosophy. Those who believe in a night-watchman state are called \"minarchists\" and they believe in minarchism. This view believes a government's only function is to protect the rights of its citizens.\nOverview.\nThe military, police, and court system are provided to protect citizens, while the free markets handle everything else. Minarchists believe that the most efficient way of providing products and services is through the use of free markets. This is the belief of free market capitalism or laissez-faire capitalism.\nCitizens should be protected from aggression, theft, broken contracts and fraud. Also property laws, specifically private property laws need to be enforced.\nAyn Rand, Robert Nozick, and Austin Petersen, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig Von Mises, and Frederic Bastiat are well known for adopting minarchism as a part of their beliefs.\nThis idea of a night-watchman state is related to libertarianism. It is especially relevant to the USA, and rarely used in other contexts. However, it has its origin in the social history of 19th century Great Britain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Libertarianism","surface_form":"libertarian","offset":47},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":59},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government's","offset":193},{"uri":"Citizens","surface_form":"citizens","offset":252},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":276},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":286},{"uri":"Court","surface_form":"court","offset":298},{"uri":"Protection","surface_form":"protect","offset":327},{"uri":"Product_(business)","surface_form":"products","offset":453},{"uri":"Service_(economics)","surface_form":"services","offset":466},{"uri":"Free_market","surface_form":"free markets","offset":497},{"uri":"Capitalism","surface_form":"capitalism","offset":545},{"uri":"Laissez-faire","surface_form":"laissez-faire","offset":559},{"uri":"Aggression","surface_form":"aggression","offset":619},{"uri":"Theft","surface_form":"theft","offset":631},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":645},{"uri":"Fraud","surface_form":"fraud","offset":659},{"uri":"Property_law","surface_form":"property law","offset":671},{"uri":"Ayn_Rand","surface_form":"Ayn Rand","offset":742},{"uri":"Robert_Nozick","surface_form":"Robert Nozick","offset":752},{"uri":"Austin_Petersen","surface_form":"Austin Petersen","offset":771},{"uri":"Ron_Paul","surface_form":"Ron Paul","offset":788},{"uri":"Rand_Paul","surface_form":"Rand Paul","offset":798},{"uri":"Friedrich_Hayek","surface_form":"Friedrich Hayek","offset":809},{"uri":"Ludwig_von_Mises","surface_form":"Ludwig Von Mises","offset":826},{"uri":"Frederic_Bastiat","surface_form":"Frederic Bastiat","offset":848},{"uri":"Libertarianism","surface_form":"libertarianism","offset":982},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":1031},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":1136}]}
