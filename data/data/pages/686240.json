{"id":686240,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunia","text":"Bunia is a city in the Ituri Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the capital of Ituri province. It was part of the Orientale Province until that province was split up into smaller provinces in 2015. As of 2012 it had an estimated population of 366,126.\nIt lies at an elevation of 1275\u00A0m on a plateau about 30\u00A0km west of Lake Albert in the Albertine Rift, and about 25\u00A0km east of the Ituri Forest.\nThe city is at the center of the Ituri conflict between the Lendu and Hema. In the Second Congo War the city and district were the scene of much fighting and many civilian deaths from this conflict, and related clashes between militias and Uganda-based forces. Consequently, the city is the base of one of the largest United Nations peace-keeping forces in Africa, and its headquarters in northeastern DRC. The area's natural resources include gold mines over which militias and foreign forces have been fighting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ituri_Province","surface_form":"Ituri Province","offset":23},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":45},{"uri":"Ituri_Province","surface_form":"Ituri","offset":103},{"uri":"Orientale_Province","surface_form":"Orientale Province","offset":138},{"uri":"Lake_Albert_(Africa)","surface_form":"Lake Albert","offset":343},{"uri":"Albertine_Rift","surface_form":"Albertine Rift","offset":362},{"uri":"Ituri_Forest","surface_form":"Ituri Forest","offset":406},{"uri":"Ituri_conflict","surface_form":"Ituri conflict","offset":453},{"uri":"Lendu","surface_form":"Lendu","offset":480},{"uri":"Hema_people","surface_form":"Hema","offset":490},{"uri":"Second_Congo_War","surface_form":"Second Congo War","offset":503},{"uri":"Militia","surface_form":"militia","offset":647},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":660},{"uri":"MONUC","surface_form":"United Nations peace-keeping forces","offset":738},{"uri":"Gold_mine","surface_form":"gold mine","offset":864}]}
