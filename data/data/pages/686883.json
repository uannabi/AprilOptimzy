{"id":686883,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Pilecki","text":"Witold Pilecki (13 May 1901 \u2013 25 May 1948) was a Polish resistance leader against Nazi Germany during World War II. He was also a spy, and cavalry officer. He was a captain in the Polish Army during World War II and the Polish-Soviet War. He was also one of the creators of the Secret Polish Army, which was a resistance group in German-occupied Poland. He was the writer of Witold's Report, the first spy report on Auschwitz, a German concentration camp, and the Holocaust. His religion was Roman Catholic, a Christian group.\nDuring World War II, Pilecki signed up to be jailed in Auschwitz, a German concentration camp, to tell the Allies about what is inside, and then escape. While inside the camp, he created a rebellion and told the Allies about the terrible things happening in Auschwitz as early as 1941. He escaped from the camp in 1943. He was a soldier in the Warsaw Uprising, which was an attack to free Warsaw from Nazi Germany. He was arrested in 1947 by Soviet secret police, and killed by them in 1948. Knowledge of the killing was kept secret until 1989, when Poland revealed his death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish","offset":49},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":82},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":102},{"uri":"Cavalry","surface_form":"cavalry","offset":139},{"uri":"Polish-Soviet_War","surface_form":"Polish-Soviet War","offset":220},{"uri":"Secret_Polish_Army","surface_form":"Secret Polish Army","offset":278},{"uri":"Witold%27s_Report","surface_form":"Witold's Report","offset":375},{"uri":"Auschwitz","surface_form":"Auschwitz","offset":416},{"uri":"Concentration_camp","surface_form":"concentration camp","offset":436},{"uri":"Holocaust","surface_form":"Holocaust","offset":464},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":492},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allies","offset":634},{"uri":"Warsaw_Uprising","surface_form":"Warsaw Uprising","offset":871},{"uri":"Warsaw","surface_form":"Warsaw","offset":916},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrested","offset":949},{"uri":"Soviet","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":969},{"uri":"Knowledge","surface_form":"Knowledge","offset":1019}]}
