{"id":68696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan","text":"Trajan (Marcus Ulpius Nerva Traianus, 18 September 53 \u2013 9 August 117) was Roman Emperor from 98 to 117. Born into a non-patrician family in the province of Hispania Baetica, Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor Domitian.\nServing as a general in the Roman army along the German frontier, Trajan successfully put down the revolt of Antonius Saturninus in 89.\nIn September 96, Domitian was succeeded by Nerva, an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power, a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard compelled him to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. Nerva died on 27 January 98, and was succeeded by Trajan without incident.\nTrajan as Emperor.\nAs a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program which reshaped the city of Rome and left multiple enduring landmarks such as Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column.\nEarly in his reign he annexed Nabataea (between the Arabian and Sinai peninsulas), creating the province of Arabia Petraea. His conquest of Dacia enriched the empire greatly - the new province possessed many valuable gold mines. His war against the Parthian Empire ended with the sack of its capital Ctesiphon and the annexation of Armenia and Mesopotamia. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent.\nIn late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in the city of Selinus. He was deified by the Senate, and succeeded by his adopted son Hadrian.\nAs an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured\u00A0\u2014 he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries. Every new emperor after him was honoured by the Senate with the prayer \"felicior Augusto, melior Traiano\", meaning \"may he be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan\". Among medieval Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a \"virtuous pagan\", while the 18th century historian Edward Gibbon popularized the notion of the Five Good Emperors, of which Trajan was the second.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Roman Emperor","offset":74},{"uri":"Patrician","surface_form":"patrician","offset":120},{"uri":"Hispania","surface_form":"Hispania","offset":156},{"uri":"Domitian","surface_form":"Domitian","offset":228},{"uri":"Roman_army","surface_form":"Roman army","offset":266},{"uri":"Germanic_peoples","surface_form":"German","offset":287},{"uri":"Lucius_Antonius_Saturninus","surface_form":"Antonius Saturninus","offset":347},{"uri":"Nerva","surface_form":"Nerva","offset":417},{"uri":"Praetorian_Guard","surface_form":"Praetorian Guard","offset":566},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":870},{"uri":"Trajan%27s_Forum","surface_form":"Trajan's Forum","offset":920},{"uri":"Trajan%27s_Market","surface_form":"Trajan's Market","offset":936},{"uri":"Trajan%27s_Column","surface_form":"Trajan's Column","offset":956},{"uri":"Nabataea","surface_form":"Nabataea","offset":1003},{"uri":"Arabia","surface_form":"Arabia","offset":1025},{"uri":"Sinai","surface_form":"Sinai","offset":1037},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":1043},{"uri":"Roman_Dacia","surface_form":"Dacia","offset":1113},{"uri":"Parthia","surface_form":"Parthian Empire","offset":1222},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":1305},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Mesopotamia","offset":1317},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":1477},{"uri":"Selinus","surface_form":"Selinus","offset":1499},{"uri":"Deified","surface_form":"deified","offset":1515},{"uri":"Hadrian","surface_form":"Hadrian","offset":1571},{"uri":"Augustus","surface_form":"Augustus","offset":1846},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"medieval","offset":1886},{"uri":"Pagan","surface_form":"pagan","offset":1952},{"uri":"Edward_Gibbon","surface_form":"Edward Gibbon","offset":1993},{"uri":"Five_Good_Emperors","surface_form":"Five Good Emperors","offset":2037}]}
