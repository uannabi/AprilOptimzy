She was known for battling ovarian cancer throughout her modeling career. She was photographed with surgical scars and a bald head from chemotherapy.\nIn 2013, she was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer only seen in elderly women. She was originally called a plus-size model by industry standards, a label which she rejected, saying that she embraced her size 14 body, and was normal size.\nShe was on the front a campaign for the \"Australian Women's Weekly\" and was one of six models featured in plus-size lingerie company Lane Bryant's #ImNoAngel campaign in April 2015. Her unretouched surgery scars were visible in the photographs.\nMayday died from the disease on March 1, 2019 at a hospital in Vancouver, aged 30.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Model_(person)","surface_form":"model","offset":101},{"uri":"Activist","surface_form":"activist","offset":111},{"uri":"Ovarian_cancer","surface_form":"ovarian cancer","offset":167},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":276},{"uri":"Plus-size_model","surface_form":"plus-size model","offset":408},{"uri":"Clothing_size","surface_form":"size","offset":504},{"uri":"Australian_Women%27s_Weekly","surface_form":"Australian Women's Weekly","offset":580},{"uri":"Lane_Bryant","surface_form":"Lane Bryant","offset":672},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":847}]}
