{"id":68729,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppland","text":"Uppland is a historical province or \"landskap\" on the eastern coast of Sweden, just north of Stockholm, the capital. It borders S\u00F6dermanland, V\u00E4stmanland and G\u00E4strikland. It is also bounded by lake M\u00E4laren and the Baltic sea. It has an extremely short and strangely shaped land border with \u00C5land, an autonomous province of Finland, on the small uninhabited island of M\u00E4rket in the Baltic.\nThe name literally means \"up land\", a name which is commonly encountered in especially older English literature. Its Latinised form, which is occasionally used, is \"Uplandia\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Provinces_of_Sweden","surface_form":"province","offset":24},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":71},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":93},{"uri":"S%C3%B6dermanland","surface_form":"S\u00F6dermanland","offset":128},{"uri":"V%C3%A4stmanland","surface_form":"V\u00E4stmanland","offset":142},{"uri":"G%C3%A4strikland","surface_form":"G\u00E4strikland","offset":158},{"uri":"M%C3%A4laren","surface_form":"M\u00E4laren","offset":198},{"uri":"Baltic_sea","surface_form":"Baltic sea","offset":214},{"uri":"%C3%85land","surface_form":"\u00C5land","offset":290},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":323},{"uri":"M%C3%A4rket","surface_form":"M\u00E4rket","offset":367}]}
