{"id":687407,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_Stadium","text":"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is a stadium that serves as the home ground for Tottenham Hotspur in north London, replacing the club's previous stadium, White Hart Lane. It has a capacity of 62,062, making it one of the largest stadiums in the Premier League and the largest club stadium in London. It is designed to be a multi-purpose stadium and features the world's first dividing, retractable football pitch, which reveals a synthetic turf pitch underneath for NFL London Games, concerts and other events.\n\"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\" is unlikely to remain the official stadium name indefinitely, it is widely expected that the rights to the naming of the stadium will be sold. The stadium is occasionally referred to as New White Hart Lane by fans and some in the media.\nTransport.\nThe stadium is accessible through a number of London Overground, London Underground and National Rail stations: Seven Sisters, Tottenham Hale, Northumberland Park, and White Hart Lane stations. The nearest station, at around 200 m away, is White Hart Lane (London Overground), which is being rebuilt, and a Wembley-style walkway for fans from the station to the stadium is planned. The stadium area is also served by up to 144 buses an hour. Bus routes that stop close to the ground are 149, 259, 279, 349, and W3. The club will also operate two high frequency shuttle bus services to the stadium, one from Alexandra Palace through Wood Green, and the other from Tottenham Hale.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.","surface_form":"Tottenham Hotspur","offset":74},{"uri":"White_Hart_Lane","surface_form":"White Hart Lane","offset":148},{"uri":"List_of_English_football_stadiums_by_capacity","surface_form":"largest","offset":215},{"uri":"English_Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":239},{"uri":"London_Overground","surface_form":"London Overground","offset":827},{"uri":"London_Underground","surface_form":"London Underground","offset":846},{"uri":"National_Rail","surface_form":"National Rail","offset":869},{"uri":"Seven_Sisters_station","surface_form":"Seven Sisters","offset":893},{"uri":"Tottenham_Hale_station","surface_form":"Tottenham Hale","offset":908},{"uri":"Northumberland_Park_railway_station","surface_form":"Northumberland Park","offset":924},{"uri":"White_Hart_Lane_railway_station","surface_form":"White Hart Lane","offset":949},{"uri":"London_Buses_route_149","surface_form":"149","offset":1268},{"uri":"London_Buses_route_259","surface_form":"259","offset":1273},{"uri":"London_Buses_route_279","surface_form":"279","offset":1278},{"uri":"London_Buses_route_349","surface_form":"349","offset":1283},{"uri":"London_Buses_route_W3","surface_form":"W3","offset":1292},{"uri":"Alexandra_Palace_railway_station","surface_form":"Alexandra Palace","offset":1388},{"uri":"Wood_Green_tube_station","surface_form":"Wood Green","offset":1413}]}
