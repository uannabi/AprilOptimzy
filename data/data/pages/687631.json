{"id":687631,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl","text":"e=\"preserve\">In vector calculus, the curl is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal rotation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. At every point in the field, the curl of that point is represented by a vector.\nGiven a vector field formula_1, the curl of formula_1 can be written as formula_1 or formula_1, where formula_1 is the gradient and formula_1 is the cross product operation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vector_calculus","surface_form":"vector calculus","offset":16},{"uri":"Vector_field","surface_form":"vector field","offset":110},{"uri":"Euclidean_space","surface_form":"Euclidean space","offset":144},{"uri":"Gradient","surface_form":"gradient","offset":360},{"uri":"Cross_product","surface_form":"cross product","offset":390}]}
