{"id":68764,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Chantal_(2007)","text":"Tropical Storm Chantal was a very short-lived storm in the northern Atlantic Ocean that stayed away from land during most of its existence. It was also the third named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. The stormed formed from a non-tropical system between Bermuda on Cape Cod, Massachusetts that developed on July 31 with good conditions for further development. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50\u00A0mph (80\u00A0km/h) and began to move quickly northeastwards into colder water temperatures. When convection began to decrease, the National Hurricane Center stopped sending out advisories on August 1 when Chantal began to turn into an extratropical cyclone. Later, the remnants moved over southeast Newfoundland, before moving into the Arctic Ocean.\nStorm history.\nAn area of thunderstorm activity developed on July 28 about 100\u00A0miles (160\u00A0km) east of the Bahamas which was associated with a weak low pressure system. It moved north-northeastward, into poor environmental conditions which left the system disorganized. However, conditions then were forecasted to become better for development, and by July 29 the National Hurricane Center stated that it had \"potential for tropical or subtropical development.\" On July 30, the low passed to the west of Bermuda as it continued moving northeastward, under the effects of a large mid-latitude trough. The system contained an exposed low-level circulation, which from time to time passed under a thick area of convection to its northeast. By early on July 31, ship reports and QuikSCAT observations detected winds of 35\u00A0mph (55\u00A0km/h), and the center was well-involved enough with the convection for the National Hurricane Center to name it as \"Tropical Depression Three\" while it was located about 270\u00A0miles (435\u00A0km) north-northwest of Bermuda, or about 445\u00A0miles (710\u00A0km) south-southeast of Chatham, Massachusetts.\nBy six hours after development, the depression had of a somewhat exposed low-level center with deep convection taking up most of the northeastern semicircle. Located over sea surface temperatures of about 80\u00BA\u00A0F (27\u00BA\u00A0C), one forecaster said the depression had \"a small window of opportunity... for it to reach tropical storm strength before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone.\" The system organized further, and based on satellite pictures and QuikSCAT data, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chantal at 1215\u00A0UTC on July 31 while located about 330\u00A0miles (530\u00A0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. By three hours later the system formed a well-defined curved banding features, and Chantal reached maximum systained winds of 50\u00A0mph (80\u00A0km/h) at 40.2\u00BA\u00A0N. The storm speed up northeastward into an area of cold waters and cooler air, and early on August 1 the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on Chantal as it began extratropical transition.\nAfter becoming an extratropical cyclone, Chantal managed to keep scattered convection near its center, though its main area of convection and clouds moved to its north. On August 1, the cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, and by late in the day the extratropical remnants of Chantal were about 265\u00A0miles (425\u00A0km) northeast of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and moving northeastward at 44\u00A0mph (70\u00A0km/h).\nImpact.\nThe weather system that would later become Chantal began to affect Bermuda on July 30. It caused some thunderstorms. The next day, it caused heavy rainfall that reached r2.12\u00A0inches (53.8\u00A0mm) at the Bermuda International Airport. Winds on the island reached 45\u00A0mph (72\u00A0km/h) because of the weather system. After Chantal passed Bermuda, a ship with the call sign of \"C60Y4\" recorded winds of 37\u00A0mph (59\u00A0km/h).\nShortly after the system became a tropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center of Canada sent out gale warnings for the waters off of Newfoundland. The Newfoundland Labrador Weather Office also issued warnings for heavy rain.\nIn the open ocean, waves from Chantal reached 20\u00A0feet (6\u00A0m) high. The storm also had effects on land. A wind gust of 54\u00A0mph (88\u00A0km/h) was reported. What was left of Chantal caused heavy rainfall in a short time in Newfoundland. In the province, rainfall peaked at 5.9\u00A0inches (150\u00A0mm) at Whitbourne. The rainfall caused flooding and also caused streets to wash out in several cities on the Avalon Peninsula. Several towns declared states of emergencies along the Avalon Peninsula.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Hurricane"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":68},{"uri":"2007_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2007 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":181},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":267},{"uri":"Cape_Cod","surface_form":"Cape Cod","offset":278},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":288},{"uri":"Convection","surface_form":"convection","offset":510},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":544},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":648},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":712},{"uri":"Arctic_Ocean","surface_form":"Arctic Ocean","offset":749},{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"thunderstorm","offset":789},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":869},{"uri":"Low_pressure_area","surface_form":"low pressure system","offset":910},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":1126},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical","offset":1186},{"uri":"Subtropical_cyclone","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":1198},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":1266},{"uri":"Trough_(meteorology)","surface_form":"trough","offset":1354},{"uri":"Convection","surface_form":"convection","offset":1470},{"uri":"QuikSCAT","surface_form":"QuikSCAT","offset":1537},{"uri":"Chatham%2C_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Chatham, Massachusetts","offset":1852},{"uri":"Sea_surface_temperature","surface_form":"sea surface temperature","offset":2047},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"F","offset":2085},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"C","offset":2092},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":2236},{"uri":"UTC","surface_form":"UTC","offset":2429},{"uri":"Halifax_Regional_Municipality","surface_form":"Halifax","offset":2492},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":2501},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"banding features","offset":2575},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"N","offset":2666},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":2892},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":3085},{"uri":"Avalon_Peninsula","surface_form":"Avalon Peninsula","offset":3108},{"uri":"St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador","offset":3230},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":3389},{"uri":"Bermuda_International_Airport","surface_form":"Bermuda International Airport","offset":3521},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":3821},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":3873},{"uri":"Whitbourne%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"Whitbourne","offset":4252},{"uri":"Avalon_Peninsula","surface_form":"Avalon Peninsula","offset":4354},{"uri":"Avalon_Peninsula","surface_form":"Avalon Peninsula","offset":4427}]}
