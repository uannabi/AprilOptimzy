{"id":688204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cellophane is a bioplastic wrapping material. It is a thin, transparent sheet made of cellulose. It has low permeability. That means very little air, oils, greases, bacteria, and water can get in. That makes it useful for food packaging.\nCellophane was invented by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger.\nIt took ten years for Brandenberger to perfect his idea. He added glycerin to soften the material. By 1912 he had built a machine to make the film. He called the product \"Cellophane\", from the words \"cellulose\" and \"diaphane\" (\"transparent\"). Cellophane was patented that year.\nDuPont built the first cellophane manufacturing plant in the US. One of their chemists found a way to make it moisture proof. The material became hugely popular.\n\"Cellophane\" is a general term in some countries, but in other countries it is a registered trademark.\nCellophane played a crucial role in developing the self-service retailing of fresh meat. The transparency helped customers see the quality of meat before buying. Cellophane also largely prevents discoloration of food.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":32},{"uri":"Transparent","surface_form":"transparent","offset":73},{"uri":"Cellulose","surface_form":"cellulose","offset":99},{"uri":"Permeability","surface_form":"permeability","offset":121},{"uri":"Air","surface_form":"air","offset":158},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":163},{"uri":"Grease","surface_form":"grease","offset":169},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":178},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":192},{"uri":"Packaging","surface_form":"packaging","offset":240},{"uri":"Swiss","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":278},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":284},{"uri":"Jacques_E._Brandenberger","surface_form":"Jacques E.
