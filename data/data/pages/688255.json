{"id":688255,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)","text":"The Basque Autonomous Community (, EAE;, CAV) is an autonomous community in northern Spain. It has the Basque provinces of \u00C1lava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa. It is also called the \"Basque Country.\"\nThe Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community was called a \"nationality\" in Spain by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Navarre decided not to be part of the Basque Country. Instead, it became a different autonomous community.\nThere is no capital in the autonomous community right now, but the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, in \u00C1lava, has the Basque Parliament, the Basque Government, and the house of the President of the Basque Autonomous Community (the Palace of Ajuria Enea). The High Court of Justice of the Basque Country is in Bilbao. Vitoria-Gasteiz is the city with the most land, with 277\u00A0km2 (107 sq mi), Bilbao has the most people, with 353,187.\nPeople also say \"Basque Country\" when they talk about the larger cultural region (Basque: \"Euskal Herria\"), the home of the Basque people, which has the autonomous community in it.\nAtlantic Basin.\nThe Atlantic Basin has many valleys with short rivers that flow from the mountains to the Bay of Biscay, like the Nervi\u00F3n, Urola, and Oria.\nThe coast is rough, with high cliffs. The main parts of the coast are the Bilbao Abra Bay and the Estuary of Bilbao, the Urdaibai estuary and the Bidasoa-Txingudi Bay that makes the border with France.\nMiddle.\nBetween the two mountain ranges, there is a high plateau called \"Llanada Alavesa\" (the \u00C1lava Plains), where the capital Vitoria-Gasteiz. The rivers flow south from the mountains to the Ebro River. The main rivers are the Zadorra River and Bayas River.\nEbro Valley.\nThe Ebro is a river in that starts in Cantabria and flows through the southern part of the Basque Autonomous Community. This makes an area called the Ebro Valley. The Ebro Valley is well-known for famous wine.\nClimate.\nThe northern valleys in Biscay and Gipuzkoa and the valley of Ayala in \u00C1lava are part of Green Spain, where there is a lot of rain.\nThe climate in the middle part is more like the middle of Spain. This gives warm, dry summers and cold, snowy winters.\nThe Ebro Valley's climate is just like the middle part of Spain: winters are cold and dry and summers very warm and dry, and it rains the most in spring and autumn. Overall, it does not rain very much in this part of the autonomous community.\nDemographics.\nAlmost half of the 2,155,546 people in the Basque Autonomous Community live in Greater Bilbao, the area around the city of Bilbao. Of the ten biggest cities, six are part of Bilbao's conurbation (Bilbao, Barakaldo, Getxo, Portugalete, Santurtzi and Basauri). This is also called Greater Bilbao.\nBecause 28.2% of the Basque population is born outside the autonomous community, immigration is important for Basque demographics. Since the year 1900, most of these people have come from other parts of spain, like Galicia or Castile and Le\u00F3n. Recently, many of these people have gone back to the places they were born. Now, immigration comes from other countries, mostly in South America.\nRoman Catholicism is, by far, the biggest religion in the Basque Country. In 2012, 58.6% of Basques called themselves as Roman Catholic but many people do not believe in religion: 24.6% were non-religious and 12.3% of Basques were atheist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Autonomous_communities_of_Spain","surface_form":"autonomous community","offset":52},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":85},{"uri":"%C3%81lava","surface_form":"\u00C1lava","offset":123},{"uri":"Biscay","surface_form":"Biscay","offset":130},{"uri":"Gipuzkoa","surface_form":"Gipuzkoa","offset":142},{"uri":"Nationalities_and_regions_of_Spain","surface_form":"nationality","offset":256},{"uri":"Spanish_Constitution_of_1978","surface_form":"Spanish Constitution of 1978","offset":285},{"uri":"Navarre","surface_form":"Navarre","offset":315},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":434},{"uri":"Vitoria-Gasteiz","surface_form":"Vitoria-Gasteiz","offset":497},{"uri":"Basque_Parliament","surface_form":"Basque Parliament","offset":532},{"uri":"Basque_Government","surface_form":"Basque Government","offset":555},{"uri":"Ajuria_Enea","surface_form":"Palace of Ajuria Enea","offset":645},{"uri":"High_Courts_of_Justice_of_Spain","surface_form":"High Court of Justice of the Basque Country","offset":673},{"uri":"Bilbao","surface_form":"Bilbao","offset":723},{"uri":"Basque_Country_(greater_region)","surface_form":"larger cultural region","offset":905},{"uri":"Bay_of_Biscay","surface_form":"Bay of Biscay","offset":1134},{"uri":"Nervi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Nervi\u00F3n","offset":1158},{"uri":"Urola","surface_form":"Urola","offset":1167},{"uri":"Oria_(river)","surface_form":"Oria","offset":1178},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliffs","offset":1214},{"uri":"Bilbao_Abra","surface_form":"Bilbao Abra","offset":1258},{"uri":"Estuary_of_Bilbao","surface_form":"Estuary of Bilbao","offset":1282},{"uri":"Urdaibai","surface_form":"Urdaibai","offset":1305},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":1314},{"uri":"Bidasoa-Txingudi","surface_form":"Bidasoa-Txingudi","offset":1330},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":1443},{"uri":"%C3%81lava","surface_form":"\u00C1lava","offset":1481},{"uri":"Zadorra_River","surface_form":"Zadorra River","offset":1615},{"uri":"Bayas_River","surface_form":"Bayas River","offset":1633},{"uri":"Ebro","surface_form":"Ebro","offset":1663},{"uri":"Cantabria","surface_form":"Cantabria","offset":1697},{"uri":"Ebro_Valley","surface_form":"Ebro Valley","offset":1809},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":1863},{"uri":"Green_Spain","surface_form":"Green Spain","offset":1967},{"uri":"Greater_Bilbao","surface_form":"Greater Bilbao","offset":2465},{"uri":"Bilbao","surface_form":"Bilbao","offset":2509},{"uri":"Conurbation","surface_form":"conurbation","offset":2569},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":2762},{"uri":"Galicia_(Spain)","surface_form":"Galicia","offset":2896},{"uri":"Castile_and_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Castile and Le\u00F3n","offset":2907},{"uri":"South_America.","surface_form":"South America.","offset":3056},{"uri":"Roman_Catholicism","surface_form":"Roman Catholicism","offset":3071},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":3113},{"uri":"Basques","surface_form":"Basques","offset":3163},{"uri":"Atheist","surface_form":"atheist","offset":3302}]}
