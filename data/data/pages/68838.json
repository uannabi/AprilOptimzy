{"id":68838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze","text":"\"Kamikaze\" (Japanese: \u795E\u98A8; literally: \"god-wind\"; usual translation: \"divine wind\") is a word of Japanese origin. It comes from the name the Japanese gave to a typhoon that destroyed the Mongol ships in the 13th century and saved the country from invasion. In Western culture, the word \"kamikaze\" is used to mean the suicide pilots of the Empire of Japan. Those pilots attacked the ships of the Allied Powers in the final years of World War II, during which they flew their planes into enemy ships. It has also come to mean other kinds of suicide attacks.\nMost people in Western culture believe the word \"kamikaze\" was the name used by the Japanese military for pilots, but that is not true. Their correct name was \"tokubetsu k\u014Dgeki tai\" (\u7279\u5225\u653B\u6483\u968A), which literally means \"special attack team.\" This is usually abbreviated \"tokk\u014Dtai\" (\u7279\u653B\u968A) in a shortened form. The suicide attacks made by Navy pilots were called \"shinp\u016B tokubetsu k\u014Dgeki tai\" (\u795E\u98A8\u7279\u5225\u653B\u6483\u968A, \"divine wind special attack team\"). The American translators used a different style of pronunciation of the Japanese language by mistake, and read the word \"shinp\u016B\" (\"divine wind\") as \"kamikaze\", as those Japanese characters can be read both ways. The name became well known so, after the war, the Japanese also started using it.\nHistory.\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Navy and its Air force were defeated in several important battles, like Midway and the Philippine Sea. They lost many ships (including nearly all the Japanese aircraft carriers), hundreds of fighter aircraft, and many of their best pilots. The Japanese industry was small and very poor compared to the American industry. For this reason, the United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly; but Japan could only make few, and of poor quality. During 1943-44, the Allied forces were moving towards Japan. At the Battle of the Philippine Sea, on June 19-20, 1944, the Japanese forces were pushed back to the Philippines.\nOn July 15, Saipan (in the Northern Mariana Islands) was captured by Allied forces. The capture of Saipan made it possible for the United States Army Air Force to attack Japan itself, using B-29 Superfortress bombers. After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese commanders knew that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines next. The Philippines were very important because they were located between the oil fields of Southeast Asia and Japan. If Japan lost control over the Philippines, they would have little fuel left for their ships. On October 17, the Allies started the attack on the Philippines in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\nVice Admiral Takijiro Onishi was in charge of the Japanese Air Force in Manila. He understood that it was impossible to win the battle with so few aircraft and trained pilots. For this reason, he decided to form a suicide attack force, the Special Attack Unit. A group of 24 student pilots volunteered for the mission. The Special Attack force was organized into 4 groups, \"Unit Shikishima\", \"Unit Yamato\", \"Unit Asahi\", and \"Unit Yamazakura\". These names were taken from a patriotic poem (\"waka\" or \"tanka\"), written by the Japanese classical poet, Motoori Norinaga: (\u6577\u5CF6\u306E \u5927\u548C\u5FC3\u3092 \u4EBA\u554F\u306F\u3070 \u671D\u65E5\u306B\u5302\u3046 \u5C71\u685C\u82B1). The poem reads: \"Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni niou yamazakura bana\"\nThe Japanese were defeated at the battle of Leyte Gulf, but the Special Attack force had great success. The first \"kamikaze\" attack took place on October 21, 1944, against the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy, HMAS \"Australia\". 30 sailors died in the attack, including its Captain Emile Dechaineux, and many more were wounded. By October 26, 47 more Allied ships had been attacked. Most of them were badly damaged or sunk, like the United States aircraft carrier USS \"St. Lo\".\nThis early success convinced the Japanese commanders to continue the \"kamikaze\" attacks. Many more pilots were recruited to act as \"kamikaze\". Over the next few months, more than 2,000 planes made such attacks. When the Japanese stock of airplanes began to run low, new models of low quality were built for these missions. Some of them, like the Nakajima Ki-115 \"Tsurugi\", were made mostly of wood and used stocks of older engines. The plane's landing gear was usually dropped by the pilot after takeoff so it could be used by other aircraft, because he would not be landing again. Similar suicide attack programs were planned, including rocket bombs with pilots (called \"Ohka\") and submarine torpedoes (\"Kaiten\").\nThe high point of \"kamikaze\" attacks came from April 6 to May 25, 1945 during the Battle of Okinawa, in \"Operation Kikusui\" (\"floating chrysanthemums\"). In that time, seven important waves of attacks took place, with more than 1,500 \"kamikaze\" planes. Because their training had been too short and their airplanes were poorly made, \"kamikaze\" pilots were easy targets for the experienced Allied pilots, who also had much better planes. But still, the \"kamikaze\" who escaped the anti-aircraft fire and the enemy fighter airplanes did great damage to the Allied fleet. The Allies won the battle, but they lost many ships and men because of \"kamikaze\" attacks. By the end of the battle, at least 21 American ships had been sunk by \"kamikazes\". Some ships from other Allied navies were also sunk, and dozens more were damaged.\nHundreds of extra \"kamikaze\" planes were ready to defend Japan from invasion. However, with Japan's surrender on August 15 after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the declaration of war by the Soviet Union, they were never used again.\nEffects.\nThe most important effect of the attacks was creating fear among the Allied troops. When the American ships went to the last battles, the crews were very afraid of \"kamikaze\" pilots. By the end of World War II, the Japanese Navy had sacrificed 2,525 \"kamikaze\" pilots, and the Air force had lost 1,387. The Japanese government said, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195. They also claimed that the \"kamikaze\" attacks were the cause of 80% of Allied deaths in the last years of the War.\nThe American sources claim that \"kamikaze\" sunk less ships than the Japanese say. But still, they agree that they did very important damage. According to a U.S. Air Force source, the \"kamikaze\" attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. In a 2010 book, the historian Robin Rielly said that about 60 U.S. ships were sunk by kamikazes, and over 400 were damaged by them.\nKamikaze beliefs.\nMany \"kamikaze\" pilots offered themselves as volunteers for the mission. They were usually very young, between 18 and 24 years old. Their belief was that dying when striking the enemies of Japan and the Emperor down was a very honorable death. This principle was traditional since the days of the samurai, and gave great importance to the sense of duty and obedience. This idea was called \"Giri\" (\"Obligation\"), and was part of the code of conduct of the Japanese warriors since the Middle Ages, the \"Bushido\". Many young men sacrificed themselves by their free will because these beliefs and their love for the home land were the most important things for them. The \"tokk\u014Dtai\" pilot's manual told pilots to never close their eyes. This was because if a pilot closed his eyes he would miss his target. In the final moments before the crash, the pilot was to shout \"Hissatsu!\" (\"Critical Strike!\") as loud as he could.\nA special ceremony before going to combat usually took place. Pilots drank sake and ate a ball of rice. They were given medals, and a katana sword. They put on a headband with the rising sun, and a \"sennibari\", a \"belt of a thousand stitches\" made by a thousand women, who made one stitch each. Many times, they took prayers written by their families with them. According to legend, young pilots on \"kamikaze\" missions many times flew southwest from Japan over the 922-metre (~3000\u00A0ft) Mount Kaimon. Suicide mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see this, and said farewell to their country. Another legend says that \"kamikaze\" pilots dropped flowers from the air, as they departed on their final missions. Some places, like the hills near Kikajima airport, are said to have beds of cornflower that bloom in early May from those days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":12},{"uri":"Literal_translation","surface_form":"literally","offset":26},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"god","offset":38},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translation","offset":55},{"uri":"Divinity","surface_form":"divine","offset":69},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":96},{"uri":"Typhoon","surface_form":"typhoon","offset":159},{"uri":"Mongol_Empire","surface_form":"Mongol","offset":186},{"uri":"Fleet_(ships)","surface_form":"ships","offset":193},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invasion","offset":246},{"uri":"Western_culture","surface_form":"Western
