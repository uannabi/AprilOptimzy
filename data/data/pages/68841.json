{"id":68841,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut","text":"The umlauts are a group of sounds in German. They are written \u00E4, \u00F6, \u00FC (or ae, oe, ue).\nWithout the diaeresis (the dots) those three letters are said [a], [o], and [u]. But when the dots are put over them, \u00C4, \u00D6, and \u00DC the sounds change to be said like [\u025B], [\u0153]/[\u00F8] and [y]/[\u028F].\nWhen a word that has umlaut letters with dots is changed into English, the letters are usually written as ae, oe, or ue instead of \u00E4, \u00F6, or \u00FC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":37},{"uri":"Diaeresis","surface_form":"diaeresis","offset":99},{"uri":"%C3%84","surface_form":"\u00C4","offset":205},{"uri":"%C3%96","surface_form":"\u00D6","offset":208},{"uri":"%C3%9C","surface_form":"\u00DC","offset":215},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":339}]}
