It can be replaced by using the letters Ae or ae. In English language newspapers it is often written as A or a but this is not correct. \u00C4 and \u00E4 are usually pronounced like the \"e\" in \"bed\".\nInternet addresses are written as \"ae\" because the internet address system can only understand ordinary English letters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":43},{"uri":"Umlaut_(diacritic)","surface_form":"umlaut","offset":121},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":130},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":139},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":151},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":209},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":511}]}
