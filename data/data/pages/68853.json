{"id":68853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey","text":"A bird of prey (also called raptor) is a bird that mainly uses its claws (called \"talons\") to seize prey. They are not classified into one natural family or group. They have strong sharp, hooked beaks and claws and have sharp eyesight. The behaviour evolved many times in different groups. This is an illustration of convergent evolution.\nDaytime birds.\nThose bird of prey that are active during the day (diurnal) are classified into five families in two orders. The orders are the Falconiformes and Accipitriformes.\nNighttime birds.\nNocturnal birds of prey \u2013 the owls \u2013 are classified separately, as members of two families of the order Strigiformes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":41},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":100},{"uri":"Evolved","surface_form":"evolved","offset":250},{"uri":"Convergent_evolution","surface_form":"convergent evolution","offset":317},{"uri":"Diurnal","surface_form":"diurnal","offset":405},{"uri":"Falconiformes","surface_form":"Falconiformes","offset":482},{"uri":"Accipitriformes","surface_form":"Accipitriformes","offset":500},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"Nocturnal","offset":534},{"uri":"Owl","surface_form":"owl","offset":564},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":616},{"uri":"Strigiformes","surface_form":"Strigiformes","offset":638}]}
