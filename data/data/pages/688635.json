{"id":688635,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_People%27s_Revolutionary_Party","text":"The Lao People's Revolutionary Party (), formerly the Lao People's Party, is a Marxist\u2013Leninist political party in Laos. It has emerged from the Communist Party of Vietnam founded by H\u1ED3 Ch\u00ED Minh in 1930. It has governed in Laos since 1975. The policy-making organs are the Politburo, Secretariat and the Central Committee. A party congress is held every five years. The congress elects members to the politburo and central committee. The congress used to also elect a secretariat, but this body was abolished in 1991. As of 2016, 128 of the 132 members of the National Assembly of Laos were from the Lao People's Revolutionary Party.\nHistory.\nThe party has its origins in the Communist Party of Indochina founded by Ho Chi Minh in 1930 (see Communist Party of Vietnam). The ICP was entirely Vietnamese at its beginning, but it grew throughout French Indochina. The Communist Party of Indochina was able to found a small \"Lao section\" in 1936. In the mid-1940s, a campaign to recruit Laotian members began. In 1946 or 1947, Kaysone Phomvihan, a law student at the University of Hanoi, was recruited, along with Nouhak Phoumsavan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marxism-Leninism","surface_form":"Marxist\u2013Leninist","offset":79},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":96},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":115},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Vietnam","surface_form":"Communist Party of Vietnam","offset":145},{"uri":"H%E1%BB%93_Ch%C3%AD_Minh","surface_form":"H\u1ED3 Ch\u00ED Minh","offset":183},{"uri":"Politburo_of_the_Lao_People%27s_Revolutionary_Party","surface_form":"Politburo","offset":273},{"uri":"Secretariat_of_the_Lao_People%27s_Revolutionary_Party","surface_form":"Secretariat","offset":284},{"uri":"Central_Committee_of_the_Lao_People%27s_Revolutionary_Party","surface_form":"Central Committee","offset":304},{"uri":"Party_congress","surface_form":"party congress","offset":325},{"uri":"National_Assembly_of_Laos","surface_form":"National Assembly of Laos","offset":560},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Indochina","surface_form":"Communist Party of Indochina","offset":676},{"uri":"Ho_Chi_Minh","surface_form":"Ho Chi Minh","offset":716},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Vietnam","surface_form":"Communist Party of Vietnam","offset":741},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":791},{"uri":"French_Indochina","surface_form":"French Indochina","offset":843},{"uri":"Kaysone_Phomvihan","surface_form":"Kaysone Phomvihan","offset":1023},{"uri":"University_of_Hanoi","surface_form":"University of Hanoi","offset":1063},{"uri":"Nouhak_Phoumsavan","surface_form":"Nouhak Phoumsavan","offset":1110}]}
