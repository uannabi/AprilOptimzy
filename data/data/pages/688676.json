{"id":688676,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_fig","text":"\"Ficus religiosa\" or sacred fig is a species of fig native to the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. It belongs to \"Moraceae\", the fig or mulberry family. It is also known as the bodhi tree, pippala tree, peepul tree, peepal tree or ashwattha tree (in India and Nepal).\nThe sacred fig is considered to have a religious significance in three major religions of the Indian subcontinent: Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. It is the type of tree under which Gautama Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. Hindu and Jain ascetics also consider the tree to be sacred and often meditate under them.\nIt begins life as an epiphyte, and eventually surrounds and outlives its host tree.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ficus","surface_form":"fig","offset":48},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":66},{"uri":"Indochina","surface_form":"Indochina","offset":90},{"uri":"Moraceae","surface_form":"Moraceae","offset":116},{"uri":"Indian_subcontinent","surface_form":"Indian subcontinent","offset":364},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":385},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":395},{"uri":"Jainism","surface_form":"Jainism","offset":408},{"uri":"Gautama_Buddha","surface_form":"Gautama Buddha","offset":452},{"uri":"Epiphyte","surface_form":"epiphyte","offset":623}]}
