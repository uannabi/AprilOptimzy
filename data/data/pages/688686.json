The following day, it was reported that the GNA has taken control of the prime ministerial offices and that the GNC appointed prime minister Khalifa al-Ghawil had fled to Misrata.\nPrior to his initial arrival in Tripoli in March 2016, Sarraj survived two separate assassination attempts.\nThe government's initial proposed group of ministers was rejected by the House of Representatives (HoR), leading Sarraj to form a government that received a no confidence vote from the HoR.
