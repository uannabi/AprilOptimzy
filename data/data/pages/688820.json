{"id":688820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerocole","text":"=\"preserve\">A xerocole (from Modern Greek x\u0113ros, meaning 'dry', and Latin col(ere), meaning 'to inhabit'), is an animal adapted to live in the desert. The main problems these animals face are very little water to drink, and a very hot environment. Xerocoles tend to be nocturnal or crepuscular to escape the heat.\nSaving up water.\nXerocoles have many ways to conserve (save up) the water in their body. Most xerocoles do not sweat, or sweat very little. Many desert birds and mammals have oils on their skin to prevent water from escaping. There is also very little water in their urine and feces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern Greek","offset":29},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":68},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adapted","offset":120},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":143},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":269},{"uri":"Crepuscular","surface_form":"crepuscular","offset":282},{"uri":"Sweat","surface_form":"sweat","offset":425},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammals","offset":476},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":581},{"uri":"Feces","surface_form":"feces","offset":591}]}
