They won the junior title at the United States national championships in 2006. In 2007, they won the bronze medal (third place) on the senior level, becoming the first team since Tanith Belbin & Benjamin Agosto to go from being junior national champions to World team members in one season.\nDavis and White have skated together since 1997. They are the longest-lasting team still skating in the United States.\nIn 2006, Davis and White won the bronze medal at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships. Later that year, they became the first team in the world to get the highest level of difficulty for one of their programs. This happened at the 2006 NHK Trophy and put them immediately into the skating spotlight.\nIn 2007, they won the bronze medal at Nationals. At the World Championships, they placed 7th. This was the highest placement for a US team at their first World Championships since 1980.\nDavis and White are coached by Igor Shpilband and Marina Zueva.\nWhite previously competed internationally as a single skater and nationally as a hockey player. He gave up hockey after breaking his ankle doing it and making him and Davis miss most of the 2004-2005 competitive season. He gave up single skating in 2006 to focus on ice dancing at the senior level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_dancer","surface_form":"ice dancer","offset":20},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":40},{"uri":"Meryl_Davis","surface_form":"Meryl Davis","offset":78},{"uri":"Tanith_Belbin","surface_form":"Tanith Belbin","offset":270},{"uri":"Benjamin_Agosto","surface_form":"Benjamin Agosto","offset":286},{"uri":"Igor_Shpilband","surface_form":"Igor Shpilband","offset":1027},{"uri":"Marina_Zueva","surface_form":"Marina Zueva","offset":1046}]}
