{"id":68919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie","text":"\"The Simpsons Movie\" is a 2007 American animated comedy movie. It is based on the television programme \"The Simpsons\". The movie is mainly about environmental disaster. The movie stars the main television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer.\nPlot.\nHomer adopts a pig, which he names Spider Pig, a parody of Spiderman. Lisa starts a campaign with a new boy named Colin, who is Irish. They want to stop the people of Springfield from dumping in the lake. Everyone agrees to this and the lake is cleared up. Marge questions Homer about Spider pigs 'leavings'. He says he has put them in a silo. This causes Marge to say \"Get rid of the silo properly.\" Homer agrees to this, and Marge says he is allowed to take Spider Pig with him. To which Homer tells Marge \"He's not Spider Pig anymore, he's Harry Plopper\". This is a reference to Harry Potter. The pig even has the lightning bolt scar and the thick glasses, just like Harry Potter. Homer drives to the waste site to get rid of the silo. Homer's friend and co-worker Lenny calls him from a donut store and tells him that they are giving out free donuts. Homer, with his love for donuts, tries to find a different way to getting rid of his silo. He then drives to the now clean lake. He ignores the \"No Dumping\" signs and dumps the silo into the lake. The lake then bubbles up and turns into a \"Toxic Nightmare\".\nCast.\nHomer adopts a pig, which he names Spider Pig, a parody of Spiderman.
