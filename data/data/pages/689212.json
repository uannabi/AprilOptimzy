{"id":689212,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty","text":"=\"preserve\">The Julio-Claudian dynasty was the first five Roman emperors at the start of the Roman Empire.\nThey were related to Julius Caesar (Dictator: murdered before becoming emperor).\nThe Roman society was a class society, and almost all ruling figures were from the Patrician class. Therefore, for the next 100 years the dynasty had many other influential members who were descended from the female members of the dynasty such as Julia the Younger, eldest granddaughter of Augustus. She was also related to Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_emperors","surface_form":"Roman emperors","offset":58},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":128},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":192},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"class","offset":212},{"uri":"Patrician","surface_form":"Patrician","offset":271},{"uri":"Julia_the_Younger","surface_form":"Julia the Younger","offset":435},{"uri":"Granddaughter","surface_form":"granddaughter","offset":461}]}
