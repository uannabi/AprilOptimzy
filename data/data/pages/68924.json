{"id":68924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_enhancement","text":"Male enhancement supplements work by increasing the amount of blood flow the genital region receives and the volume of blood that it can retain. In a flaccid state, the penis, like any other part of the body, receives a normal amount of blood flow. When an erection occurs, the penis is surged with a rich supply of blood which is then trapped in the spongy tissues of the Cavernosa and Spongiosum.\nMale enhancement supplements can be synthetic or herbal. Synthetic ones may have more side-effects.\nThe time it takes to see results, said to be a matter of weeks, depends on a man's body type, eating habits, overall health, genetics, and other factors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":62},{"uri":"Erection","surface_form":"erection","offset":257},{"uri":"Side-effect","surface_form":"side-effect","offset":485}]}
