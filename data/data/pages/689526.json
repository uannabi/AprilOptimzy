{"id":689526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostatics","text":"Magnetostatics is the study of magnetic fields in systems where the electric currents are steady (not changing with time).\nMagnetostatics is widely used in magnetic storage devices such as in computer memory. Magnetostatic focussing can be got by a permanent magnet or by passing a current through a coil of wire whose axis coincides with the beam axis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":31},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":68},{"uri":"Magnetic_storage","surface_form":"magnetic storage","offset":156},{"uri":"Computer_memory","surface_form":"computer memory","offset":192},{"uri":"Permanent_magnet","surface_form":"permanent magnet","offset":249}]}
