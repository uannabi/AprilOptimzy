{"id":689663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_taxes_in_Canada","text":"e=\"preserve\">Every Canadian with income must file an income tax return every year. People earning a small amount are exempt from this requirement. Unlike Americans, Canadian citizens who live outside Canada are exempt from filing an income tax return and paying taxes to Canada, unless their income is derived in Canada.\nThe income tax returns are assessed by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Sometimes the filer must pay and other times they get a refund. Most employees pay income tax in advance through employer deductions. This is called tax withholding. When tax witholding exceeds the income tax due for the year, the employee can get a refund when filing their tax return.\nIncome tax in Canada is very complex. The Income Tax Act contains over over one million words\nThe deadline for filing an income tax return is April 30th of the following year. Those who owe money to the government and miss the deadline pay interest on the amount owed plus a penalty.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Income_tax_return","surface_form":"income tax return","offset":53},{"uri":"Exempt","surface_form":"exempt","offset":117},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":200},{"uri":"Canada_Revenue_Agency","surface_form":"Canada Revenue Agency","offset":360},{"uri":"Refund","surface_form":"refund","offset":445},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":458},{"uri":"Employer_deduction","surface_form":"employer deduction","offset":502},{"uri":"Tax_withholding","surface_form":"tax withholding","offset":538},{"uri":"Income_Tax_Act","surface_form":"Income Tax Act","offset":718},{"uri":"Deadline","surface_form":"deadline","offset":774},{"uri":"Interest","surface_form":"interest","offset":916},{"uri":"Tax_penalty","surface_form":"penalty","offset":951}]}
