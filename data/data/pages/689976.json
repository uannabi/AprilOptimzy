He was known for his work in computer science, coding theory and combinatorial game theory. He was a professor emeritus of mathematics and EECS at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the inventor of an algorithm to factor polynomials. He was one of the inventors of the Berlekamp\u2013Welch and the Berlekamp\u2013Massey algorithms. These are used for Reed\u2013Solomon error correction.\nBerlekamp was born in Dover, Ohio. His family later moved to northern Kentucky. He was married to Jennifer. The couple had three children.\nBerlekamp died on April 9, 2019 in Piedmont, California of pulmonary fibrosis-related problems, at the age of 78.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":65},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":74},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":118},{"uri":"Coding_theory","surface_form":"coding theory","offset":136},{"uri":"Combinatorial_game_theory","surface_form":"combinatorial game theory","offset":154},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":190},{"uri":"Emeritus","surface_form":"emeritus","offset":200},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":212},{"uri":"Computer_Science_and_Engineering","surface_form":"EECS","offset":228},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":240},{"uri":"Inventor","surface_form":"inventor","offset":287},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":302},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomial","offset":322},{"uri":"Berlekamp%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm","surface_form":"Berlekamp\u2013Welch","offset":370},{"uri":"Berlekamp%E2%80%93Massey_algorithm","surface_form":"Berlekamp\u2013Massey algorithm","offset":394},{"uri":"Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction","surface_form":"Reed\u2013Solomon error correction","offset":442},{"uri":"Dover%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Dover","offset":495},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":502},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":543},{"uri":"Piedmont%2C_California","surface_form":"Piedmont, California","offset":647},{"uri":"Pulmonary_fibrosis","surface_form":"pulmonary fibrosis","offset":671}]}
