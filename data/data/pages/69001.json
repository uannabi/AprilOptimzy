{"id":69001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Baryshnikov","text":"Mikhail Nikolaevitch Baryshnikov (, born 27 January 1948) is a Russian-American dancer, choreographer, and actor. Born in Latvia to Russian parents during the time of the Soviet Union, he later became an American citizen. After a promising start in the Kirov Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre, Leningrad, he defected to Canada in 1974 for more opportunities in western dance.\nHe has been called the world's greatest living male ballet dancer. Critic Clive Barnes once called him, \"The most perfect dancer I have ever seen\".\nWhile on a tour in Canada with the Kirov Ballet in 1974, Baryshnikov asked for political asylum in Toronto. He became an American citizen in 1986. He has won three Emmy Awards.\nPart of his significance is that he danced both classical ballet and modern dance. From 1978 he worked full-time in the New York City Ballet under the direction of George Balanchine. In 1980 he became Artistic Director of the American Ballet Theatre. Later he founded his own company and moved towards modern dance. He has danced many times on television in North America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":63},{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":71},{"uri":"Dancer","surface_form":"dancer","offset":80},{"uri":"Choreographer","surface_form":"choreographer","offset":88},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actor","offset":107},{"uri":"Latvia","surface_form":"Latvia","offset":122},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":132},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":171},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":204},{"uri":"Kirov_Ballet","surface_form":"Kirov Ballet","offset":253},{"uri":"Mariinsky_Theatre","surface_form":"Mariinsky Theatre","offset":273},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Leningrad","offset":292},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":318},{"uri":"Ballet","surface_form":"ballet","offset":426},{"uri":"Critic","surface_form":"Critic","offset":441},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":541},{"uri":"Kirov_Ballet","surface_form":"Kirov Ballet","offset":557},{"uri":"Political_asylum","surface_form":"political asylum","offset":601},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":621},{"uri":"Emmy_Awards","surface_form":"Emmy Awards","offset":686},{"uri":"Classical_ballet","surface_form":"classical ballet","offset":747},{"uri":"Modern_dance","surface_form":"modern dance","offset":768},{"uri":"New_York_City_Ballet","surface_form":"New York City Ballet","offset":819},{"uri":"George_Balanchine","surface_form":"George Balanchine","offset":863},{"uri":"American_Ballet_Theatre","surface_form":"American Ballet Theatre","offset":925}]}
