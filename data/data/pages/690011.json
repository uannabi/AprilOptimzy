{"id":690011,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet","text":"\"Beresheet\" was a demonstrator of a small robotic lunar lander and lunar probe. It was privately funded in Israel and was planned to land on the moon. The lander was known as \"Sparrow\", and was officially named \"Beresheet\" (, \"Genesis\") in December 2018.\nOn 11 April 2019, the failure of an IMU unit caused a chain of events, leading to the shutoff of the main engine, which caused the lander to crash on the Moon. On 13 April 2019, Beresheet-2 was announced.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lunar_lander","surface_form":"lunar lander","offset":50},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":107},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":145},{"uri":"Book_of_Genesis","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":227}]}
