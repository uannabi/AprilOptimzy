{"id":690276,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nardwuar","text":"John Ruskin (born July 5, 1968), better known as Nardwuar the Human Serviette or simply Nardwuar, is a Canadian interviewer and musician. He is the lead singer and keyboardist for the garage rock band The Evaporators. He is best known for his quirky appearance and style of interview. He does a lot of research on people he interviews. In his interviews, mostly with rappers and other musicians, he will bring up something about the interviewee that is not very well known to the public to confuse, scare or impress them. For example, during an interview with Pharrell Williams from N.E.R.D, Nardwuar pulled out a vinyl record featuring the very first recorded track by Williams, causing him to pause and say, \"This is one of the most impressive interviews I've ever experienced in my life. Seriously.\" Later in the same interview, Williams said, \"Your research is second-to-none. Second-to-none.\"\nNardwuar was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1999, he had a brain hemorrhage, and in 2015, he had a stroke.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":103},{"uri":"Interview","surface_form":"interview","offset":112},{"uri":"Lead_singer","surface_form":"lead singer","offset":148},{"uri":"Keyboardist","surface_form":"keyboardist","offset":164},{"uri":"Garage_rock","surface_form":"garage rock","offset":184},{"uri":"The_Evaporators","surface_form":"The Evaporators","offset":201},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":302},{"uri":"Rapper","surface_form":"rapper","offset":367},{"uri":"Pharrell_Williams","surface_form":"Pharrell Williams","offset":560},{"uri":"N.E.R.D","surface_form":"N.E.R.D","offset":583},{"uri":"Vinyl_record","surface_form":"vinyl record","offset":614},{"uri":"Vancouver","surface_form":"Vancouver","offset":919},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":930},{"uri":"Brain_hemorrhage","surface_form":"brain hemorrhage","offset":966},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":1006}]}
