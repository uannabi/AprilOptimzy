{"id":69048,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging","text":"Begging means asking people for money, food, shelter or other things, when one is not able to give anything instead. It is also referred to as sponging, spanging (short for \"spare-changing\") or (in American English) panhandling.\nIn larger cities, it is common to see beggars who ask for money, food, or other items. Typically, beggars often beg for spare change using coffee cups, mugs, small boxes, hats, or other items into which monies can be placed and sometimes display signs with messages such as \"Help me. I'm homeless.\"\nUse of funds obtained by begging.\nA 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $638 CAD, those interviewed spent a median of $200 CAD on food and $192 CAD on alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. The Fraser Institute, however, criticized this study. They said there were many forms of begging including ones in which good money can be earned. They also said that panhandlers' reports were not reliable\nBecause of this, some people say that it would be better to give the beggars gift cards or food/service vouchers, instead of money. Some shelters also offer business cards with information on the shelter's location and services, which can be given instead of cash.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":32},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":39},{"uri":"Shelter","surface_form":"shelter","offset":45},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":198},{"uri":"2002","surface_form":"2002","offset":564},{"uri":"Canadian_dollar","surface_form":"CAD","offset":653},{"uri":"Fraser_Institute","surface_form":"Fraser Institute","offset":767},{"uri":"Criticize","surface_form":"criticize","offset":794}]}
