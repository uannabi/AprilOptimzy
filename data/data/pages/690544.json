The last edition was in 1935.\nHistory.\nThe \"New International Encyclopedia\" was an update of The \"International Cyclopaedia\", which was last published in 1884. In turn, the \"International Cyclopaedia\" was largely a copy of Alden's \"Library of Universal Knowledge\". That in its turn was a reprint of \"Chambers's Encyclopaedia\". The original 1902 edition was edited by Harry Thurston Peck, Daniel Colt Gilman, and Frank Moore Colby.\nThe encyclopedia was printed in 1904, 1905, 1907, 1909, and 1911. Then a second edition was made from 1914 to 1917. By that time Peck and Gilman had died, so Talcott Williams helped edit. A 3rd edition was made in 1923, and more subjects were added to it in 1927 and 1930. A final edition was made in 1935.\nSome of the last edition became part of \"Funk & Wagnalls\" \"Standard Encyclopaedia\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Encyclopedia","surface_form":"encyclopedia","offset":43},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":62},{"uri":"Chambers%27s_Encyclopaedia","surface_form":"Chambers's Encyclopaedia","offset":381},{"uri":"Funk_%26amp%3B_Wagnalls","surface_form":"Funk & Wagnalls","offset":860}]}
