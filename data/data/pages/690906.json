{"id":690906,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norman","text":"Peter George Norman (15 June 1942 \u2013 3 October 2006) was an Australian track and field athlete. He won the silver medal in the 200 metre sprint at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Also at the 1968 Olympics, Norman supported African-American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos in their Black Power salute. He also wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR) badge as he stood on the podium with Smith and Carlos. Norman's act has been praised but afterwards his career suffered. He was not chosen for the 1972 Summer Olympics and soon retired. He was coached by Neville Sillitoe. The House of Representatives gave an official apology for this in October 2012.\nNorman was born in Coburg, Victoria. He was twice married and had four children. He died of a heart attack on 3 October 2006 in Melbourne. He was 64.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":59},{"uri":"Track_and_field","surface_form":"track and field","offset":70},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":130},{"uri":"Sprint","surface_form":"sprint","offset":136},{"uri":"1968_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1968 Summer Olympics","offset":150},{"uri":"Mexico_City","surface_form":"Mexico City","offset":174},{"uri":"Support","surface_form":"supported","offset":221},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":231},{"uri":"Tommie_Smith","surface_form":"Tommie Smith","offset":258},{"uri":"John_Carlos","surface_form":"John Carlos","offset":275},{"uri":"1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute","surface_form":"Black Power salute","offset":296},{"uri":"Olympic_Project_for_Human_Rights","surface_form":"Olympic Project for Human Rights","offset":332},{"uri":"1972_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1972 Summer Olympics","offset":519},{"uri":"Retired","surface_form":"retired","offset":549},{"uri":"Coach_(sports)","surface_form":"coached","offset":565},{"uri":"Neville_Sillitoe","surface_form":"Neville Sillitoe","offset":576},{"uri":"Australian_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":598},{"uri":"Apology","surface_form":"apology","offset":640},{"uri":"Coburg%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Coburg","offset":693},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":701},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":768},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":802}]}
