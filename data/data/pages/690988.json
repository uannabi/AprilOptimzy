{"id":690988,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_sauce","text":"Fish sauce is an Asian cooking ingredient. It is made from fish or krill which has been coated in salt and then fermented for up to two years. It is used as a seasoning in quite a lot of Asian dishes, particularly those from Burma, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nFish sauce is used by chefs to add the umami flavor to dishes. Soy sauce is sometimes considered a vegetarian alternative to fish sauce.\nIn French and international cuisine the corresponding term is fish stock. That is made differently and tastes different.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Krill","surface_form":"krill","offset":67},{"uri":"Seasoning","surface_form":"seasoning","offset":159},{"uri":"Burma","surface_form":"Burma","offset":225},{"uri":"Cambodia","surface_form":"Cambodia","offset":232},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":242},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":249},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":260},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":266},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":276},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":289},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":297},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":311},{"uri":"Umami","surface_form":"umami","offset":359},{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French","offset":460},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":485},{"uri":"Fish_stock_(food)","surface_form":"fish stock","offset":519}]}
