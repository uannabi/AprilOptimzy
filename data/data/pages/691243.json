It provides information about Russia modifying the results of the 2016 United States presidential election. Robert Mueller released this official document to argue that Donald Trump is using Russia to help get him to become the current president.\nThe first half of the report shows that the Trump campaign had many ties to the Russians and that there was interference in America\u2019s elections.
