{"id":69134,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root","text":"We write the nth root of \"r\" as formula_1. If \"n\" is 2, then the radical expression is a square root. If it is 3, it is a cube root. Other values of n are referred to using ordinal numbers, such as \"fourth root\" and \"tenth root\".\nFor example, formula_1 because formula_1. The 8 in that example is called the radicand, the 3 is called the index, and the check-shaped part is called the radical symbol or radical sign.\nRoots and powers can be changed as shown in formula_1.\nThe product property of a radical expression is the statement that formula_1. The quotient property of a radical expression is the statement formula_1.\nSimplifying.\nThis is an example of how to simplify a radical.\nIf two radicals are the same, they can be combined. This is when both of the indexes and radicands are the same.\nThis is how to find the perfect square and rationalize the denominator.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Square_root","surface_form":"square root","offset":89},{"uri":"Exponentiation","surface_form":"power","offset":427},{"uri":"Square_number","surface_form":"perfect square","offset":823},{"uri":"Rationalization_(mathematics)","surface_form":"rationalize the denominator","offset":842}]}
