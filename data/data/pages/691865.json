{"id":691865,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amiens","text":"The Treaty of Amiens (French: \"la paix d'Amiens\") temporarily ended hostilities between France and the United Kingdom during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was signed in the city of Amiens on 25 March 1802 (4 Germinal X in the French Revolutionary calendar) by Joseph Bonaparte and Marquess Cornwallis as a \"Definitive Treaty of Peace.\" The consequent peace lasted only one year (18 May 1803) and was the only period of general peace in Europe between 1793 and 1814.\nUnder the treaty, Britain recognised the French Republic. Together with the Treaty of Lun\u00E9ville (1801), the Treaty of Amiens marked the end of the Second Coalition, which had waged war against Revolutionary France since 1798.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":22},{"uri":"French_First_Republic","surface_form":"France","offset":88},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":103},{"uri":"French_Revolutionary_Wars","surface_form":"French Revolutionary Wars","offset":129},{"uri":"Amiens","surface_form":"Amiens","offset":185},{"uri":"French_Revolutionary_calendar","surface_form":"French Revolutionary calendar","offset":230},{"uri":"Joseph_Bonaparte","surface_form":"Joseph Bonaparte","offset":264},{"uri":"Charles_Cornwallis%2C_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis","surface_form":"Cornwallis","offset":294},{"uri":"Coalition_Wars","surface_form":"between 1793 and 1814","offset":447},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Lun%C3%A9ville","surface_form":"Treaty of Lun\u00E9ville","offset":546},{"uri":"Second_Coalition","surface_form":"Second Coalition","offset":617}]}
