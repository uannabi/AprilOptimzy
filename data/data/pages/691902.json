{"id":691902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B","text":"Microsoft Visual C++ is a coding environment made by Microsoft, mainly used for coding in C and C++. The software provides helpful tools for programmers, such as a debugging tool to help find bugs in written code. The program is available in both trial and free versions.\nSome programs require the Visual C++ library package to be installed on the computer in order to run in the first place.\nThe previous version of Visual C++ was called \"Microsoft C/C++\", originally used to compile code written in C. The first version of Microsoft Visual C++ was officially released in February of 1993.\nThe product was first created as an environment for C programming, however it only supported the original C library rather than the C99 revision. In 2013, Visual C++ included support for various C99 features, however it was not until 2015 that Visual C++ included full support of the C99 standard library. The C11 revision that replaced the C99 revision is still not supported in recent versions of Visual C++, however the company has plans to add them in future versions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":53},{"uri":"C_(programming_language)","surface_form":"C","offset":90},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":96},{"uri":"Programmers","surface_form":"programmers","offset":141},{"uri":"Debugging","surface_form":"debugging","offset":164}]}
