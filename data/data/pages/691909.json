{"id":691909,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_song","text":"A novelty song is a type of song that is meant to be funny, usually because of silly lyrics or lyrics that don't make a lot of sense. A song is considered a novelty song when it uses strange lyrics, strange music, out-of-the-ordinary subject matter, or any combination of the above. However, not all comedic songs are novelty songs.\nNovelty songs are often parodies, mocking or poking fun at a popular topic or fad.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
