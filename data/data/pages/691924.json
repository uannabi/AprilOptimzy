It is found in southern Mexico and Central/South America. The silky anteater is active at night and lives alone in trees. One of its most noticeable features are the two large claws on each of its front paws, which it uses to cling to branches and defend itself. It can use its tail to grasp things. It has soft yellow to grey fur.\nLike other anteaters, it is an insectivore (eats mainly insects) and like to eat ants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anteater","surface_form":"anteater","offset":101},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":135},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central","offset":146},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":154},{"uri":"Insectivore","surface_form":"insectivore","offset":474}]}
