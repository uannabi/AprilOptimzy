It is used in French and international cuisine.\nThis stock is the basis of fish soups and sauces. It is usually made with fish bones and fish heads, together with finely chopped mirepoix. The fish stock is cooked for 20\u201325 minutes\u2014cooking any longer spoils the flavour. Concentrated fish stock is called \"fish fumet\".\nIn Japan, a fish and kelp stock called dashi is made by briefly (3\u20135 minutes) cooking skipjack tuna (bonito) flakes called \"katsuobushi\" in nearly boiling water. Other Japanese fish stock is made from fish that have been fried and boiled for several hours, creating a white milky broth. This has a rich feel and sweet umami taste.\nFor fish stocks in other Asian cooking, see fish sauce.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stock_(food)","surface_form":"stock","offset":24},{"uri":"French_cuisine","surface_form":"French","offset":66},{"uri":"Cuisine","surface_form":"cuisine","offset":91},{"uri":"Fish_soup","surface_form":"fish soup","offset":127},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":142},{"uri":"Mirepoix_(cuisine)","surface_form":"mirepoix","offset":230},{"uri":"Kelp","surface_form":"kelp","offset":391},{"uri":"Dashi","surface_form":"dashi","offset":409},{"uri":"Skipjack_tuna","surface_form":"skipjack tuna","offset":456},{"uri":"Bonito","surface_form":"bonito","offset":471},{"uri":"Katsuobushi","surface_form":"katsuobushi","offset":494},{"uri":"Umami","surface_form":"umami","offset":688},{"uri":"Fish_sauce","surface_form":"fish sauce","offset":745}]}
