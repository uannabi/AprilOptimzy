They are also known as large carrion beetles or burying beetles. They are the the family Silphidae, which belongs to the order Coleoptera.\nOver 180 species of such beetles are known. They lay their eggs into raw flesh, and the lavae feed on raw flesh (or dead animals). Sometimes the adults hunt and kill the larvae of other insects.\nMost carrion beetles only walk: they have lost the power of flight. The do walk for long distances in search of dead animals to lay their eggs on.\nMost species occur on the northern hemisphere, in temperate climates. Often, they can be found in grassland or woodland areas. In the tropical climates they occur mostly in the mountains, where it is colder. They are not present in the desert.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beetle","surface_form":"beetle","offset":42},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larva","offset":61},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":169},{"uri":"Coleoptera","surface_form":"Coleoptera","offset":214},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":314},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insect","offset":412}]}
