{"id":692265,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_religion","text":"The relationship between homosexuality and religion has changed a lot across place and time, and within and between different religions. There have also been changes in different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality. Present-day doctrines of the world's major religions are vastly different.\nSeveral religions (particularly the Abrahamic ones) do not allow homosexuality and/or same-sex marriage. In other words, some religions will only allow sex within marriage between one man and one woman. For example, in Judaism, the rules teach that man shall not lie with another man as he would with a woman. Most forms of Christianity take a conservative approach on the issue of homosexuality, same-sex marriage and LGBT rights: including the Eastern Orthodox Church, Mormonism, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church and many strains of Protestantism (including Evangelicalism, Pentecostalism, Presbyterianism among others)-calling same-sex acts as sinful.\nHowever, there are liberal forms of Christianity accept homosexuality, LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Namely, the United Church of Christ, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Metropolitan Community Church and several others are accepting of homosexuality and LGBT rights.\nSome religous fundamentalist<nowiki/>s have said that HIV/AIDS is a punishment from God against homosexual people.\nConservative denominations often oppose same-sex sexual relations based on Old and New Testament that call human sexual relations as strictly heterosexual (in other words, between one man and one woman).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":126},{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"homosexuality","offset":188},{"uri":"Bisexuality","surface_form":"bisexuality","offset":206},{"uri":"Same-sex_marriage","surface_form":"same-sex marriage","offset":380},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":513},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":618},{"uri":"LGBT_rights","surface_form":"LGBT rights","offset":713},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox Church","offset":740},{"uri":"Mormonism","surface_form":"Mormonism","offset":765},{"uri":"Oriental_Orthodoxy","surface_form":"Oriental Orthodoxy","offset":776},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":800},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestantism","offset":842},{"uri":"Evangelicalism","surface_form":"Evangelicalism","offset":867},{"uri":"Pentecostalism","surface_form":"Pentecostalism","offset":883},{"uri":"Presbyterianism","surface_form":"Presbyterianism","offset":899},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Community_Church","surface_form":"Metropolitan Community Church","offset":1142},{"uri":"Fundamentalism","surface_form":"fundamentalist","offset":1253},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":1293},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":1297},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":1323},{"uri":"Old_Testament","surface_form":"Old","offset":1429},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":1437},{"uri":"Heterosexuality","surface_form":"heterosexual","offset":1496}]}
