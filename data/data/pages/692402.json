{"id":692402,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy (CRP) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (because it involves the nerve roots).\nCIDP is closely related to Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome and it is thought to be the chronic counterpart of that acute disease. Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Autoimmune_disorder","surface_form":"immune-mediated inflammatory disorder","offset":76},{"uri":"Peripheral_nervous_system","surface_form":"peripheral nervous system","offset":121},{"uri":"Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome","surface_form":"Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome","offset":347},{"uri":"Chronic_(medical)","surface_form":"chronic","offset":399},{"uri":"Acute_(medicine)","surface_form":"acute","offset":427},{"uri":"Progressive_inflammatory_neuropathy","surface_form":"progressive inflammatory neuropathy","offset":475}]}
