Mayda Insula is the first island (insula) to be named on a planet or moon other than Earth.\nDiscovery and naming.\nMayda Insula was discovered by the \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" mission to Saturn. Its name was approved by the International Astronomical Union Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature on April 11, 2008. It became the first named island anywhere other than earth. However, there is a possibility that Mayda Insula is actually peninsular. A peninsular is a piece of land that is connected to the mainland by another strip of land. All of the island on Titan have been named after legendary islands. \"Mayda Insula\" was named after a legendary island Mayda which was thought to exist in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Its name was approved the same day as the names of Kraken Mare and Ligeia Mare.\nIn popular culture.\nMayda Insula was mentioned in Michael Carroll's novel \"On the Shores of Titan's Farthest Sea: A Scientific Novel\". The 39th chapter of the book is titled \"The Hunchback of Mayda Insula\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kraken_Mare","surface_form":"Kraken Mare","offset":33},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":62},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":88},{"uri":"Saturn","surface_form":"Saturn's","offset":100},{"uri":"Titan_(moon)","surface_form":"Titan","offset":122},{"uri":"Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens","surface_form":"Cassini\u2013Huygens","offset":279},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature","offset":344},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsular","offset":566},{"uri":"Mayda","surface_form":"Mayda","offset":788},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":841},{"uri":"Ligeia_Mare","surface_form":"Ligeia Mare","offset":924},{"uri":"Michael_Carroll_(space_artist)","surface_form":"Michael Carroll","offset":987}]}
