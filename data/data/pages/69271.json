{"id":69271,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Orthodox_Church","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania is one of the Eastern Orthodox churches. It is very new. It was created in 1922 by the fathers of the Albanian Orthodoxy Fan Noli, Visarion Xhuvani, and others. The Albanian Orthodox Church is autocephalous, meaning its bishop does not have to answer before any superior clerical authority.\nSince its beginning it has had a difficult time. The church suffered during the Second World War, and in the communist period that came after. This became worse after 1967 when Albania was declared an atheist state, and no public or private expression of religion was allowed. After religious freedom returned in 1991, the church has become very active again. More than 250 churches have been created or repaired, and more than 100 clergy being ordained.\nThe Church currently has four dioceses, Tirana, Durr\u00EBs and Elbasan; Berat and Kanina; Gjirokast\u00EBr; and Kor\u00E7\u00EB.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox","offset":72},{"uri":"1922","surface_form":"1922","offset":133},{"uri":"Fan_Noli","surface_form":"Fan Noli","offset":179},{"uri":"Visarion_Xhuvani","surface_form":"Visarion Xhuvani","offset":189},{"uri":"Autocephaly","surface_form":"autocephalous","offset":251},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":278},{"uri":"Clergy","surface_form":"clerical","offset":329},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":429},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communist","offset":458},{"uri":"1967","surface_form":"1967","offset":516},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheist","offset":550},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"freedom","offset":642},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":662},{"uri":"Clergy","surface_form":"clergy","offset":781},{"uri":"Diocese","surface_form":"diocese","offset":834},{"uri":"Tirana","surface_form":"Tirana","offset":844},{"uri":"Durr%C3%ABs","surface_form":"Durr\u00EBs","offset":852},{"uri":"Elbasan","surface_form":"Elbasan","offset":863},{"uri":"Berat","surface_form":"Berat","offset":872},{"uri":"Gjirokast%C3%ABr","surface_form":"Gjirokast\u00EBr","offset":890},{"uri":"Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB","surface_form":"Kor\u00E7\u00EB","offset":907}]}
