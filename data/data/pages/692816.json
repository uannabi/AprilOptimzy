It grew in popularity by Marvin Harris in 1968 through his book The Rise of Anthropological Theory. It brings together many different ideas such as Marxism, cultural evolution, and cultural ecology.\nIn order to understand societies as a cultural materialist, you need to first divide up societies into three parts: infrastructure, structure, and superstructure.\nInfrastructure provides the footing for the following parts, providing basic needs for the society.\nStructure, is the well being of a society\u2019s political, social, economic organizations.\nSuperstructure is the way ideas are used within symbols in a society.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marvin_Harris","surface_form":"Marvin Harris","offset":112},{"uri":"Marxism","surface_form":"Marxism","offset":235}]}
