It was created in 1222. It is one of the oldest European universities and the second oldest in Italy. As of 2003, the university had about 65,000 students.\nHistory.\nThe university is usually said to have been founded in 1222 when a big group of students and professors left the University of Bologna. They did this to look for more academic freedom ('Libertas scholastica').\nThe first subjects to be taught were law and theology. The curriculum got bigger quickly, and by 1399 the institution had divided in two: a \"Universitas Iuristarum\" for civil law and Canon law, and a \"Universitas Artistarum\" which taught astronomy, dialectic, philosophy, grammar, medicine, and rhetoric.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":25},{"uri":"Padua","surface_form":"Padua","offset":82},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":89},{"uri":"1222","surface_form":"1222","offset":114},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":144},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"universities","offset":153},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":204},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":354},{"uri":"University_of_Bologna","surface_form":"University of Bologna","offset":374},{"uri":"Academic_freedom","surface_form":"academic freedom","offset":428},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":508},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":516},{"uri":"Curriculum","surface_form":"curriculum","offset":530},{"uri":"Institution","surface_form":"institution","offset":577},{"uri":"Divide","surface_form":"divide","offset":593},{"uri":"Civil_law_(common_law)","surface_form":"civil law","offset":640},{"uri":"Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)","surface_form":"Canon law","offset":654},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":709},{"uri":"Dialectic","surface_form":"dialectic","offset":720},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":731},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":743},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":752},{"uri":"Rhetoric","surface_form":"rhetoric","offset":766}]}
