{"id":692845,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_832c","text":"Gliese 832c is a extrasolar planet that goes around the red dwarf Gliese 832. It is found about 16 light years from Earth in the Grus constellation. It has 5.2 times the mass of Earth, and has a radius of 1.5 times Earth's radius. The planet is thought to be on the hot edge habitable zone: the part of the habitable zone closest to the star.\nHabitability.\nGliese 832c is thought to lie in the habitable zone, which is the zone around a star where water can be liquid. However, it may not be hospitable to life as we know it. While it gets about as much sunlight as Earth does, the planet is probably tidally locked, This means that one side of the planet is always facing the star. This would mean that the day side of the planet is extremely hot, while the dark side is cold. Between the day and night zones, life might be able to exist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extrasolar_planet","surface_form":"extrasolar planet","offset":17},{"uri":"Red_dwarf","surface_form":"red dwarf","offset":56},{"uri":"Gliese_832","surface_form":"Gliese 832","offset":66},{"uri":"Light-year","surface_form":"light years","offset":99},{"uri":"Grus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Grus","offset":129},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":134},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":195},{"uri":"Habitable_zone","surface_form":"habitable zone","offset":275},{"uri":"Tidally_locked","surface_form":"tidally locked","offset":601}]}
