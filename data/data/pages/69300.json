{"id":69300,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare","text":"Anti-aircraft warfare, or air defence, is any way of fighting military aircraft in combat from the ground. Different guns and cannons have been used for this since the first military aircraft were used in World War I. They have become more powerful over the years. After World War II, Surface to Air Missile<nowiki/>s began to be used too. Today, both are used to fight against aircraft.\nNicknames for anti-aircraft guns include AAA or triple-A, an abbreviation for \"anti-aircraft a'\"rtillery\", and flak or flack (from the German \"Flugabwehrk'\"anone\", \"aircraft defence cannon\"). An anti-aircraft missile is another name for a surface-to-air missile, also said SAM for short.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":62},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":71},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"gun","offset":117},{"uri":"Cannon","surface_form":"cannon","offset":126},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":205},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":271},{"uri":"Surface_to_Air_Missile","surface_form":"Surface to Air Missile","offset":285},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"Nickname","offset":388},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviation","offset":449},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":523},{"uri":"Surface-to-air_missile","surface_form":"SAM","offset":661}]}
