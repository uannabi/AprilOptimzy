Critics did not like it as much as \"White Teeth\".\nAfter the publication of \"The Autograph Man\", Smith visited the United States as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.\nSmith's third novel, \"On Beauty\", was published in September 2005. The story happens mostly in and around Greater Boston. It received better reviews than \"The Autograph Man\": it was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and won the 2006 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.\nAlso in 2005, Smith published \"Martha and Hanwell\". This book combines two short stories about two troubled characters. The stories had been published first in \"Granta\" and \"The New Yorker\". Penguin published \"Martha and Hanwell\" with a new introduction by the author as part of their pocket series to celebrate their 70th birthday.

Starring Nikki Amuka-Bird and Phoebe Fox, it was broadcast on BBC Two on 14 November 2016.\nSmith's fifth novel, \"Swing Time\", was published in November 2016. It was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize 2017.\nBetween March and October 2011, Smith was the monthly New Books reviewer for \"Harper's Magazine\".

She also uses his name in \"White Teeth\": \"An' all the good-lookin' men, all the \"rides\" like your man Nicky Laird, they're all dead.\"\nThe couple lived in Rome, Italy, from November 2006 to 2007.
