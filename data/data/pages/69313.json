{"id":69313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Temple","text":"The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple is one of the four Inns of Court around the Royal Courts of Justice in London. They may call members to the Bar and allow them to practice as barristers. (The other Inns are Middle Temple, Gray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn.)\nThe Inner Temple was first recorded as being used for legal purposes when lawyers' houses were burned down in Wat Tyler's revolt in 1381. Before that date, the Temple was occupied by the Knights Templar. The Inner Temple was damaged during the wartime bombings in the areas surrounding the River Thames.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Inns_of_Court","surface_form":"Inns of Court","offset":62},{"uri":"Royal_Courts_of_Justice","surface_form":"Royal Courts of Justice","offset":87},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":114},{"uri":"Bar_association","surface_form":"Bar","offset":151},{"uri":"Barrister","surface_form":"barrister","offset":185},{"uri":"Middle_Temple","surface_form":"Middle Temple","offset":217},{"uri":"Gray%27s_Inn","surface_form":"Gray's Inn","offset":232},{"uri":"Lincoln%27s_Inn","surface_form":"Lincoln's Inn","offset":247},{"uri":"Wat_Tyler","surface_form":"Wat Tyler","offset":373},{"uri":"Knights_Templar","surface_form":"Knights Templar","offset":450},{"uri":"River_Thames","surface_form":"River Thames","offset":553}]}
