They may call members to the Bar and allow them to practice as barristers. (The other Inns are Middle Temple, Gray's Inn and Inner Temple.)\nLincoln's Inn is thought to be the oldest of the four Inns of Court. The history of the Inn can be traced back to 1422, although its actual origins are even older.\nIt is situated in Holborn, in the London Borough of Camden, just on the border with the City of London and the City of Westminster.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Inns_of_Court","surface_form":"Inns of Court","offset":59},{"uri":"Royal_Courts_of_Justice","surface_form":"Royal Courts of Justice","offset":84},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":111},{"uri":"Bar_association","surface_form":"Bar","offset":148},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"barrister","offset":182},{"uri":"Middle_Temple","surface_form":"Middle Temple","offset":214},{"uri":"Gray%27s_Inn","surface_form":"Gray's Inn","offset":229},{"uri":"Inner_Temple","surface_form":"Inner Temple","offset":244},{"uri":"Holborn","surface_form":"Holborn","offset":441},{"uri":"London_Borough_of_Camden","surface_form":"London Borough of Camden","offset":457},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City of London","offset":511},{"uri":"City_of_Westminster","surface_form":"City of Westminster","offset":534}]}
