He was the Michael Henry Strater Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Princeton University. He worked in number theory, automorphic forms, and arithmetic geometry.\nHe was known for developing the theory of complex multiplication of abelian varieties and Shimura varieties, as well as the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture which led to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\nShimura died on 3 May 2019 at the age of 89.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":20},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":29},{"uri":"Professor_Emeritus","surface_form":"Professor Emeritus","offset":77},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"Mathematics","offset":99},{"uri":"Princeton_University","surface_form":"Princeton University","offset":114},{"uri":"Number_theory","surface_form":"number theory","offset":149},{"uri":"Automorphic_form","surface_form":"automorphic form","offset":164},{"uri":"Arithmetic_geometry","surface_form":"arithmetic geometry","offset":187},{"uri":"Abelian_variety_of_CM-type","surface_form":"complex multiplication of abelian varieties","offset":250},{"uri":"Shimura_variety","surface_form":"Shimura varieties","offset":298},{"uri":"Taniyama%E2%80%93Shimura_conjecture","surface_form":"Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture","offset":332},{"uri":"Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem","surface_form":"Fermat's Last Theorem","offset":386}]}
