{"id":69336,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiten","text":"The \"Kaiten\" (Japanese: \u56DE\u5929, translated \"Change the World\" or \"Reverse Destiny\") was a torpedo that was changed to become a suicide weapon, and used by the Navy of the Empire of Japan in the last months of the Second World War. It was basically a torpedo with a pilot, and it could be thrown from a submarine or a ship.\nThe \"Kaiten\" was not very effective. Out of more or less 100 attacks made with them, only two enemy ships were sunk.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":14},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translated","offset":28},{"uri":"Torpedo","surface_form":"torpedo","offset":86},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":123},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":131},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"Navy","offset":155},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Empire of Japan","offset":167},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":209},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":261},{"uri":"Submarine","surface_form":"submarine","offset":298},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":313}]}
