{"id":69337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket","text":"e=\"preserve\">A blanket is a large, usually rectangular piece of cloth, generally used on a bed over a sheet to keep the sleeping person warm. Some blankets are knitted or crocheted while others are made of two layers of cloth sewn together with stuffing in the middle. Blankets can be made with hollow fibre or feathers.\nOther names for blankets are quilts, duvets, and comforters, depending on their thickness, construction and/or stuffing.\nThe word blanket probably came from the 14th century. A special kind of fabric called Blanket fabric was created by a Flemish weaver who lived in Bristol, England.\nUses.\nBlankets may also be used on the ground for a picnic or other places where people want to sit without their clothing getting dirty or wet.\nFirefighters use a special fire blanket to protect household items such as chairs from water damage.\nTypes of blankets.\nElectric blankets are heated by electricity. Blankets were traditionally made of wool because it is warm, naturally fire-retardant, and allows air to circulate well, while today synthetic fibers are frequently used. Throw blankets are smaller blankets, often in decorative colors and patterns, that can be used for extra warmth outside of bed.\nOther kinds are horse blankets, used to keep horses warm, and saddle blankets, used to prevent the horse's saddle from rubbing on its skin.\nBlanket terminology is also used in the printing industry. A blanket is a rubber coating over different layer of compressible material. It wraps around a cylinder and insures transfer of ink form the printed material (where the image is ink defined) to the paper. Blankets are used for offset, gravure, flexo, etc.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":64},{"uri":"Bed","surface_form":"bed","offset":91},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":120},{"uri":"Warm","surface_form":"warm","offset":136},{"uri":"Knitting","surface_form":"knitted","offset":160},{"uri":"Crochet","surface_form":"crochet","offset":171},{"uri":"Layer","surface_form":"layer","offset":210},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":588},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":597},{"uri":"Picnic","surface_form":"picnic","offset":658},{"uri":"Fire_blanket","surface_form":"fire blanket","offset":778},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":903},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":952},{"uri":"Horses","surface_form":"horses","offset":1260},{"uri":"Saddle","surface_form":"saddle","offset":1322}]}
