{"id":69347,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving","text":"Weaving is the interlacing of two sets of threads at right angles to each other to form cloth. Weaving is usually done on a loom.\nOne set of threads is called the \"warp\". These threads are held taut and in parallel order on the loom by \"harnesses\" creating a space called the \"shed\". The \"weft\" thread is wound onto \"bobbins\". The bobbins are held in a \"shuttle\", which carries the weft thread through the shed. The warp threads are moved over and under the weft threads.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thread","surface_form":"thread","offset":42},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":88},{"uri":"Loom","surface_form":"loom","offset":124},{"uri":"Parallel","surface_form":"parallel","offset":206},{"uri":"Shuttle","surface_form":"shuttle","offset":354}]}
