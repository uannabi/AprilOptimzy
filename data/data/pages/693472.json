{"id":693472,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown","text":"=\"preserve\">Robert Brown FRS FRSE FLS (21 December 1773 \u2013 10 June 1858) was a Scottish botanist.\nBrown made important contributions to botany by using the microscope. He made an early description of the cell nucleus and cytoplasmic streaming. He saw Brownian motion. He did early work on plant pollination and fertilisation. He was the first to recognise the difference between gymnosperms and angiosperms. He did some of the earliest studies in palynology. He also made numerous contributions to plant taxonomy. He identified plant families which are still accepted today.\nBrown explored Australia with Matthew Flinders. Based on what he saw and collected, he identified many Australian plant genera and species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"FRS","surface_form":"FRS","offset":25},{"uri":"FLS","surface_form":"FLS","offset":34},{"uri":"Scottish_people","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":78},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":87},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":135},{"uri":"Microscope","surface_form":"microscope","offset":155},{"uri":"Cell_nucleus","surface_form":"cell nucleus","offset":203},{"uri":"Cytoplasmic_streaming","surface_form":"cytoplasmic streaming","offset":220},{"uri":"Brownian_motion","surface_form":"Brownian motion","offset":250},{"uri":"Pollination","surface_form":"pollination","offset":294},{"uri":"Fertilisation","surface_form":"fertilisation","offset":310},{"uri":"Gymnosperms","surface_form":"gymnosperms","offset":378},{"uri":"Angiosperms","surface_form":"angiosperms","offset":394},{"uri":"Palynology","surface_form":"palynology","offset":446},{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomy","offset":503},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":589},{"uri":"Matthew_Flinders","surface_form":"Matthew Flinders","offset":604},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":694},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":705}]}
