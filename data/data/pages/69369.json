{"id":69369,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_of_Britain","text":"The Tour of Britain is the name of a cycle race held in United Kingdom. The race is made up of several parts in which the racers go from place to place across parts of Great Britain. The history of the event dates back to 1951. The Tour of Britain is part of the UCI's European Tour.\nThe race includes teams from Scotland and Wales, as well as a Great Britain team. In recent years, no English team has been entered. Teams from outside the UK compete too, for example in 2007 Team T-Mobile will take part.\nThe latest version, a professional stage race, was first run in 2004.\nHistory.\nThe Tour of Britain has had different names. This is because many different companies or groups of people have provided the money needed to have the event happen (\"sponsors\").\n2004 Tour of Britain.\nThe first edition of the latest version of the Tour of Britain took place over five days in early September 2004. It was organised by SweetSpot along with British Cycling. The race was sponsored by the organisers of London's 2012 Olympics bid. It was well-promoted and many well-known teams were a part of the race. Such teams included T-Mobile (Germany) and U.S. Postal Service (USA). This was partly due to it being a 2.3 category race on the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) calendar.\nThe 2004 route ended with a 45 mile (72\u00A0km) criterium in London, where tens of thousands of people watching saw a long break by Londoner Bradley Wiggins last until the final lap. Enrico Degano of Team Barloworld passed him on the final lap to win that stage of the race. The Colombian Mauricio Ardila, of Chocolade Jacques, won the Tour overall.\n2006 Tour of Britain.\nThe Tour of Britain 2006 took place from the 29 August to 3 September as a UCI category 2.1 event. Martin Pedersen and Andy Schleck of Team CSC won the overall and King of the Mountains classification, respectively. Mark Cavendish (T-Mobile Team) won the points classification and Johan Van Summeren (Davitamon-Lotto) captured the sprints classification.\n2007 Tour of Britain.\nThe 2007 edition of the Tour of Britain stage race was run as a UCI 2.1 category in seven stages starting in London on 9 September and finishing in Glasgow on 15 September. The Tour was extended to seven days for 2007, with the extra day being used to run a stage in Somerset for the first time. Instead of finishing in London as in previous years, the 2007 race started in London and finished in Glasgow, which is using the event to boost its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Road_bicycle_racing","surface_form":"cycle race","offset":37},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":56},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":168},{"uri":"1951","surface_form":"1951","offset":222},{"uri":"UCI","surface_form":"UCI","offset":263},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":313},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":326},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":386},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":570},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"companies","offset":661},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":709},{"uri":"British_Cycling","surface_form":"British Cycling","offset":938},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":999},{"uri":"2012_Olympics","surface_form":"2012 Olympics","offset":1008},{"uri":"T-Mobile_Team","surface_form":"T-Mobile","offset":1119},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1129},{"uri":"U.S._Postal_Service_cycling_team","surface_form":"U.S. Postal Service","offset":1142},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":1163},{"uri":"Union_Cycliste_Internationale","surface_form":"Union Cycliste Internationale","offset":1228},{"uri":"Criterium","surface_form":"criterium","offset":1318},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1331},{"uri":"Bradley_Wiggins","surface_form":"Bradley Wiggins","offset":1411},{"uri":"Team_Barloworld","surface_form":"Team Barloworld","offset":1470},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":1549},{"uri":"Mauricio_Ardila","surface_form":"Mauricio Ardila","offset":1559},{"uri":"Chocolade_Jacques-Topsport_Vlaanderen","surface_form":"Chocolade Jacques","offset":1579},{"uri":"Tour_of_Britain_2006","surface_form":"Tour of Britain 2006","offset":1646},{"uri":"29_August","surface_form":"29 August","offset":1687},{"uri":"3_September","surface_form":"3 September","offset":1700},{"uri":"Martin_Pedersen_(cyclist)","surface_form":"Martin Pedersen","offset":1741},{"uri":"Andy_Schleck","surface_form":"Andy Schleck","offset":1761},{"uri":"Team_CSC","surface_form":"Team CSC","offset":1777},{"uri":"General_classification","surface_form":"overall","offset":1794},{"uri":"King_of_the_Mountains","surface_form":"King of the Mountains","offset":1806},{"uri":"Mark_Cavendish","surface_form":"Mark Cavendish","offset":1858},{"uri":"T-Mobile_Team","surface_form":"T-Mobile Team","offset":1874},{"uri":"Johan_Van_Summeren","surface_form":"Johan Van Summeren","offset":1923},{"uri":"Davitamon-Lotto","surface_form":"Davitamon-Lotto","offset":1943},{"uri":"Union_Cycliste_Internationale","surface_form":"UCI","offset":2083},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":2167},{"uri":"Somerset","surface_form":"Somerset","offset":2286},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":2416},{"uri":"2014_Commonwealth_Games","surface_form":"2014 Commonwealth Games","offset":2479}]}
