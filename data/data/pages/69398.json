{"id":69398,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf","text":"The Battle of Leyte Gulf, was the biggest naval battle in modern history. The battle was part of World War II, and happened in the seas near the Philippines island of Leyte. It took place from 23 October to 26 October 1944, between the Allies and the Empire of Japan. The Allies started the battle to cut the way between Japan and its colonies in South East Asia. Japan took its oil for fuel from that area. The Japanese gathered all the ships they had left to fight the Allied troops. However, they failed and lost many ships and aircraft.\nThe battle was the last big naval fight of World War II. Without fuel, the Imperial Japanese Navy never again sailed to battle. Most of their ships returned to Japan, and were inactive for the rest of the war.\nThe first use of kamikaze aircraft was during this battle. A kamikaze hit the Australian flagship \"HMAS Australia\" on 21 October. Many other suicide attacks by the \"Special Attack Force\" began on 25 October, and did great damage to the Allied ships.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"naval","offset":42},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":97},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":131},{"uri":"Philippine","surface_form":"Philippine","offset":145},{"uri":"Leyte","surface_form":"Leyte","offset":167},{"uri":"23_October","surface_form":"23 October","offset":193},{"uri":"26_October","surface_form":"26 October","offset":207},{"uri":"1944","surface_form":"1944","offset":218},{"uri":"Allies_of_World_War_II","surface_form":"Allies","offset":236},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Empire of Japan","offset":251},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":335},{"uri":"South_East_Asia","surface_form":"South East Asia","offset":347},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":379},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":387},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":531},{"uri":"Kamikaze","surface_form":"kamikaze","offset":768},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":829},{"uri":"Flagship","surface_form":"flagship","offset":840},{"uri":"21_October","surface_form":"21 October","offset":869},{"uri":"25_October","surface_form":"25 October","offset":947}]}
