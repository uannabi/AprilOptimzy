{"id":69424,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puncak_Jaya","text":"Puncak Jaya is a mountain in New Guinea. It is the highest mountain in Oceania. It is also called the Carstensz Pyramid.\nThe mountain was first named the Carstensz Pyramid, after Jan Carstenszoon. He was a Dutch explorer who saw the glaciers on it in 1623. Then in 1963 the name was changed to Sukarno Peak by Indonesia, and then later to Puncak Jaya.\nPuncak Jaya is thought of by some as the hardest to climb of the Seven Summits. The first people to reach the top were Heinrich Harrer, Philip Temple, Russell Kippax, and Albertus Huizenga, in 1962. An earlier group were first thought to reach the top in 1936. However, at the time it was not known which summit was the highest. They were able to climb two peaks but not what is now known to be the highest one.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":17},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":29},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"highest","offset":51},{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":71},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":206},{"uri":"Explorer","surface_form":"explorer","offset":212},{"uri":"Glaciers","surface_form":"glaciers","offset":233},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":310},{"uri":"Seven_Summits","surface_form":"Seven Summits","offset":417}]}
