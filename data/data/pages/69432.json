{"id":69432,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia","text":"Nostalgia is an emotion. It is the feeling of enjoying events from the past. People with nostalgia will often look at or use old things that they were familiar with years ago. This is because people feel more connected to those past times that they enjoyed, usually because it reminds them of how long it has been since they last connected to such past times. Examples where people may have the feeling of nostalgia includes watching old TV shows, using old technology that was very enjoyable, and playing with toys that you played as a child.\nDuring the early Greek times, nostalgia was treated as a mental condition primarily based on extreme homesickness. In modern times, however, nostalgia is treated as a separate emotion. Nostalgia is often associated with positive feelings, often associated with positive memories of the past. The feeling of nostalgia often helps improve the mood of the person who is experiencing nostalgia. It also makes the person feel more connected to society. It can make the person feel more aware about living life to the best. Nostalgia is also shown to help reinforce memories, as well as assist with learning.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":16},{"uri":"Homesickness","surface_form":"homesickness","offset":645}]}
