{"id":694499,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy","text":"=\"preserve\">Differential privacy is a mathematically-rigorous definition of privacy. An algorithm uses a dataset to calculate its output. An algorithm is said to be differentially private if, based on its output, it is impossible to tell whether or not a \"particular individual\" was in the dataset.\nIn simpler terms, this property is fulfilled if the algorithm's behavior does not noticeably change when a single individual joins or leaves the dataset.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":88},{"uri":"Dataset","surface_form":"dataset","offset":105}]}
