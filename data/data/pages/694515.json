{"id":694515,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_partridge","text":"The grey partridge (\"Perdix perdix\") is a 30 cm tall bird. It is brown-backed and has grey flanks and chest. The belly is white, usually marked with a large chestnut-brown horse-shoe mark. This mark should not only be the detail to divide into male or female partridge. When disturbed or if it feels danger, it flies a short distance. The song is a harsh \"kieerr-ik\" or \"keev-it\" and often calling \"rick rick rick\" or \"it-it-it\".\nPartridges live in open country including farmland, moorland, downs, steppes, semi-desserts and sand dunes. They prefer a warm and dry climate. They eat grains, seeds and small insects.\nThe scientific name is the Latin for \"partridge\", and is itself derived from Ancient Greek \"perdix\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":643},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":693}]}
