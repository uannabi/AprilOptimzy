{"id":694568,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_School_Official","text":"=\"preserve\">Designated School Official (DSO) is an official U.S. term for anyone who officially represents an American college or university in matters dealing with F-1 (visa category for foreign students to enter the United States) affairs. A school appoints its DSO, but it must also be approved by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), which is a federal government body.\nThe duties of the DSO include signing immigration documents for foreign students. The DOS also supports and advises foreign students.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
