{"id":69483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ace","text":"=\"preserve\">A flying ace or fighter ace is a military pilot who has shot down five or more enemy aircraft in air combat. Use of the term \"ace\" in military aviation began in World War I (1914\u201318). French newspapers called Adolphe Pegoud, as \"l'as\" (French for \"ace\") after he became the first pilot to shoot down five German aircraft. Many other pilots later became aces, and some are very famous today, like the \"Red Baron\", Manfred von Richthofen who had 80 kills.\nErich Hartmann was the ace with the most kills; he had 352.\nSome countries have recognized armor commanders as \"tank aces\" for destroying five enemies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter","surface_form":"fighter","offset":28},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":45},{"uri":"Pilot","surface_form":"pilot","offset":54},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":97},{"uri":"Combat","surface_form":"combat","offset":113},{"uri":"Term","surface_form":"term","offset":132},{"uri":"Aviation","surface_form":"aviation","offset":155},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":173},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":196},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":203},{"uri":"Adolphe_Pegoud","surface_form":"Adolphe Pegoud","offset":221},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":317},{"uri":"Manfred_von_Richthofen","surface_form":"Manfred von Richthofen","offset":425},{"uri":"Erich_Hartmann","surface_form":"Erich Hartmann","offset":466}]}
