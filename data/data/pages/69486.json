Norinaga's most important works include the \"Kojiki-den\" (\"Commentaries on the Kojiki\"), created more than 35 years ago, and his comments on the \"Tale of Genji\".\nMotoori was born in what is now Matsusaka in Ise Province (now part of Mie Prefecture). At the age of 22, Motoori went to Kyoto to study medicine. Although best known as a Kokugaku scholar, Norinaga worked as a doctor for 40 years in Matsusaka.\nHe was the first to use the term Mono no aware, which is now an important concept in Japanese culture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":58},{"uri":"Scholar","surface_form":"scholar","offset":67},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":79},{"uri":"Kojiki","surface_form":"Kojiki","offset":186},{"uri":"Tale_of_Genji","surface_form":"Tale of Genji","offset":253},{"uri":"Matsusaka%2C_Mie","surface_form":"Matsusaka","offset":301},{"uri":"Ise_Province","surface_form":"Ise Province","offset":314},{"uri":"Mie_Prefecture","surface_form":"Mie Prefecture","offset":340},{"uri":"Kyoto","surface_form":"Kyoto","offset":391},{"uri":"Kokugaku","surface_form":"Kokugaku","offset":441},{"uri":"Mono_no_aware","surface_form":"Mono no aware","offset":547},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":608}]}
