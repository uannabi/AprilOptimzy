{"id":69487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valediction","text":"e=\"preserve\">A valediction (or complimentary close) is a phrase used to say goodbye at the end of a letter. It also refers to the act of saying goodbye to someone. It comes from the Latin \"vale dicere\", which means \"to say farewell\". Valedictions are normally written before the signature in a written message. The words used usually express respect or regard for the person to whom the message is written.\nEnglish valedictions often contain the possessive pronoun \"yours\"; for example, \"Yours truly\". In the United Kingdom, \"Yours sincerely\" or \"Yours faithfully\" are most common.\nModern versions.\n\"Yours sincerely\" is used when the person sending the letter knows the name of the person receiving the letter.\n\"Yours faithfully\" is used when the person who is receiving the letter is not known by name (i.e. the recipient is addressed by a phrase such as \"Dear Sir/Madam\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Phrase","surface_form":"phrase","offset":57},{"uri":"Goodbye","surface_form":"goodbye","offset":76},{"uri":"Letter_(paper)","surface_form":"letter","offset":100},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":182},{"uri":"Signature","surface_form":"signature","offset":279},{"uri":"Respect","surface_form":"respect","offset":342},{"uri":"Regard","surface_form":"regard","offset":353},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":407},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":509}]}
