In 1900 Mandelstam entered the prestigious Tenishevsky school, which also counts Vladimir Nabokov and other significant figures of Russian (and Soviet) culture among its alumni. His first poems were printed in the school's almanac in 1907.\nIn April 1908 Mandelstam decided to enter the Sorbonne to study literature and philosophy, but he left the following year to attend the University of Heidelberg. In 1911, in order to continue education in the University of St. Petersburg, he converted to Methodism (which he did not practice) and entered the university the same year.\nMandelstam's poetry, acutely populist in spirit after the first Russian revolution, became closely associated with symbolist imagery, and in 1911 he and several other young Russian poets formed the \"Poets' Guild\" (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u0445 \u041F\u043E\u044D\u0442\u043E\u0432, \"Tsekh Poetov\"), under the formal leadership of Nikolai Gumilyov and Sergei Gorodetsky.\nIn 1922 Mandelstam arrived in Moscow with his newlywed wife Nadezhda. At the same time his second book of poems, \"Tristia\", was published in Berlin. For several years after that, he almost completely abandoned poetry, concentrating on essays, literary criticism, memoirs (\"The Din Of Time\", Russian: \u0428\u0443\u043C \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043C\u0435\u043D\u0438, \"Shum vremeni\"; \u0424\u0435\u043E\u0434\u043E\u0441\u0438\u044F, \"Feodosiya\" \u2013 both 1925) and small-format prose (\"The Egyptian Stamp\", Russian: \u0415\u0433\u0438\u043F\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043A\u0430\u044F \u043C\u0430\u0440\u043A\u0430, \"Yegipetskaya marka\" \u2013 1928). As a day job, he translated (19 books in 6 years), then worked as a correspondent for a newspaper.\nMandelstam died in 1938 in prison.\nMandelstam's non-conformist, anti-establishment tendencies always simmered not far from the surface, and in the autumn of 1933 they broke through in the form of the famous \"Stalin Epigram\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":99},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":107},{"uri":"Essay","surface_form":"essay","offset":116},{"uri":"Warsaw","surface_form":"Warsaw","offset":149},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":167},{"uri":"Tenishevsky_school","surface_form":"Tenishevsky school","offset":225},{"uri":"Vladimir_Nabokov","surface_form":"Vladimir Nabokov","offset":263},{"uri":"Soviet","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":326},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":334},{"uri":"Alumni","surface_form":"alumni","offset":352},{"uri":"University_of_Paris","surface_form":"Sorbonne","offset":468},{"uri":"University_of_Heidelberg","surface_form":"University of Heidelberg","offset":558},{"uri":"University_of_St._Petersburg","surface_form":"University of St. Petersburg","offset":631},{"uri":"Methodism","surface_form":"Methodism","offset":677},{"uri":"Populism","surface_form":"populist","offset":786},{"uri":"Russian_Revolution_of_1905","surface_form":"first Russian revolution","offset":815},{"uri":"Symbolism_(arts)","surface_form":"symbolist","offset":872},{"uri":"Nikolai_Gumilyov","surface_form":"Nikolai Gumilyov","offset":1040},{"uri":"Sergei_Gorodetsky","surface_form":"Sergei Gorodetsky","offset":1061},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":1110},{"uri":"Nadezhda_Mandelstam","surface_form":"Nadezhda","offset":1140},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":1221},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":1673}]}
