{"id":69523,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Prefecture","text":"is a prefecture of Japan. It is part of the T\u014Dhoku region on the island of Honshu. The capital city of the prefecture is Fukushima.\nThe Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is in this prefecture. The power plant had a meltdown in March 2011. It forced many people in Fukushima to move away from their homes, especially in the Futaba District.\nHistory.\nUntil the Meiji Restoration, Fukushima prefecture was known as Mutsu Province. In 1871, the territories of eleven clans were combined into three prefectures: Fukushima, Wakamatsu and Iwaki. On August 21 in 1876, they were united to form the current Fukushima Prefecture.\nGeography.\nFukushima is the prefecture that is furthest south in the T\u014Dhoku region. It is the part of T\u014Dhoku closest to Tokyo. Tokyo is about 300 kilometres further south. Fukushima located between 37 and 38 degrees north latitude.\nFukushima is divided by mountain ranges into three regions: (from west to east) Aizu, Nakad\u014Dri, and Hamad\u014Dri. Hamad\u014Dri is on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and is the flattest and most temperate region. Nakad\u014Dri is the most important farming part of the prefecture. The capital city, Fukushima, is in this area. Aizu is a tourist destination and has many mountains, scenic lakes, forests, and snowy winters.\nEconomy.\nThe three main industries in Fukushima are manufacturing, commerce and farming.\nFukushima was the largest manufacturer in T\u014Dhoku in 2008. The industry made about 5 and a half trillion yen (\u00A55,568,600,000,000). Manufacturers relied heavily on electrical power produced locally, much of it from nuclear power stations.\nTrade, including retail businesses, was the second largest industry in 2008. It made 4.7 trillion yen (\u00A54,720,600,000,000).\nIn 2009, the prefecture produced \u00A5245,000,000,000 (245 billion yen) from farming products. About 40%, or \u00A594,800,000,000 (94 billion yen), was from rice. Fukushima was the fifth largest rice producer in the country. It also produced large amounts of vegetables, meat, and fish. The two largest agricultural producers were the cities of Fukushima and K\u014Driyama. Those two areas accounted for more than 15% of agricultural production in the prefecture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Prefecture Japan"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prefectures_of_Japan","surface_form":"prefecture","offset":5},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":19},{"uri":"T%C5%8Dhoku_region","surface_form":"T\u014Dhoku region","offset":44},{"uri":"Honshu","surface_form":"Honshu","offset":75},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital city","offset":87},{"uri":"Fukushima%2C_Fukushima","surface_form":"Fukushima","offset":121},{"uri":"Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant","surface_form":"Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant","offset":136},{"uri":"Nuclear_meltdown","surface_form":"meltdown","offset":219},{"uri":"Meiji_Restoration","surface_form":"Meiji Restoration","offset":363},{"uri":"Mutsu_Province","surface_form":"Mutsu Province","offset":416},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":744},{"uri":"Aizu","surface_form":"Aizu","offset":936},{"uri":"Nakad%C5%8Dri","surface_form":"Nakad\u014Dri","offset":942},{"uri":"Hamad%C5%8Dri","surface_form":"Hamad\u014Dri","offset":956},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":998},{"uri":"Fukushima%2C_Fukushima","surface_form":"Fukushima","offset":1140},{"uri":"Manufacturing","surface_form":"manufacturing","offset":1316},{"uri":"Commerce","surface_form":"commerce","offset":1331},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":1344},{"uri":"Trillion","surface_form":"trillion","offset":1448},{"uri":"Japanese_yen","surface_form":"yen","offset":1457},{"uri":"Nuclear_power","surface_form":"nuclear power","offset":1566},{"uri":"Retail","surface_form":"retail","offset":1607},{"uri":"Rice","surface_form":"rice","offset":1862},{"uri":"Fukushima%2C_Fukushima","surface_form":"Fukushima","offset":2050},{"uri":"K%C5%8Driyama%2C_Fukushima","surface_form":"K\u014Driyama","offset":2064}]}
