{"id":695417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocos_plate","text":"The Cocos plate is a geologically young oceanic tectonic plate. It is beneath the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Central America. Cocos Island rides on it.\nThe Cocos plate was created about 23 million years ago when a larger plate broke into two pieces. The other piece became the Nazca plate. The Cocos plate also broke into two pieces, creating the small Rivera plate.\nThe Cocos plate touches several different plates. To the northeast it touches the North American plate and the Caribbean plate. To the west it touches the Pacific plate and to the south the Nazca plate.\nThis complicated set of little plates is caused by what geologists call the \"Cocos-Nazca spreading system\". The leading edge is subducting (going under existing plates). This causes the Central American Volcanic Arc.\nThe Cocos Plate is near the Galapagos hotspot, which caused the Galapagos Islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tectonic_plate","surface_form":"tectonic plate","offset":48},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":82},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":118},{"uri":"Cocos_Island","surface_form":"Cocos Island","offset":135},{"uri":"Nazca_plate","surface_form":"Nazca plate","offset":286},{"uri":"Rivera_plate","surface_form":"Rivera plate","offset":362},{"uri":"North_American_plate","surface_form":"North American plate","offset":458},{"uri":"Caribbean_plate","surface_form":"Caribbean plate","offset":487},{"uri":"Pacific_plate","surface_form":"Pacific plate","offset":531},{"uri":"Nazca_plate","surface_form":"Nazca plate","offset":566},{"uri":"Subduction","surface_form":"subducting","offset":707},{"uri":"Central_American_Volcanic_Arc","surface_form":"Central American Volcanic Arc","offset":765},{"uri":"Hotspot_(geology)","surface_form":"hotspot","offset":834},{"uri":"Galapagos_Islands","surface_form":"Galapagos Islands","offset":860}]}
