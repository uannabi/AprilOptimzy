{"id":69546,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatoire_de_Paris","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Conservatoire de Paris (Paris Conservatoire) is a music conservatory where students can study dance, drama and music. It has now been split into two \"Conservatoires\". One is for Acting, Theatre and Drama and is called the \"Conservatoire National Sup\u00E9rieur d'Art Dramatique\" (CNSAD). It is in the old building in the centre of Paris. The other is called \"Conservatoire National Sup\u00E9rieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris\". It is farther from the centre of the city. This is where Music and Dance are taught.\nThe Paris Conservatoire has been famous for music since it was formed in 1795. Nearly all famous French composers and performing musicians studied there, and many young musicians came from abroad to study. It was, and still is, one of the best places to study music in the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_conservatory","surface_form":"music conservatory","offset":67},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":111},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":118},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":128},{"uri":"1795","surface_form":"1795","offset":596},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":620},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":627}]}
