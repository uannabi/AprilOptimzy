{"id":69551,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix_de_Rome","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Prix de Rome was a scholarship (money prize) for art students in Paris. It was created in 1663 in France when Louis XIV was reigning. Every year the prize was given to promising young painters, sculptors, and architects. They had to finish a very difficult piece of work to show that they deserved to win the prize. The person who won the prize would get money so that he could go to Rome for a year to study. Sometimes they were allowed to stay longer if they were doing exceptionally good work.\nIn 1803, music was added to the subjects, and in 1804 engraving was added. Sometimes people won \u201Csecond prize\u201D which allowed them to study for a shorter period.\nMany artists who won the Prix de Rome are now almost forgotten. On the other hand, there are many artists who became very famous but did not win the Prix de Rome. These people include Augustin Pajou Eug\u00E8ne Delacroix, Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas and the composers Ernest Chausson and Maurice Ravel. Ravel tried five times to win it. There was a big argument about this at the Paris Conservatoire, and rules were reorganized after that.\nThe Prix de Rome continued to be awarded until 1968 when it was stopped.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":36},{"uri":"The_arts","surface_form":"art","offset":66},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":82},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":115},{"uri":"Louis_XIV","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":127},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":201},{"uri":"Sculptor","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":211},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":226},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":401},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":523},{"uri":"Engraving","surface_form":"engraving","offset":568},{"uri":"Augustin_Pajou","surface_form":"Augustin Pajou","offset":859},{"uri":"Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix","surface_form":"Eug\u00E8ne Delacroix","offset":874},{"uri":"Edouard_Manet","surface_form":"Edouard Manet","offset":892},{"uri":"Edgar_Degas","surface_form":"Edgar Degas","offset":907},{"uri":"Ernest_Chausson","surface_form":"Ernest Chausson","offset":937},{"uri":"Maurice_Ravel","surface_form":"Maurice Ravel","offset":957},{"uri":"Argument","surface_form":"argument","offset":1022},{"uri":"Paris_Conservatoire","surface_form":"Paris Conservatoire","offset":1049}]}
