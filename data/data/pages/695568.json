{"id":695568,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_New_Democratic_Party","text":"The New Democratic Party of British Columbia (BC NDP) is a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. It is a social democratic party and is considered to be centre-left. John Horgan has been the leader of the party since 2014. The party is a part of the federal New Democratic Party.\nThe party is the one governing the province right now. This is because there was a hung parliament after the 2017 elections and the BC Liberal Party did not win a motion of no confidence in the legislature. Instead, the BC NDP began a confidence and supply deal with the BC Green Party to form a minority government. Before that, the party governed British Columbia under six different premiers. They also won a majority government three times, in 1971, 1991, and 1996.\n2014\u2013present: Horgan as leader.\nThe leader before 2014 was Adrian Dix. He resigned from being the leader of the BC NDP in 2013. Because of this, there was an election in the party in 2014 to decide who would be the next leader. John Horgan was elected by acclamation (when there are no other candidates). Because he became leader, he also became the Leader of the Opposition in the legislature.\nThe first election that the NDP took part in while Horgan was the leader was the 2017 general election. The NDP won 41 seats in the election. The other parties that won seats were the Liberal Party (43 seats) and the Green Party (3 seats). The Liberal Party did not win enough seats to form a majority government so the first minority government in BC in 65 years was elected. This was a very close election. The Liberals won the popular vote by only 1566 votes. Because both parties did not have enough seats to form a majority government, the Greens held the balance of power. Both the Liberals and NDP began negotiating with the Greens to see if they would support a minority government by either of the parties. On 29 May, Horgan and the Greens announced that the Greens would support the NDPs in a confidence and supply deal. The Liberals lost a vote of no confidence vote by two votes to the Greens and NDP. Because of this, the Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon asked Horgan to form government and become the next premier. Horgan became the first NDP premier in 16 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Provinces_of_Canada","surface_form":"provincial","offset":59},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":70},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":89},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":107},{"uri":"Social_democracy","surface_form":"social democratic","offset":123},{"uri":"Centre-left_politics","surface_form":"centre-left","offset":171},{"uri":"John_Horgan","surface_form":"John Horgan","offset":184},{"uri":"Federal","surface_form":"federal","offset":268},{"uri":"New_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"New Democratic Party","offset":276},{"uri":"Hung_parliament","surface_form":"hung parliament","offset":381},{"uri":"2017_British_Columbia_general_election","surface_form":"2017 elections","offset":407},{"uri":"British_Columbia_Liberal_Party","surface_form":"BC Liberal Party","offset":430},{"uri":"Motion_of_no_confidence","surface_form":"motion of no confidence","offset":461},{"uri":"Legistlative_Assembly_of_British_Columbia","surface_form":"legislature","offset":492},{"uri":"Confidence_and_supply","surface_form":"confidence and supply","offset":533},{"uri":"British_Columbia_Green_Party","surface_form":"BC Green Party","offset":569},{"uri":"Minority_government","surface_form":"minority government","offset":594},{"uri":"Premier_of_British_Columbia","surface_form":"premiers","offset":684},{"uri":"Majority_government","surface_form":"majority government","offset":710},{"uri":"Adrian_Dix","surface_form":"Adrian Dix","offset":827},{"uri":"Resign","surface_form":"resign","offset":842},{"uri":"Acclamation","surface_form":"acclamation","offset":1023},{"uri":"Candidate","surface_form":"candidate","offset":1060},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Opposition_(British_Columbia)","surface_form":"Leader of the Opposition","offset":1118},{"uri":"2017_British_Columbia_general_election","surface_form":"2017 general election","offset":1244},{"uri":"Majority_government","surface_form":"majority government","offset":1456},{"uri":"Minority_government","surface_form":"minority government","offset":1489},{"uri":"Popular_vote","surface_form":"popular vote","offset":1593},{"uri":"Balance_of_power_(parliament)","surface_form":"balance of power","offset":1724},{"uri":"Negotiate","surface_form":"negotiating","offset":1774},{"uri":"Lieutenant_Governor_of_British_Columbia","surface_form":"Lieutenant Governor","offset":2098},{"uri":"Judith_Guichon","surface_form":"Judith Guichon","offset":2118}]}
