{"id":695624,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_gregorii","text":"\"Adansonia gregorii\", commonly known as the boab, is a tree in the family Malvaceae. Its trunk has a swollen base, which makes it easily recognizable. For this reason it is also called bottle tree. It is endemic to Australia, where it mostly occurs in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, east into Northern Territory, parts of western Queensland, and New South Wales.\nThere are other species of baobabs, which are native to Madagascar (six species) and mainland Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (one species).\nBoab ranges from 5 to 15 metres in height, usually between 9 and 12 metres, with a broad bottle-shaped trunk. Its trunk base may be extremely large; trunks with a diameter of over five metres have been recorded. \"A. gregorii\" is deciduous, losing its leaves during the dry winter period and producing new leaves and large white flowers between December and May.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":67},{"uri":"Malvaceae","surface_form":"Malvaceae","offset":74},{"uri":"Endemism","surface_form":"endemic","offset":204},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":215},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":276},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":305},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":342},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":358},{"uri":"Baobab","surface_form":"baobabs","offset":402},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":431},{"uri":"Arabian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Arabian Peninsula","offset":484},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":746}]}
