{"id":695762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels","text":"=\"preserve\">Gulliver's Travels is a book written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift. It is a satire about human nature\u2014how humans act\u2014and was very popular. It is about a man named Gulliver who goes to a place with very tiny people that are less than 6 inches tall.\nThe book was an immediate success. John Gay said that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery\".\nAfter many scientists have tried to calculate the approximate height of Gulliver, the closest result has come from Townsville, Australia with an approximate height of Gulliver 14.79647688 metres tall.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jonathan_Swift","surface_form":"Jonathan Swift","offset":60},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":84},{"uri":"Human_nature","surface_form":"human nature","offset":97},{"uri":"Townsville","surface_form":"Townsville","offset":492},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":504}]}
