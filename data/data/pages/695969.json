She worked in the field of numerical analysis and dynamical systems. Raugel worked for Centre national de la recherche scientifique, University of Rennes 1, \u00C9cole Polytechnique and at University of Paris-Sud.\nIn the mid-1980s, she started working on the dynamics of evolution equations, in particular on global attractors, perturbations, and Navier-Stokes equations on thin domains, where she was recognized a world-expert.\nRaugel died on 10 May 2019 at the age of 68.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Centre_national_de_la_recherche_scientifique","surface_form":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique","offset":160},{"uri":"University_of_Rennes_1","surface_form":"University of Rennes 1","offset":206},{"uri":"%C3%89cole_Polytechnique","surface_form":"\u00C9cole Polytechnique","offset":230},{"uri":"University_of_Paris-Sud","surface_form":"University of Paris-Sud","offset":257},{"uri":"Attractor","surface_form":"attractor","offset":384},{"uri":"Perturbations","surface_form":"perturbations","offset":396},{"uri":"Navier-Stokes_equation","surface_form":"Navier-Stokes equation","offset":415}]}
