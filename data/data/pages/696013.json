{"id":696013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumont_d%27Urville_Station","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dumont d'Urville Station () is a French scientific station in Antarctica. It is on \u00CEle des P\u00E9trels, archipelago of Pointe-G\u00E9ologie in Ad\u00E9lie Land. It is named after explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville. His expedition landed on D\u00E9barquement Rock in the Dumoulin Islands at the northeast end of the archipelago on January 21, 1840. The station is run by the \"French Polar Institute Paul-\u00C9mile Victor\".\nHistory.\nThe first French Antarctic research station was at Port Martin, east of D'Urville. It was destroyed by fire on January 23, 1952. In 1952, a small base called Base Marret, was built on \u00CEle des P\u00E9trels to study a rookery of emperor penguins. When the Port Martin station was destroyed, Base Marret was used in the winter of 1952/1953. A new main base, Dumont D'Urville station, was built on the same island and opened on January 12, 1956. This became the centre for French scientific research during the Antarctic International Geophysical Year 1957/1958. It has remained in active use ever since.\nThe station allows 30-40 people to come ashore at one time. Ice and strong katabatic winds often prevent landings, either by boat or by helicopter. The station can accommodate about 30 people in winter and 120 during the summer. The icebreaker ship \"L'Astrolabe\" carries supplies and people to the station from the port of Hobart, Tasmania. It does five trips between November and March.\nThe Academy Award-winning documentary movie \"La Marche de l'empereur\", in English \"March of the Penguins\", was filmed in the region around this base.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":50},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":79},{"uri":"Geologie_Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago of Pointe-G\u00E9ologie","offset":117},{"uri":"Ad%C3%A9lie_Land","surface_form":"Ad\u00E9lie Land","offset":151},{"uri":"Exploration","surface_form":"explorer","offset":182},{"uri":"Jules_Dumont_d%27Urville","surface_form":"Jules Dumont d'Urville","offset":191},{"uri":"D%C3%A9barquement_Rock","surface_form":"D\u00E9barquement Rock","offset":240},{"uri":"Dumoulin_Islands","surface_form":"Dumoulin Islands","offset":265},{"uri":"Port_Martin","surface_form":"Port Martin","offset":473},{"uri":"Rookery","surface_form":"rookery","offset":633},{"uri":"Emperor_penguin","surface_form":"emperor penguin","offset":644},{"uri":"International_Geophysical_Year","surface_form":"International Geophysical Year","offset":934},{"uri":"Katabatic_wind","surface_form":"katabatic wind","offset":1093},{"uri":"Inflatable_boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":1143},{"uri":"Helicopter","surface_form":"helicopter","offset":1154},{"uri":"Icebreaker","surface_form":"icebreaker","offset":1251},{"uri":"L%27Astrolabe_(2016_icebreaker)","surface_form":"\"L'Astrolabe\"","offset":1267},{"uri":"Hobart","surface_form":"Hobart","offset":1341},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":1349},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":1410},{"uri":"Documentary","surface_form":"documentary movie","offset":1432},{"uri":"March_of_the_Penguins","surface_form":"March of the Penguins","offset":1489}]}
