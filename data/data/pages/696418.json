Ryden was commissioned in the fall of 1987 to create a figurative sculpture as a memorial to the life of Dr. King. Born in Chicago, Ryden is one of the most accomplished sculptors in the Midwest. Working primarily in bronze, his works range from compelling abstractions to lifelike renderings. Ryden earned a Masters of Fine Art Degree from the University of Kansas, and he completed his post-graduate work in Europe. Ryden is a prolific sculptor, and has created an extensive body of work including bronze memorials honoring: \"Frank O\u2019Bannon\" (bust), located in the Indiana Statehouse rotunda (Indianapolis, IN); \"Carl Erskine\" (statue) at St. John\u2019s Hospital (Anderson, IN); and \"Far-Reaching Goals\", a statue of \"Jumping Johnny Wilson\" located at Anderson High School (Anderson, IN). Other noteworthy Ryden sculptures include \"Crucible of Peace\", \"The Beloved\", and \"The Graces\" \u2013 all located in Anderson, Indiana. Ryden currently works as a self-employed fine artist, and artist-in-residence at Anderson University. He is a resident of Yorktown, Indiana.\nSpeaking of his sculptural rendering of Dr. King, Ryden said \u201CI saw Dr. King in a proactive way \u2014 not only did he speak about the rights of individuals, he took action to bring attention to the cause. I wanted to pick a pose that showed him in this proactive approach, so I created him in a motion of striding forward.\u201D","categories":[],"infobox_types":["artwork"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anderson%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Anderson, Indiana","offset":181}]}
