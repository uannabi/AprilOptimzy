{"id":696542,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_calendar","text":"The World Calendar is a variation of the of the Gregorian calendar. It was created by Elisabeth Achelis of Brooklyn, New York in 1930.\nFeatures.\nThe World Calendar is a 12-month, perennial calendar with 4 seasonal quarters.\nEach quarter begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday. The quarters lengths are same: each has exactly 91 days, 13 weeks or 3 months. The three months have 31, 30, 30 days respectively.\nThe World Calendar also has two extra days outside of the week to keep the new year days as same as the Gregorian calendar.\nCriticism.\nThe main critics of The World Calendar are the leaders of religions that worship according to a seven-day cycle.\nJews worship on Saturday, as in the Hebrew Bible: \"Keep in memory the Sabbath and let it be a holy day\" (8). Christians worship on Sunday on which they believe Jesus was resurrected. Muslims worship on Friday on which they believe Adam was created. With the World calendar, their worship would change from year to year. So, the United Nations rejected the calendar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":48},{"uri":"Elisabeth_Achelis","surface_form":"Elisabeth Achelis","offset":86},{"uri":"Brooklyn","surface_form":"Brooklyn","offset":107},{"uri":"Perennial","surface_form":"perennial","offset":179},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"seasonal quarters","offset":205},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":511},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worship","offset":615},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":655},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worship","offset":660},{"uri":"Shabbat","surface_form":"Saturday","offset":671},{"uri":"Hebrew_Bible","surface_form":"Hebrew Bible","offset":691},{"uri":"8","surface_form":"8","offset":760},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":764},{"uri":"Sabbath_in_Christianity","surface_form":"Sunday","offset":786},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":815},{"uri":"Resurrection_of_Jesus","surface_form":"resurrected","offset":825},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":838},{"uri":"Jumu%27ah","surface_form":"Friday","offset":857},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":983}]}
