Migrants from the north who wanted to trade with the Portuguese in the south founded the kingom.\nIt was ruled by a king called a Bai or Obai. The sub-kingdoms within the state were ruled by nobles titled \"Gbana\". The Koya Kingdom kept and maintained diplomatic relations with the British and French in the 18th century. Children of Temne nobles were allowed to get western educations abroad. Koya also traded with Islamic states to its north and had Muslims within its borders.\nUnder Nembanga's reign (1775\u20131793), the Koya kingdom signed a treaty which made it possible for the establishment of a British colony on the peninsula of Sierra Leone in 1788.\nKoya participated in the trans-atlantic slave trade, though sources state that such commerce was much more privatized than in other kingdoms.

Koya lost the northern shoreline of Sierra Leone to the British and Port Loko to the Susu. However, they remained a power in the region.

In response to a British bombardment, the kingdom expelled the Church Missionary Society missionaries operating at Magbela in 1860.\nThe kingdom became a British protectorate August 31, 1896.
