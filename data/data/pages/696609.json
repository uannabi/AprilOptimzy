{"id":696609,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchagua_(historical_province)","text":"The historical province of Colchagua was one of the regions of Chile, between 1826 and 1976. Its capital was located in San Fernando during most of its existence. For some years, Curic\u00F3 and Rancagua were capitals of Colchagua.\nHistory.\nThe province of Colchagua was one of the former, primitive eight provinces of Chile (Coquimbo, Aconcagua, Santiago, Colchagua, Maule, Concepci\u00F3n, Valdivia, and Chilo\u00E9) created by the federal laws of 31 January 1826. Its territory comprised former delegations of Colchagua, Curic\u00F3 and Talca. The province was sanctioned by the 1828 Constitution.\nDuring its early years, Colchagua was divided into the departments of San Fernando (cap. San Fernando), Curic\u00F3 (cap. Curic\u00F3), and Talca (cap. Talca).\nIn 1833, a new Constitution reorganized the country, creating departments, subdelegations and districts as lower entities of provinces. Later that year, by law dated August, the department of Talca was separated to create the province of Talca, and in 1834, the department of Caupolic\u00E1n was created, with Rengo as its capital.\nAlthough the title of provincial capital was disputed by San Fernando, Curic\u00F3 and Talca, depending on the desired residence of the intendant, a September 1840 decree established San Fernando as the definitive capital.\nIn 1865, the department of Curic\u00F3 was separated from Colchagua, in order to create the province of Curic\u00F3.\nOn 17 September 1925, by Law Decree N.\u00B0 529, the department of San Vicente was created, separated from Caupolic\u00E1n.\nIn 1928, the government of Carlos Ib\u00E1\u00F1ez del Campo decided to reorganize the provinces of Chile, by Decree with Law Force N.\u00B0 8.582 dated 28 January 1929. The new province of Colchagua incorporated the departments of Rancagua (cap. Rancagua) and Cachapoal (cap. Peumo), originally from the province of O'Higgins, and the department of Santa Cruz (cap. Santa Cruz), which belonged to the province of Curic\u00F3.\nBecause of public discontent, the former provinces of O'Higgins and Colchagua were re-established by Law 5.376, in January 1934. Colchagua kept the departments of San Fernando and Santa Cruz. In 1973, under the government of Salvador Allende, the department of Cardenal Caro was created (cap. Marchig\u00FCe).\nIn July 1974, a new reform took place, directed by the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who created regions. On 1 January 1976, the new VI Regi\u00F3n (Sixth Region) came into existence, with the territory of former provinces of O'Higgins and Colchagua. Former departments of San Fernando, Santa Cruz and Cardenal Caro were supressed. In 1979, the region was renamed VI Regi\u00F3n del Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins (Sixth Region of Liberator General Bernardo O'Higgins, in short, Region of O'Higgins). Its territory comprises current provinces of Cachapoal, Colchagua and Cardenal Caro.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":63},{"uri":"1826","surface_form":"1826","offset":78},{"uri":"1976","surface_form":"1976","offset":87},{"uri":"San_Fernando%2C_Chile","surface_form":"San Fernando","offset":120},{"uri":"Curic%C3%B3","surface_form":"Curic\u00F3","offset":179},{"uri":"Rancagua","surface_form":"Rancagua","offset":190},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":314},{"uri":"1828","surface_form":"1828","offset":562},{"uri":"Department_of_San_Fernando","surface_form":"San Fernando","offset":651},{"uri":"San_Fernando%2C_Chile","surface_form":"San Fernando","offset":670},{"uri":"Department_of_Curic%C3%B3","surface_form":"Curic\u00F3","offset":685},{"uri":"Curic%C3%B3","surface_form":"Curic\u00F3","offset":698},{"uri":"Department_of_Talca","surface_form":"Talca","offset":711},{"uri":"Talca","surface_form":"Talca","offset":723},{"uri":"1833","surface_form":"1833","offset":734},{"uri":"Talca_(historical_province)","surface_form":"province of Talca","offset":957},{"uri":"1834","surface_form":"1834","offset":983},{"uri":"Department_of_Caupolic%C3%A1n","surface_form":"department of Caupolic\u00E1n","offset":993},{"uri":"Rengo","surface_form":"Rengo","offset":1036},{"uri":"1840","surface_form":"1840","offset":1212},{"uri":"1865","surface_form":"1865","offset":1279},{"uri":"Curic%C3%B3_(historical_province)","surface_form":"province of Curic\u00F3","offset":1363},{"uri":"September_17","surface_form":"17 September","offset":1386},{"uri":"1925","surface_form":"1925","offset":1399},{"uri":"Department_of_San_Vicente","surface_form":"department of San Vicente","offset":1432},{"uri":"1928","surface_form":"1928","offset":1501},{"uri":"Carlos_Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez_del_Campo","surface_form":"Carlos Ib\u00E1\u00F1ez del Campo","offset":1525},{"uri":"January_28","surface_form":"28 January","offset":1636},{"uri":"1929","surface_form":"1929","offset":1647},{"uri":"Department_of_Rancagua","surface_form":"Rancagua","offset":1715},{"uri":"Rancagua","surface_form":"Rancagua","offset":1730},{"uri":"Department_of_Cachapoal","surface_form":"Cachapoal","offset":1744},{"uri":"Peumo","surface_form":"Peumo","offset":1760},{"uri":"O%27Higgins_(historical_province)","surface_form":"province of O'Higgins","offset":1788},{"uri":"Department_of_Santa_Cruz","surface_form":"department of Santa Cruz","offset":1819},{"uri":"Santa_Cruz%2C_Chile","surface_form":"Santa Cruz","offset":1850},{"uri":"1934","surface_form":"1934","offset":2028},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":2100},{"uri":"Salvador_Allende","surface_form":"Salvador Allende","offset":2130},{"uri":"Department_of_Cardenal_Caro","surface_form":"department of Cardenal Caro","offset":2152},{"uri":"Marchig%C3%BCe","surface_form":"Marchig\u00FCe","offset":2198},{"uri":"1974","surface_form":"1974","offset":2218},{"uri":"Augusto_Pinochet","surface_form":"Augusto Pinochet","offset":2290},{"uri":"January_1","surface_form":"1 January","offset":2332},{"uri":"1976","surface_form":"1976","offset":2342},{"uri":"O%27Higgins_Region","surface_form":"VI Regi\u00F3n (Sixth Region)","offset":2356},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":2553},{"uri":"Cachapoal_Province","surface_form":"Cachapoal","offset":2766},{"uri":"Colchagua_Province","surface_form":"Colchagua","offset":2777},{"uri":"Cardenal_Caro","surface_form":"Cardenal Caro","offset":2791}]}
