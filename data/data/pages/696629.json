Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. Houthi forces currently controlling the capital Sana\u02BDa, allied with forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have clashed with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. On 21 March 2015, after taking over Sana\u02BDa and the Yemeni government, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces. The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government. Hadi fled the country the same day. At the same time, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes to restore the former Yemeni government. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the campaign.\nAccording to the UN and other sources, from March 2015 to December 2017, between 8,670\u201313,600 people were killed in Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians. They estimated more than 50,000 have died as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. With Iran suporting the Huthi and Saudi Arabia opposing them, the conflict has been widely seen as a proxy war and a means for Saudi Arabia to combat Iranian influence in the region.\nIn 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become \"the worst famine in the world in 100 years.\" The international community sharply condemned the Saudi Arabian-led bombing campaign, which included widespread bombing of civilian areas. The bombing campaign has killed or injured an estimated 17,729 civilians as of March 2019 according to the Yemen Data Project. Despite this, the crisis gained less international media attention than the Syrian civil war. The US has been providing bombs to aid the Saudi forces and airstrikes in Yemen. In March 2019, this led the US senate to pass a resolution to end US support of Saudi Arabia. It was vetoed by President of the United States Donald Trump, and in May, the Senate failed to override the veto.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen","surface_form":"Saudi-led coalition","offset":0},{"uri":"Special_Forces_(United_States_Army)","surface_form":"Green Berets","offset":20},{"uri":"French_Army_Special_Forces_Command","surface_form":"French Army Special Forces Command","offset":33},{"uri":"Southern_Transitional_Council","surface_form":"Southern Transitional Council","offset":68},{"uri":"Tareq_Saleh","surface_form":"Tareq Saleh","offset":110},{"uri":"Ansar_al-Sharia_(Yemen)","surface_form":"Ansar al-Sharia","offset":141},{"uri":"Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_%E2%80%93_Yemen_Province","surface_form":"ISIL-YP","offset":157},{"uri":"Salman_of_Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"King Salman","offset":165},{"uri":"Mohammad_bin_Salman_Al_Saud","surface_form":"Muhammad bin Salman","offset":177},{"uri":"Mohammed_bin_Zayed_Al_Nahyan","surface_form":"Mohammed bin Zayed","offset":197},{"uri":"Tamim_bin_Hamad_Al_Thani","surface_form":"Tamim bin Hamad","offset":216},{"uri":"Abdel_Fattah_Abdelrahman_Burhan","surface_form":"Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan","offset":242},{"uri":"Macky_Sall","surface_form":"Macky Sall","offset":274},{"uri":"Mohammed_VI_of_Morocco","surface_form":"Mohamed VI","offset":285},{"uri":"Abu_Bilal_al-Harbi","surface_form":"Abu Bilal al-Harbi","offset":306},{"uri":"List_of_aviation_shootdowns_and_accidents_during_the_Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen","surface_form":"aircraft lost","offset":360},{"uri":"List_of_aviation_shootdowns_and_accidents_during_the_Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen","surface_form":"helicopters lost","offset":377},{"uri":"M1_Abrams","surface_form":"M1A2S","offset":396},{"uri":"HSV-2_Swift","surface_form":"HSV-2 \"Swift\"","offset":503},{"uri":"General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon","surface_form":"F-16","offset":565},{"uri":"General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon","surface_form":"F-16","offset":582},{"uri":"Academi","surface_form":"Academi","offset":592},{"uri":"Private_military_company","surface_form":"PMCs","offset":604},{"uri":"Save_the_Children","surface_form":"Save the Children","offset":658},{"uri":"2016%E2%80%9318_Yemen_cholera_outbreak","surface_form":"cholera outbreak","offset":708},{"uri":"Abd_Rabbuh_Mansur_Hadi","surface_form":"Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi","offset":840},{"uri":"Houthi","surface_form":"Houthi","offset":892},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":1007},{"uri":"Sana%27a","surface_form":"Sana\u02BDa","offset":1062},{"uri":"Ali_Abdullah_Saleh","surface_form":"Ali Abdullah Saleh","offset":1119},{"uri":"Aden","surface_form":"Aden","offset":1199},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda_in_the_Arabian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula","offset":1205},{"uri":"Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","surface_form":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","offset":1254},{"uri":"Lahij_Governorate","surface_form":"Lahij Governorate","offset":1744},{"uri":"Lahij","surface_form":"Lahij","offset":1776},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":1956},{"uri":"Yemeni_government","surface_form":"Yemeni government","offset":2041},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2064},{"uri":"UN","surface_form":"UN","offset":2158},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":2369},{"uri":"Proxy_war","surface_form":"proxy war","offset":2493},{"uri":"Syrian_civil_war","surface_form":"Syrian civil war","offset":3076},{"uri":"US_senate","surface_form":"US senate","offset":3203},{"uri":"Veto","surface_form":"veto","offset":3276},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":3286},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":3317}]}
