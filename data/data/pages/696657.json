The tour was created to promote her eighth studio album, \"Fever\" (2001). It began in Cardiff, Wales on 26 April 2002 and ended on 16 August 2002 in Melbourne, Australia.\nBackground.\nAt the time, KylieFever2002 was the biggest tour Minogue had created. The album and its music videos were able to provide and inspire multiple stage sets and costume changes. It also had a much larger budget than past tours, due to the success of the album and its singles.\nThe tour was sponsored by Evian, a brand of mineral water, and Vodafone, a mobile phone network operator. At each of the shows in the United Kingdom, Evian provided free bottles of their water with the name 'Kylie' written on them.\nA special webcast of a show at the Manchester Evening News Arena was shown on MSN UK live for fans across the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music_tour","surface_form":"concert tour","offset":31},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":47},{"uri":"Kylie_Minogue","surface_form":"Kylie Minogue","offset":65},{"uri":"Promotion","surface_form":"promote","offset":104},{"uri":"Fever_(Kylie_Minogue_album)","surface_form":"\"Fever\"","offset":137},{"uri":"Cardiff","surface_form":"Cardiff","offset":165},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":174},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":228},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":239},{"uri":"Sponsor","surface_form":"sponsor","offset":549},{"uri":"Mineral_water","surface_form":"mineral water","offset":580},{"uri":"Vodafone","surface_form":"Vodafone","offset":599},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":670},{"uri":"Webcast","surface_form":"webcast","offset":778},{"uri":"Manchester_Arena","surface_form":"Manchester Evening News Arena","offset":803},{"uri":"MSN","surface_form":"MSN UK","offset":846}]}
