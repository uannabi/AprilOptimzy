In other words, it is a way of integrating along the complex plane.\nMore specifically, given a complex-valued function formula_1 and a contour formula_1, the contour integral of formula_1 along formula_1 is written as formula_1 or formula_1.\nCalculating contour integrals with the residue theorem.\nFor a standard contour integral, we can evaluate it by using the residue theorem. This theorem states that\nformula_1\nwhere formula_1 is the residue of the function formula_1, formula_1 is the contour located on the complex plane. Here, formula_1 is the integrand of the function, or part of the integral to be integrated.\nThe following examples illustrate how contour integrals can be calculated using the residue theorem.\nMultivariable contour integrals.\nformula_1\nIn addition, we also need to evaluate formula_1, where formula_1 is an alternate notation of formula_1. The divergence of any dimension can be described as\nThe following examples illustrate the use of divergence theorem in the calculation of multivariate contour integrals.\nExample 1.\nLet the vector field formula_1 be bounded by the following conditions\nformula_1\nExample 2.\nThus, we can evaluate a contour integral of the fourth dimension.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Complex_analysis","surface_form":"complex analysis","offset":3},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integral","offset":66},{"uri":"Complex_plane","surface_form":"complex plane","offset":99},{"uri":"Residue_theorem","surface_form":"residue theorem","offset":477},{"uri":"Residue","surface_form":"residue","offset":552},{"uri":"Contour","surface_form":"contour","offset":604},{"uri":"Complex_plane","surface_form":"complex plane","offset":627},{"uri":"Integrand","surface_form":"integrand","offset":665},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integral","offset":707},{"uri":"Divergence","surface_form":"divergence","offset":986},{"uri":"Vector_field","surface_form":"vector field","offset":1171}]}
