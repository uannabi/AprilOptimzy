{"id":69687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Music","text":"e=\"preserve\">: \"For the institution founded in London in 1719 for putting on performances of operas see George Frideric Handel.\"\nThe Royal Academy of Music is a conservatory in London where young people can study music. It was founded in 1822. Many musicians who became famous studied music at the Royal Academy of Music.\nThe Royal Academy of Music was officially founded (started) in 1822 and was opened the next year. King George IV was the patron of the conservatory. At first it had 21 students.\nIn 1830 it received its Royal Charter, but for many years it had financial problems and it was not until 1868, when the British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone arranged for it to have a regular grant, that it began to do well. During the 19th century the Academy was in Hanover Square, but in 1912 it moved to Marylebone Road near Regent's Park.\nSince 1912 many changes and extensions have been made to the building. Many concerts are given in the Duke\u2019s Hall and operas are performed in the Sir Jack Lyons Theatre. Many of the professors (teachers) at the Academy come from other countries. The Academy works together with King\u2019s College, London where many of the students take a 4 year performance course. In 1997 they won some lottery money which helped them to get a new building for their collection of musical instruments. It has a large library which includes all the books and music which used to belong to the conductors Sir Henry Wood and Otto Klemperer.\nToday the students come from over 50 countries. Students from abroad can attend a special \u201CEnglish for Musicians\u201D course. There are over 600 students at the Academy. The students have many opportunities to perform, both in the Academy and in concerts in other places. Over 90% of the students find a career in music after they leave the Academy.\nThe principal of the Royal Academy of Music is Jonathan Freeman-Attwood.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1719","surface_form":"1719","offset":57},{"uri":"George_Frideric_Handel","surface_form":"George Frideric Handel","offset":104},{"uri":"Conservatoire","surface_form":"conservatory","offset":161},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":177},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":213},{"uri":"1822","surface_form":"1822","offset":238},{"uri":"George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"King George IV","offset":420},{"uri":"Patron","surface_form":"patron","offset":443},{"uri":"Royal_Charter","surface_form":"Royal Charter","offset":524},{"uri":"William_Ewart_Gladstone","surface_form":"William Ewart Gladstone","offset":643},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":745},{"uri":"1912","surface_form":"1912","offset":800},{"uri":"Regent%27s_Park","surface_form":"Regent's Park","offset":838},{"uri":"Library","surface_form":"library","offset":1351},{"uri":"Conductor_(music)","surface_form":"conductors","offset":1426},{"uri":"Henry_Wood","surface_form":"Henry Wood","offset":1441},{"uri":"Otto_Klemperer","surface_form":"Otto Klemperer","offset":1456}]}
