The place where most people live at is Parsippany-Troy Hills Township, with 53,238 people, while the largest place is Rockaway Township, at.\nHistory.\nLenape Native Americans used to live in New Jersey. They lived near rivers and hunted, fished, and got plants and nuts.\nHenry Hudson explored New Jersey in the 1600s. After he did, the Dutch came and made small towns and cities. They traded tools with the Native Americans for food and fur.\nThen, the British took over the land that the Dutch owned. They built the first towns and mines in what is now Morris County. But by 1750, there were no more Native Americans in New Jersey, because the Native Americans lost their land, grew less food, and got very sick. They all went to the Ohio Valley or Eastern Canada instead.\nMorris County was made for real in 1739, from parts of Hunterdon County. It was named after a governor named Lewis Morris.\nDuring the battles of Trenton and Princeton during the American Revolution, George Washington and his men camped here. You can still see the place where they camped today; it's called Jockey Hollow.\nGeography.\nThis county is 481.62 square miles, according to the 2010 Census.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":19},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":33},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":47},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":68},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":204},{"uri":"Morristown%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Morristown","offset":219},{"uri":"Parsippany-Troy_Hills%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Parsippany-Troy Hills Township","offset":270},{"uri":"Rockaway_Township%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Rockaway Township","offset":349},{"uri":"Lenape","surface_form":"Lenape","offset":381},{"uri":"Native_Americans","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":388},{"uri":"Henry_Hudson","surface_form":"Henry Hudson","offset":501},{"uri":"Dutch","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":566},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":682},{"uri":"Ohio_Valley","surface_form":"Ohio Valley","offset":964},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":987},{"uri":"Hunterdon_County%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Hunterdon County","offset":1058},{"uri":"Lewis_Morris","surface_form":"Lewis Morris","offset":1112},{"uri":"Trenton","surface_form":"Trenton","offset":1148},{"uri":"Princeton","surface_form":"Princeton","offset":1160},{"uri":"American_Revolution","surface_form":"American Revolution","offset":1181},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":1202},{"uri":"Jockey_Hollow","surface_form":"Jockey Hollow","offset":1310},{"uri":"2010_Census","surface_form":"2010 Census","offset":1389}]}
