{"id":697911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citypoint","text":"Citypoint (previously known as Britannic House and Britannic Tower) is a skyscraper located on Ropemaker Street on the northern part of the City of London, the main financial district and historic center of London.\nOriginally named Britannic House, Citypoint was built in 1967 as a 35-storey, tall headquarters for British Petroleum (now BP). This became the first building in the City of London area to pass the height of St Paul's Cathedral. The designers were F. Milton Cashmore and H. N. W. Grosvenor. In 1991 British Petroleum moved back to their original headquarters on Finsbury Circus and the building was renamed Britannic Tower.\nIt was refurbished in 2000, with additional floor space and the height increased to. Sheppard Robson helped to improve the building. It was then renamed to Citypoint.\nCitypoint is the seventh-tallest building in the City, after the Heron Tower, 122 Leadenhall Street, Tower 42, 30 St Mary Axe, Broadgate Tower and 20 Fenchurch Street but only the 23rd-tallest in Greater London.\nIn August 2005 its owner, Pillar Properties, sold the building for more than \u00A3500 million in one of the largest deals ever seen in the City office market.\nIn early 2007 the building was again put on the market, this time for \u00A3650 million, and purchased by a private American company called Beacon Capital Partners. At the time it was the most expensive building sale in the United Kingdom. However 8 Canada Square at Canary Wharf eclipsed this by some margin just a few months later when it was sold for over \u00A31 billion.\nA number of other large buildings are planned on sites nearby. These include a 43-storey, residential tower at Milton Court. A office tower at Ropemaker Place has also been developed by British Land.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":73},{"uri":"City_of_London","surface_form":"City of London","offset":140},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":207},{"uri":"BP","surface_form":"British Petroleum","offset":315},{"uri":"St_Paul%27s_Cathedral","surface_form":"St Paul's Cathedral","offset":423},{"uri":"Finsbury_Circus","surface_form":"Finsbury Circus","offset":577},{"uri":"Refurbish","surface_form":"refurbished","offset":646},{"uri":"Heron_Tower","surface_form":"Heron Tower","offset":871},{"uri":"122_Leadenhall_Street","surface_form":"122 Leadenhall Street","offset":884},{"uri":"Tower_42","surface_form":"Tower 42","offset":907},{"uri":"30_St_Mary_Axe","surface_form":"30 St Mary Axe","offset":917},{"uri":"Broadgate_Tower","surface_form":"Broadgate Tower","offset":933},{"uri":"20_Fenchurch_Street","surface_form":"20 Fenchurch Street","offset":953},{"uri":"Beacon_Capital_Partners","surface_form":"Beacon Capital Partners","offset":1308},{"uri":"8_Canada_Square","surface_form":"8 Canada Square","offset":1416},{"uri":"British_Land","surface_form":"British Land","offset":1725}]}
