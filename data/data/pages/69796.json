{"id":69796,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle","text":"Fin de si\u00E8cle means turn of the century in French. It is widely used for the time around 1900, but also for the closing of an old era, and the start of a new one.\nFin de si\u00E8cle is sometimes used to mean the type of art, culture and way of behaving at the end of the nineteenth century.\nThe end of the 19th century was felt to be a period of degeneration, but at the same time a period of hope for a new beginning.\nThe \"spirit\" of fin de si\u00E8cle often refers to the cultural hallmarks that were recognized as prominent in the 1880s and 1890s, including 'pessimism', and a widespread belief that civilization leads to decadence.\nThe themes of fin de si\u00E8cle political culture were very controversial and have been cited as a major influence on fascism. The major political theme of the era was that of revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society and liberal democracy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":43},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":215},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":220},{"uri":"Pessimism","surface_form":"pessimism","offset":552},{"uri":"Decadence","surface_form":"decadence","offset":615},{"uri":"Political_culture","surface_form":"political culture","offset":654},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"fascism","offset":740},{"uri":"Materialism","surface_form":"materialism","offset":813},{"uri":"Rationalism","surface_form":"rationalism","offset":826},{"uri":"Positivism","surface_form":"positivism","offset":839},{"uri":"Bourgeoisie","surface_form":"bourgeois society","offset":851},{"uri":"Liberal_democracy","surface_form":"liberal democracy","offset":873}]}
