{"id":69806,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colwyn_Bay","text":"Colwyn Bay (Welsh: Bae Colwyn) is a town, community and seaside resort on the north coast of Wales, in the Conwy County Borough.\nThe 2011 UK census revealed the community had a population of 34,284.\nThe town is dominated by the tourist trade, because of its famous beaches. Colwyn Bay is a Fairtrade Town as certified by the Fairtrade Foundation as part of the Fairtrade Towns scheme.\nThe town had a famous pier which was extremely popular with tourists and visitors. However, Victoria Pier was closed to the public in 2009 after a dispute between Conwy County Borough Council and the pier's owner led to him being declared bankrupt. In January 2017, the lower end of the pier partially collapsed into the sea and Conwy Council announced plans to dismantle and store the pier, with a view of restoring it in the future. The pier was demolished in May 2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":12},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":36},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":93},{"uri":"Conwy_County_Borough","surface_form":"Conwy County Borough","offset":107},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist","offset":228},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beaches","offset":265},{"uri":"Fairtrade_Foundation","surface_form":"Fairtrade Foundation","offset":325},{"uri":"Pier","surface_form":"pier","offset":407},{"uri":"2009","surface_form":"2009","offset":519},{"uri":"Conwy_County_Borough_Council","surface_form":"Conwy County Borough Council","offset":548},{"uri":"Bankruptcy","surface_form":"bankrupt","offset":624},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":637},{"uri":"2017","surface_form":"2017","offset":645},{"uri":"May","surface_form":"May","offset":847},{"uri":"2018","surface_form":"2018","offset":851}]}
