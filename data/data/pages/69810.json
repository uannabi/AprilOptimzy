{"id":69810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateosaurus","text":"\"Plateosaurus\" (meaning 'flat lizard') is a genus of plateosaurid prosauropod dinosaurs. They lived during the Norian and Rhaetian stages of the Upper Triassic period, around 216 to 199 million years ago in what is now Europe.\nThe \"Plateosaurus\" was the first long-necked plant eater in the Triassic. An adult \"Plateosaurus\" could weigh up to and grow long. They used both hands to pull leaves off trees, but since they had weak teeth, they used their sharp thumb claws to defend themselves against predators.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flat","surface_form":"flat","offset":25},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":30},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":44},{"uri":"Prosauropod","surface_form":"prosauropod","offset":66},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":78},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":145},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":219},{"uri":"Claws","surface_form":"claws","offset":464}]}
