{"id":69872,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia","text":"Utopia is a name for an imaginary community or society with a perfect system of laws and politics.\nSir Thomas More invented the word for his 1516 book \"Utopia\". The book was about a fictional island in the Atlantic Ocean. The word has been used to describe both a perfect society, and societies in literature. A related idea is dystopia.\nThere have been many utopias based on politics, economics, religion, ecology. Some of these have been propagated in books and pamphlets, some as actual communities. In practice, attempts to create utopias seem doomed, as good intentions run against problems. Most of the literary utopias are actually satires of existing societies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":34},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":47},{"uri":"Sir_Thomas_More","surface_form":"Sir Thomas More","offset":99},{"uri":"Utopia_(book)","surface_form":"Utopia","offset":152},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":192},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":206},{"uri":"Dystopia","surface_form":"dystopia","offset":328},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":639}]}
