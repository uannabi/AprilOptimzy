During this time, they were managed by Michael Hayes. In 1999, they fought mainly with Edge and Christian.\nThe team of Matt and Jeff won the WWE Tag Team Championship six times. Because of this, they would be known as one of the most successful tag teams in WWE history. In 2000, Matt and Jeff found a new manager in their real-life friend Lita.
