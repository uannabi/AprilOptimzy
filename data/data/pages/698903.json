It is obtained from trees of the genus \"Boswellia\" in the family Burseraceae.\nFrankincense is tapped from the scraggly but hardy trees by striping (slashing the bark).

The hardened streaks of resin are called tears.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Incense","surface_form":"incense","offset":42},{"uri":"Boswellia","surface_form":"Boswellia","offset":104},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":122},{"uri":"Burseraceae","surface_form":"Burseraceae","offset":129},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":236}]}
