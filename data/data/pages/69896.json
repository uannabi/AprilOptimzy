{"id":69896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital","text":"A digital system is a system that stores data in a discrete way. The opposite is an analogue (US- analog) system, which stores the data in a continuous way. Usually, digital systems store the information in a binary way; that is, every bit of information can not have a value other than \"zero\" (off) or \"one\" (on). Larger amounts of data are stored as a string of these bits, which means a set of 0s and 1s together make a meaning to the system.\nThe word \"digital\" is most commonly used in computing and electronics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Discrete","surface_form":"discrete","offset":51},{"uri":"Analog_signal","surface_form":"analogue","offset":84},{"uri":"Continuous","surface_form":"continuous","offset":141},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":209},{"uri":"Bit","surface_form":"bit","offset":236},{"uri":"Computing","surface_form":"computing","offset":490},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronics","offset":504}]}
