{"id":699015,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cree","text":"The Cree (in Cree language; in French) are one of the First Nations in North America. They are one of the largest groups.\nIn Canada, over 350,000 people are Cree or have Cree ancestors. Most Cree in Canada live in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. About 27,000 of them live in Quebec.\nDuring their history in the United States, Cree people lived west of Lake Superior. Today, they live mostly in Montana, in the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. Ojibwe (Chippewa) people also live in that reservation.\nThey have moved west over time because they were traders and hunters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"First_Nations","surface_form":"First Nations","offset":54},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":71},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":175},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":199},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":214},{"uri":"Manitoba","surface_form":"Manitoba","offset":223},{"uri":"Saskatchewan","surface_form":"Saskatchewan","offset":233},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":247},{"uri":"Northwest_Territories","surface_form":"Northwest Territories","offset":263},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":315},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":351},{"uri":"Lake_Superior","surface_form":"Lake Superior","offset":392},{"uri":"Montana","surface_form":"Montana","offset":434},{"uri":"Rocky_Boy_Indian_Reservation","surface_form":"Rocky Boy Indian Reservation","offset":450},{"uri":"Ojibwe","surface_form":"Ojibwe","offset":480}]}
