{"id":69904,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filioque_clause","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Filioque clause is a part of the Nicene Creed that not all Christians agree about. \"Filioque\" is Latin. In the context (of the Nicene Creed) it means \"and from the Son\". The main parties involved are the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church rejects this change, the Catholic Church, as well as most Protestant and the Anglican Church accept it.\nThe Latin text is given below, the change is highlighted. This was added in the Catholic version.\nMany Eastern Catholic Churches have the same version as the Eastern Orthodox Churches. They do however believe what the added words say.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nicene_Creed","surface_form":"Nicene Creed","offset":50},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":76},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":114},{"uri":"Roman_Catholicism","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":221},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox Church","offset":251},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":362},{"uri":"Anglicanism","surface_form":"Anglican Church","offset":381},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":412}]}
