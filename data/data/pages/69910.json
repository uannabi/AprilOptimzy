{"id":69910,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter","text":"A multimeter or a multitester is an electronic measuring tool that is a combination of several tools in one unit. It usually includes an ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter. Digital multimeters are sometimes called DMM too.\nModern multimeters can be used to measure electrical quantities other than current, resistance and voltage. For example, they can be used to measure frequency, capacitance, transistors Hfe and temperature.\nThe multimeter can make many tests, so it is often called \"multitester\". When measuring resistance it acts as an ohmmeter, showing ohms. For volts it would be a Voltmeter. Sometimes it is called a mixture of things like Volt/ohm meter or VOM. Most meters can measure volts, amps, and resistance.\nHow it can be measured.\nThe multimeter can be used to measure the voltage of a battery. It can also be used for measuring the voltage across two points in a circuit. The Voltmeter is placed in parallel between the positive and negative terminals of the battery. It can also be used to measure resistance and amps hence the name of some meters \"Voltmeter, Ohmmeter, and Amperage\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":36},{"uri":"Measuring_tool","surface_form":"measuring tool","offset":47},{"uri":"Ammeter","surface_form":"ammeter","offset":137},{"uri":"Voltmeter","surface_form":"voltmeter","offset":146},{"uri":"Ohmmeter","surface_form":"ohmmeter","offset":161},{"uri":"Electrical_current","surface_form":"current","offset":296},{"uri":"Electrical_resistance","surface_form":"resistance","offset":305},{"uri":"Voltage","surface_form":"voltage","offset":320},{"uri":"Frequency","surface_form":"frequency","offset":370},{"uri":"Capacitance","surface_form":"capacitance","offset":381},{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":394},{"uri":"Hfe","surface_form":"Hfe","offset":406},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":414},{"uri":"Ohm","surface_form":"ohm","offset":558},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"volt","offset":568},{"uri":"Voltmeter","surface_form":"Voltmeter","offset":588}]}
