Both teams played in a \"best-of-seven\" series (one team has to win at least four games). This series began on 30 May and ended on 13 June after six games were played. The Toronto Raptors won against the Golden State Warriors. Both teams had won their conference finals (the Raptors play in the Eastern Conference and the Warriors play in the Western Conference), meaning they had to face off. The Raptors won four games and the Warriors won two games. Game six was the last match. This was the first time the Raptors won an NBA Final and also the first time a Canadian team won a final.\nThe Warriors played in the NBA Finals again. It was their fifth and last straight year of playing in the finals. This was the first time the Raptors have played in the NBA Finals.\nVictory parade.\nOn 17 June, the Raptors held a parade in Toronto to celebrate them winning. It began at Princes' Gates in Exhibition Place and ended at Nathan Phillips Square next to the Toronto City Hall. Over two million people came to watch the parade. Because of this, the parade was the largest public gathering in Canadian history. However, because there were so many people, the parade was slowed down by three hours.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"NBA_Finals","surface_form":"championship series","offset":26},{"uri":"National_Basketball_Association","surface_form":"National Basketball Association","offset":53},{"uri":"2018%E2%80%9319_NBA_season","surface_form":"2018\u201319 season","offset":93},{"uri":"Toronto_Raptors","surface_form":"Toronto Raptors","offset":280},{"uri":"Golden_State_Warriors","surface_form":"Golden State Warriors","offset":312},{"uri":"NBA_Conference_Finals","surface_form":"conference finals","offset":360},{"uri":"Parade","surface_form":"parade","offset":923},{"uri":"Princes%27_Gates","surface_form":"Princes' Gates","offset":980},{"uri":"Exhibition_Place","surface_form":"Exhibition Place","offset":998},{"uri":"Nathan_Phillips_Square","surface_form":"Nathan Phillips Square","offset":1028},{"uri":"Toronto_City_Hall","surface_form":"Toronto City Hall","offset":1063}]}
