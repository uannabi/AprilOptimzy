{"id":69929,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invitee","text":"=\"preserve\">In tort law, an invitee is a member of the public who has been invited to do business with the owner of a property. For example, if someone owns a store and invites someone else to come into the store to buy something, the person who is invited is an \"invitee\".\nIn some places (or jurisdictions), tort law asks whether a person is an invitee when it decides what duty the owner of land has to keep that person safe from harm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tort","surface_form":"tort","offset":15},{"uri":"Invite","surface_form":"invited","offset":75},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":89},{"uri":"Owner","surface_form":"owner","offset":107},{"uri":"Property","surface_form":"property","offset":118},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"store","offset":159},{"uri":"Jurisdiction","surface_form":"jurisdiction","offset":293}]}
