It was released as a single in 1980.\nConcept.\nThe Wall is a concept album depicting the story of Pink, an alienated rock star. At this point in the story, Pink is imagining himself as a fascist dictator during one of his shows. His behavior turns his crowd into a vicious mob, following his commands. The lyrics are threatening, and directed to the listener. The lyrics call the listener one with an \"empty smile\" and a \"hungry heart\", \"dirty feelings\" and a \"guilty past\".\nHistory.\nThe song was originally written by David Gilmour. The lyrics were written by Roger Waters. Waters provides all of the vocals on the studio version, but in live versions, Gilmour and Waters trade vocals each line.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":56},{"uri":"The_Wall","surface_form":"The Wall","offset":74},{"uri":"David_Gilmour","surface_form":"David Gilmour","offset":602},{"uri":"Roger_Waters","surface_form":"Roger Waters","offset":644}]}
