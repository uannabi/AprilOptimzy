It involved at least three unknown people. It is an example of what is known in the television business as broadcast signal intrusion.\nTwo Chicago television stations, WGN-TV and WTTW, had their broadcast signals hijacked by an unknown person wearing a Max Headroom mask and sunglasses. A homemade Max Headroom background rocked back and forth in the background. The incident happened two times within a course of three hours.\nThe first incident took place for 25 seconds during the sportscast on the 9:00 PM news on WGN-TV Channel 9, and the second, two hours later, after 11:00 PM on PBS related WTTW Channel 11 for about 90 seconds during a broadcast of an episode of the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"Horror of Fang Rock\".\nThe incident made national headlines and the people responsible have never been identified.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Broadcast_signal_intrusion","surface_form":"signal hijacking","offset":61},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":95},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":104},{"uri":"Broadcast_signal_intrusion","surface_form":"broadcast signal intrusion","offset":273},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":305},{"uri":"WGN-TV","surface_form":"WGN-TV","offset":334},{"uri":"WTTW","surface_form":"WTTW","offset":345},{"uri":"Max_Headroom_(character)","surface_form":"Max Headroom","offset":419},{"uri":"WGN-TV","surface_form":"WGN-TV","offset":683},{"uri":"PBS","surface_form":"PBS","offset":752},{"uri":"WTTW","surface_form":"WTTW","offset":764},{"uri":"Doctor_Who","surface_form":"Doctor Who","offset":842},{"uri":"Horror_of_Fang_Rock","surface_form":"Horror of Fang Rock","offset":862}]}
