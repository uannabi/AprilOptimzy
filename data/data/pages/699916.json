It samples \"It Makes Me Ill\" by the American boy band *NSYNC.\nGrande has performed the song during her Coachella Festival set in April 2019 (with *NSYNC) and on her Sweetener World Tour.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ariana_Grande","surface_form":"Ariana Grande","offset":77},{"uri":"Thank_u%2C_next_(album)","surface_form":"thank u, next","offset":122},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":166},{"uri":"7_rings","surface_form":"7 rings","offset":208},{"uri":"Thank_u%2C_next","surface_form":"thank u, next","offset":232},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":386},{"uri":"Max_Martin","surface_form":"Max Martin","offset":432},{"uri":"%27N_Sync","surface_form":"*NSYNC","offset":600},{"uri":"Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival","surface_form":"Coachella Festival","offset":649},{"uri":"Sweetener_(album)","surface_form":"Sweetener","offset":711}]}
