{"id":69993,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scelidosaurus","text":"\"Scelidosaurus\" was an early type of herbivorous dinosaur. It was a thyreophoran, a lightly plated, herbivorous dinosaur about 4 metres long. It lived during the early Jurassic, 208 to 194 million years ago. Its fossils have been found in England, Ireland, and in Arizona, in the United States.\n\"Scelidosaurus\" has been called the earliest complete dinosaur. This and related genera have been found on three continents.\nIt is one of the earliest and most basal of the armoured dinosaurs. A review by Serano had \"Scelidosaurus\" as the sister group (closest relative) to both the Stegosauria and Ankylosauria.\nA full-grown \"Scelidosaurus\" was rather small, compared to some later dinosaurs. Its length was about 4\u00A0metres (13\u00A0ft). \"Scelidosaurus\" was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its forefeet were as large as its hind feet, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture.\n\"Scelidosaurus\" and its Jurassic relatives were herbivorous. Other ornithischians had teeth capable of grinding plant material, but \"Scelidosaurus\" had smaller, less complex teeth. Its jaw could only do simple up-and-down movements. In this aspect, they resembled the stegosaurids, which also had primitive teeth and simple jaws. Also, like stegosaurs, they may have swallowed gastroliths to aid processing of food (because of the lack of chewing ability). This is also done by modern birds and crocodiles. The diet of \"Scelidosaurus\" was low-lying plants (like cycads) and probably also fruits. Seaweeds have also been suggested as its food. Grass did not evolve until the Cretaceous period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thyreophora","surface_form":"thyreophora","offset":68},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":112},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":168},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":239},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":248},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":264},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":280},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":376},{"uri":"Basal","surface_form":"basal","offset":455},{"uri":"Stegosauria","surface_form":"Stegosauria","offset":578},{"uri":"Ankylosauria","surface_form":"Ankylosauria","offset":594},{"uri":"Quadruped","surface_form":"quadruped","offset":748},{"uri":"Stegosauridae","surface_form":"stegosaurids","offset":1237},{"uri":"Gastrolith","surface_form":"gastrolith","offset":1346},{"uri":"Cycads","surface_form":"cycads","offset":1531},{"uri":"Seaweed","surface_form":"Seaweed","offset":1565},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"Grass","offset":1612},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":1643}]}
