{"id":700002,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_manga","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sh\u014Djo (\u5C11\u5973) is manga (Japanese comics) made for young girls, normally ages 7-19. One of the most popular sh\u014Djo manga series is \"Sailor Moon\". Many sh\u014Djo manga are about things like love, friendship, and romance, but some are more serious and action-based. Most sh\u014Djo characters are female, and around middle-school or high-school age.\nHistory.\nSh\u014Djo was first made in Japan for young female readers, like how sh\u014Dnen is for young male readers. They started to appear in the early 1900s. Most sh\u014Djo made during this time focused on humor and life in the home. However, after World War II, manga artists began writing more fast-paced, intense stories. This brought upon the magical girl genre, which helped make manga as a whole popular around the world.\nSh\u014Djo in the West.\nIn the 90s and early 2000s, the western world began to see more manga and anime, including sh\u014Djo. With publishers like VIZ and Dark Horse Comics coming out with English versions of manga during this time, western readers had more access to Japanese comics than ever. Before then, many manga were Japan-exclusive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manga","surface_form":"manga","offset":27},{"uri":"Sailor_Moon","surface_form":"Sailor Moon","offset":140},{"uri":"Sh%C5%8Dnen","surface_form":"sh\u014Dnen","offset":421},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":585}]}
