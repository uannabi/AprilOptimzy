Lindsey Way loves art, she created lots of art as a child, stating that it was \"pretty much the only thing I was good at.\" In her late teen, early young adult years, Lindsey attended Pratt University to receive her degree in Fine Arts and Illustration.

Prior to joining the band she did not know how to play bass, or even what tablature was. The band called her in to audition. Lindsey stated that, \"There is no way I will get into this band on bass talent alone.\" The manager of the band videotaped her and requested that she play three songs. This happened twice, as the first time she broke her bass strap and did not successfully play the three songs and the band was unimpressed on the first attempt. On her second attempt, [https://msi.fandom.com/wiki/Steve,_Righ%3F Steve Righ?] the guitarist for the band had his back to her. Because this second attempt went so poorly, the manager requests that she try a third time. One of the songs played in this audition was the Mindless Self Indulgence song Tornado. While auditioning with this song, Lindsey took a film canister filled with Bacardi 151 out of her bra and proceeded to drink the shot. During the whole audition, Lindsey has matches stuck in her pigtails, she pulls these out of her pigtails immediately after taking the shot and strikes them on the stock on her bass. She blew out the liquor and lit it on fire, which gave her the appearance of blowing fire. Due to her lack of bass skills, this stunt is how she convinced the band into accepting her.
