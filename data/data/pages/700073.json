The Japanese \"Kokuka Courageous\" and Norwegian \"Front Altair\" were attacked with limpet mines or flying objects, causing fire damage to both ships.\nAmerican and Iranian military personnel responded to the attacks and were involved in rescuing crew members from the ships. The attacks took place a month after the similar May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident and on the same day that Ayatollah Khamenei met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014D Abe in Iran.\nAmid tensions between Iran and the United States, the United States blamed Iran for the attacks. Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom supported the United States' accusation, while Japan and Germany want more proof of Iran's culpability. Iran denied the accusation, blaming the United States for spreading wrong information. The cause is currently under investigation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oil_tanker","surface_form":"oil tanker","offset":22},{"uri":"Strait_of_Hormuz","surface_form":"Strait of Hormuz","offset":57},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Oman","surface_form":"Gulf of Oman","offset":95},{"uri":"Limpet_mine","surface_form":"limpet mine","offset":190},{"uri":"May_2019_Gulf_of_Oman_incident","surface_form":"May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident","offset":430},{"uri":"Ali_Khamenei","surface_form":"Ayatollah Khamenei","offset":486},{"uri":"Shinz%C5%8D_Abe","surface_form":"Shinz\u014D Abe","offset":538},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":580},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":593},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":655},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":676},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":738},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":748}]}
