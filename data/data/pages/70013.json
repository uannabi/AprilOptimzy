{"id":70013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armiger","text":"A person who has a coat of arms is sometimes called an \"armiger\". They are armigerous.\nOriginally an armiger was an Armour-Bearer or Esquire, who helped a Knight, but who had his own coat of arms.\nThe term \"armiger\" is well-defined only in countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, and Spain where there is a state or other heraldic body. These bodies include the College of Arms in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Office of the Chief Herald in the Republic of Ireland or the Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland).\nSomeone can have a coat of arms either because they are descended from a person with a right to bear a coat of arms, or by having a new \"grant of arms\" to him or herself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Esquire","surface_form":"Esquire","offset":133},{"uri":"Knight","surface_form":"Knight","offset":155},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":262},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":278},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":286},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":299},{"uri":"College_of_Arms","surface_form":"College of Arms","offset":377},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":396},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":405},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":416},{"uri":"Office_of_the_Chief_Herald_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Office of the Chief Herald","offset":438},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Republic of Ireland","offset":472},{"uri":"Court_of_the_Lord_Lyon","surface_form":"Court of the Lord Lyon","offset":499},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":525},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"coat of arms","offset":639}]}
