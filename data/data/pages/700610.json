{"id":700610,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgina_Kidd","text":"Virginia Kidd (June 2, 1921 \u2013 January 11, 2003) was an American literary agent, writer and editor, who worked in particular in science fiction and related fields. She represented science fiction American authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, R.A. Lafferty, Anne McCaffrey, Judith Merril, and Gene Wolfe. Wolfe modeled Ann Schindler, a character in his 1990 novel \"Castleview\", in large part on Kidd.\nLife and career.\nKidd was born Mildred Virginia Kidd in the Germantown district of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the youngest daughter of Charles Kidd, a printer, and Zetta Daisy Whorley. She had polio at age 2. She was paralyzed for a year from the chest down. Growing up she attended the Berlitz School of Languages where she developed fluency in Spanish, Latin, Italian, French, and German. Kidd discovered science fiction at age 9. She became an active science fiction fan. She was a Futurian and, in 1941, became one of the founding members of the Vanguard Amateur Press Association. She did not attend college, saying \"because I couldn't go to the University of Chicago, and I wouldn't go to any other.\" She married opera singer Jack Emden in 1943. They divorced in 1947. She then married the writer James Blish. They were married until 1963. She had four children: Karen Anne Emden (born 1944), Asa Benjamin Blish (born and died 1947), Dorothea Elisabeth Blish (born 1954), and Charles Benjamin Blish (born 1956).\nKidd successfully worked as a freelance writer, ghost writer, and proofreader. She is well known for her work in the feminist science fiction literary movement. She helped marginalized authors. She was a successful businesswoman who worked with major companies such as Ace Publishing and Parnassus Books. She was also a poet, and published \"Kinesis\", a little magazine for poetry. She helped to start the careers of writers including Sonya Dorman.\nHer short stories included \"Kangaroo Court\", published in 1966 in Damon Knight's \"Orbit 1\". She edited or co-edited several science fiction anthologies.\nShe edited two with her client and friend, Ursula K. LeGuin, \"Interfaces: An Anthology of Speculative Fiction\" (1980) and \"Edges: Thirteen New Tales from the Borderlands of the Imagination\" (1980). Kidd won the 12th Locus Award in 1979 for \"Millennial Women\".\nVirginia Kidd Literary Agency.\nIn 1965, she founded her Virginia Kidd Literary Agency. The agency was at her home, Arrowhead, in Milford, Pennsylvania. Soon, she had many clients from the science fiction community. She was the first female literary agent in speculative fiction.\nHer clients included David R. Bunch, Juanita Coulson, George Alec Effinger, Alan Dean Foster, Richard E. Geis, Ursula K. Le Guin, Zach Hughes, Laurence Janifer, R. A. Lafferty, Anne McCaffrey, Judith Merril, Ward Moore, Christopher Priest, Frank M. Robinson, Joanna Russ, and Gene Wolfe.\nShe stopped managing the agency in the mid-1990s because of health problems from diabetes. She died in 2003, but the agency still exists.\nThe Milford Method.\nAlong with author Damon Knight and husband James Blish, Kidd developed a method of critique known internationally as the Milford Method.\nTranslations.\n\u201CThe Monster in the Park.\u201D G\u00E9rard Klein (translated from French by Virginia Kidd). \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction,\" Vol. 21, No. 3, 1961","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Literary_agent","surface_form":"literary agent","offset":64},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":127},{"uri":"Ursula_K._Le_Guin","surface_form":"Ursula K.
