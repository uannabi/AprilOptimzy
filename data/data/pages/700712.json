{"id":700712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures","text":"RKO Pictures is a company in the United States that makes and sells movies. It was first known as RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. RKO was an acronym for Radio-Keith-Orpheum, the original parent company of RKO Radio Pictures. It was one of the Big Five studios of Hollywood's Golden Age. The company was made by the merger of the Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) theater chain and the Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) studio in October 1928. It was put together by David Sarnoff of RCA. His goal was to create a market for RCA's photophone, which was their sound-on-film technology. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor Floyd Odlum.\nRKO is well known for the musicals it made in the 1930s. These starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Other well-known actors got their start at RKO. Among these were Katharine Hepburn, Robert Mitchum, and Cary Grant. Many praise RKO's work on film noir. Val Lewton's low-budget horror movies are also praised by movie critics. RKO made two of the most famous movies in history. These are \"King Kong\" and \"Citizen Kane\". They also made movies with other studios. These include the well known \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Notorious\". RKO also took care of sales for movies made by Walt Disney from 1937 to the mid-1950s. The also took care of sales for Samuel Goldwyn.\nIn 1948, Howard Hughes took over RKO and this lead to a time of decline. Then in 1955, it was bought by the General Tire and Rubber Company. RKO stopped making new movies in 1957, and mostly shut down two years later. In 1959, the assets of RKO moved to a new company called RKO General. In 1981, RKO was revived under the name RKO Pictures Inc. In 1989, it was sold to new owners. They run it using the name RKO Pictures LLC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":33},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":68},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":134},{"uri":"Studio_system","surface_form":"Big Five","offset":236},{"uri":"Major_film_studio","surface_form":"studios","offset":245},{"uri":"Cinema_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":256},{"uri":"Keith-Albee-Orpheum","surface_form":"Keith-Albee-Orpheum","offset":322},{"uri":"Theater","surface_form":"theater","offset":348},{"uri":"Chain_store","surface_form":"chain","offset":356},{"uri":"Film_Booking_Offices_of_America","surface_form":"Film Booking Offices of America","offset":370},{"uri":"Movie_studio","surface_form":"studio","offset":408},{"uri":"David_Sarnoff","surface_form":"David Sarnoff","offset":455},{"uri":"RCA","surface_form":"RCA","offset":472},{"uri":"RCA_Photophone","surface_form":"photophone","offset":519},{"uri":"Sound-on-film","surface_form":"sound-on-film","offset":547},{"uri":"Investor","surface_form":"investor","offset":627},{"uri":"Floyd_Odlum","surface_form":"Floyd Odlum","offset":636},{"uri":"Musical_theater","surface_form":"musicals","offset":675},{"uri":"Fred_Astaire","surface_form":"Fred Astaire","offset":720},{"uri":"Ginger_Rogers","surface_form":"Ginger Rogers","offset":737},{"uri":"Katharine_Hepburn","surface_form":"Katharine Hepburn","offset":817},{"uri":"Robert_Mitchum","surface_form":"Robert Mitchum","offset":836},{"uri":"Cary_Grant","surface_form":"Cary Grant","offset":856},{"uri":"Film_noir","surface_form":"film noir","offset":894},{"uri":"Val_Lewton","surface_form":"Val Lewton","offset":905},{"uri":"Movie_criticism","surface_form":"movie critics","offset":963},{"uri":"King_Kong_(1933_film)","surface_form":"King Kong","offset":1040},{"uri":"Citizen_Kane","surface_form":"Citizen Kane","offset":1056},{"uri":"It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life","surface_form":"It's a Wonderful Life","offset":1143},{"uri":"Notorious_(1946_film)","surface_form":"Notorious","offset":1171},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Walt Disney","offset":1230},{"uri":"Samuel_Goldwyn_Productions","surface_form":"Samuel Goldwyn","offset":1302},{"uri":"Howard_Hughes","surface_form":"Howard Hughes","offset":1327},{"uri":"General_Tire_and_Rubber_Company","surface_form":"General Tire and Rubber Company","offset":1426},{"uri":"Asset","surface_form":"asset","offset":1549},{"uri":"RKO_General","surface_form":"RKO General","offset":1593},{"uri":"Revived","surface_form":"revived","offset":1623}]}
