{"id":70072,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1b","text":"Siyyid `Al\u00ED Mu\u1E25ammad (20 October 1819 \u2013 9 July 1850) was a merchant from Sh\u00EDr\u00E1z, Iran who started a version of Shia Islam called B\u00E1bism. After he started the religion, he changed his name to B\u00E1b. People who believe in the B\u00E1b are called B\u00E1b\u00EDs, and they believe that the B\u00E1b was a prophet. B\u00E1b\u00EDs also believe that the B\u00E1b is the Q\u00E1'im that Shi'as believe will come in the future.\nThe B\u00E1b wrote hundreds of letters and books teaching who he was and what the rules of his religion were. The B\u00E1b's new rules replaced the \"Sharia law\" or Muslim rules for his followers. B\u00E1bism became very large; over ten thousand people believed in the B\u00E1b. The Shi'a clergy, or leaders of Islam in Iran hated the B\u00E1b and tried to harm people who followed his religion. In 1850 a firing squad shot the B\u00E1b in Tabr\u00EDz, Iran.\nThe B\u00E1b had other names, for example the \"Primal Point\" and the \"Point of the Bay\u00E1n.\"\nThe B\u00E1b told everyone that another prophet who was stronger and even more powerful was coming soon. People who follow the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED religion believe the B\u00E1b was talking about Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h, who started the Bah\u00E1'\u00ED religion.\nEarly Life.\nThe B\u00E1b was born on October 20, 1819, in Shiraz, Iran. His father was a merchant, and many people in the town knew him. Very soon after the B\u00E1b was born, his father died. The B\u00E1b's uncle \u1E24\u00E1j\u00ED M\u00EDrz\u00E1 Siyyid `Al\u00ED was also a merchant, and he raised the B\u00E1b.\nWhen the B\u00E1b became an adult, he started working as a merchant with his uncle. In 1842 he married a woman named Khad\u00EDjih-Bagum. Together they had one son, who they named A\u1E25mad. A\u1E25mad was very sick and died when as a baby. Someone who lived at the same time as the B\u00E1b said he was very calm and quiet; they said the B\u00E1b only spoke who he had too, and did not even answer questions. The B\u00E1b was always thinking and praying. People said he was handsome, and had a thin beard. He always dressed in clean clothes, and wore a green scarf and a black turban, or wrap of cloth on his head.\nThe Shaykhis.\nShaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i started a Shi'a Islam religious group in Persia in the 1790s. The member of the group, who were called Shaykhis, believes that god was sending a new messenger to earth very soon. They called the new messenger the Q\u00E1'im, or theMahdi. When Shaykh Ahmad died, Siyyid K\u00E1zim, who was from Rasht, Iran, became the new leader of the Shaykhis. Shaykh Ahmad lived was born in 1753 and he died in 1862. Siyyid K\u00E1zim was born in 1793 and he died in 1843.\nWhen the B\u00E1b went on a pilgrimage to Karbala and the places near it, he may have listened to Siyyid K\u00E1zim teach. Nobody knows for sure if he did or did not, because there are very few documents or records from that time.\nWhen Siyyid K\u00E1zim was dying, in December, he told all his followers\u2014people who believe what he taught\u2014that they should travel and try to find the new prophet from god. He called that prophet \"The Lord of the Age\", and told them that he would be discovered very soon. One of the people who believed Siyyid K\u00E1zim prayed and fasted, or stopped eating from dawn to dusk for forty days - his name was Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn. After that he travelled to Shiraz, and he met the B\u00E1b.\nAnnouncement to Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn.\nMull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn got to Shiraz on May 23, 1844. A young man wearing a green turban greeted him after he had not been in Shiraz for very long. In Iran at that time, only people who were related to the prophet Mu\u1E25ammad wore green turbans. Men who were related to the prophet Mu\u1E25ammad were called Siyyids. The young man was the B\u00E1b, and he invited Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn to his home.\nThe B\u00E1b asked Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn why he was in Shiraz, and Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn told him that he was searching for the new prophet, or Promised One. The B\u00E1b asked Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn how he would know who the prophet way. Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn told him that the prophet would come from a famous and good family, and would know many things without having to learn them, also that he would have no problems with his body. Then the B\u00E1b said that all of those things were true about himself. \"Behold, all these signs are manifest in me.\" The B\u00E1b was saying that he was the new prophet Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn had been looking for. This shocked, or startled Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn.\nMull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn had one more way to know who the new prophet was, and he had not told the B\u00E1b about. Siyyid K\u00E1\u1E93im had told Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn that the new prophet would write a book explaining the Surih of Joseph. Siyyid K\u00E1\u1E93im had also said that the new prophet would do this without anyone asking him to. After the B\u00E1b told Mull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn that he was the new prophet, he wrote a book about the Surih of Joseph. The B\u00E1b called that book the Qayy\u00FAmu'l-Asm\u00E1'\nAfter spending the night talking to the B\u00E1b Mull\u00E1 Husayn said this. (The words below might be hard to read.)\nLetters of the Living.\nMull\u00E1 \u1E24usayn was the B\u00E1b's first disciple. A student of a religious leader is called a disciple. In less than five months, seventeen more students of Siyyid K\u00E1\u1E93im became disciples of the B\u00E1b. All of the new disciples started believing the B\u00E1b was a new manifestation, or prophet of god without anyone else's help. One of these new disciples was a woman. Her name was Zarr\u00EDn T\u00E1j Baragh\u00E1ni, and she was a poet. Later she was given a new name,\u1E6C\u00E1hirih (the pure). Later people started calling the first eighteen disciples and the B\u00E1b the Letters of the Living. The B\u00E1b told the Letters of the Living that it was their job to tell people that he was the new prophet.\nThe B\u00E1b said that the Letters of the Living were special. In Shi'a Islam there are fourteen special people, called the \"Infallibles\". Shi'as believe the \"Infallibles\" are always right. Muhammad, the twelve Im\u00E1ms, and Fatimah, are the \"Infallibles\" in Shi'a Islam. Just like the \"Infallibles\", one of the letters of the Living was a woman, and one was a prophet. Nineteen was a special number in B\u00E1bism. The Letters of the Living were very much like the Twelve Apostles of Christ.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sh%C3%ADr%C3%A1z","surface_form":"Sh\u00EDr\u00E1z","offset":73},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":81},{"uri":"Shia","surface_form":"Shia","offset":111},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":116},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":280},{"uri":"Q%C3%A1%27im","surface_form":"Q\u00E1'im","offset":328},{"uri":"Shi%27a","surface_form":"Shi'a","offset":339},{"uri":"Sharia_law","surface_form":"Sharia law","offset":518},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":533},{"uri":"Clergy","surface_form":"clergy","offset":647},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":669},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":678},{"uri":"Firing_squad","surface_form":"firing squad","offset":759},{"uri":"Tabr%C3%ADz%2C_Iran","surface_form":"Tabr\u00EDz, Iran","offset":788},{"uri":"Bay%C3%A1n_(exposition)","surface_form":"Bay\u00E1n","offset":880},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'\u00ED","offset":1010},{"uri":"Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h","surface_form":"Bah\u00E1'u'll\u00E1h","offset":1060},{"uri":"Shiraz%2C_Iran","surface_form":"Shiraz, Iran","offset":1159},{"uri":"%E1%B8%A4%C3%A1j%C3%AD_M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1_Siyyid_%60Al%C3%AD","surface_form":"\u1E24\u00E1j\u00ED M\u00EDrz\u00E1 Siyyid `Al\u00ED","offset":1305},{"uri":"Khad%C3%ADjih-Bagum","surface_form":"Khad\u00EDjih-Bagum","offset":1484},{"uri":"Shaykh_Ahmad-i-Ahsa%27i","surface_form":"Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i","offset":1968},{"uri":"Shi%27a_Islam","surface_form":"Shi'a Islam","offset":2000},{"uri":"Al-Qa%27im_(person)","surface_form":"Q\u00E1'im","offset":2203},{"uri":"Mahdi","surface_form":"Mahdi","offset":2216},{"uri":"Siyyid_K%C3%A1zim","surface_form":"Siyyid K\u00E1zim","offset":2247},{"uri":"Rasht","surface_form":"Rasht","offset":2274},{"uri":"Karbala","surface_form":"Karbala","offset":2471},{"uri":"Yusuf_(sura)","surface_form":"Surih of Joseph","offset":4331},{"uri":"Yusuf_(sura)","surface_form":"Surih of Joseph","offset":4527},{"uri":"Qayy%C3%BAmu%27l-Asm%C3%A1%27","surface_form":"Qayy\u00FAmu'l-Asm\u00E1'","offset":4573},{"uri":"Mull%C3%A1_Husayn","surface_form":"Mull\u00E1 Husayn","offset":4633},{"uri":"Disciple","surface_form":"disciple","offset":4754},{"uri":"T%C3%A1hirih","surface_form":"\u1E6C\u00E1hirih","offset":5161},{"uri":"Letters_of_the_Living","surface_form":"Letters of the Living","offset":5255},{"uri":"Im%C3%A1ms","surface_form":"Im\u00E1ms","offset":5589},{"uri":"Fatimah","surface_form":"Fatimah","offset":5600}]}
