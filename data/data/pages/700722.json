{"id":700722,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Fulbright Program, including the Fulbright\u2013Hays Program, is one of several United States Cultural Exchange Programs. The goal is to improve intercultural relations, cultural diplomacy, and intercultural competence between people from the United States and other countries by exchanging of people, knowledge, and skills. It is one of the most prestigious and fellowship programs in the world. It is also very difficult to receive a grant. American citizens including students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists and artists may receive scholarships or grants to study, do research, teach, or exercise their talents abroad. Citizens of other countries may do the same in the United States of America. The program was started by United States Senator J. William Fulbright in 1946 and is one of the most widely recognized and prestigious scholarships in the world. The program provides 8,000 grants annually.\nThe Fulbright Program is administered by cooperating organizations such as the Institute of International Education. It is in over 160 countries around the world. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State sponsors the Fulbright Program and gets funding from the United States Congress from annual appropriation bills. Additional direct and in-kind support comes from partner governments, foundations, corporations, and host institutions both in and outside the U.S. In 49 countries, a bi-national Fulbright Commission administers and oversees the Fulbright Program. In countries without a Fulbright Commission but that have an active program, the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy manages the Fulbright Program. More than 370,000 people have participated in the program since it began; 59 Fulbright alumni have won Nobel Prizes; 82 have won Pulitzer Prizes.\nHistory.\nIn 1945, Senator J. William Fulbright proposed a bill to use the profits from selling surplus U.S. government war property to fund international exchange between the U.S. and other countries. The timing after the Second War was important. Along side the United Nations, the Fulbright Program was an attempt to promote peace and understanding through educational exchange. The bill had a plan to forgive the debts foreign countries piled up during the war and in return for funding an international educational program. This program was planned to be an essential vehicle to promote peace and mutual understanding between individuals, institutions and future leaders anywhere in the world.\nOn August 1, 1946, President Harry S. Truman signed the bill into law, and Congress created the Fulbright Program in what became the largest education exchange program in history.\nSince it began, the program has operated on a bi-nationally. Each country in the Fulbright Program has an agreement with the U.S. government. The first countries to sign agreements were China in 1947 and Burma, the Philippines, and Greece in 1948.\nProgram.\nThe Fulbright Program works two ways: U.S. citizens may receive funding to go to a foreign country (U.S. Student Program, U.S. Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, etc.) and non-U.S. citizens may come to the U.S. (Foreign Student Program, Visiting Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, etc.).\nCandidates recommended for Fulbright grants should have high academic achievement, a strong project proposal or statement of purpose, demonstrated leadership potential, and flexibility and adaptability to work successfully with the host community abroad.\nFulbright grants are offered in almost all academic disciplines except clinical medical research with patient contact.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Cultural_Exchange_Programs","surface_form":"United States Cultural Exchange Programs","offset":93},{"uri":"Intercultural_relations","surface_form":"intercultural relations","offset":158},{"uri":"Cultural_diplomacy","surface_form":"cultural diplomacy","offset":183},{"uri":"Intercultural_competence","surface_form":"intercultural competence","offset":207},{"uri":"American_citizen","surface_form":"American citizen","offset":456},{"uri":"Grant_(money)","surface_form":"grants","offset":580},{"uri":"United_States_Senator","surface_form":"United States Senator","offset":755},{"uri":"J._William_Fulbright","surface_form":"J.
