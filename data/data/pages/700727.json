{"id":700727,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutin","text":"Eutin () is the district capital of Eastern Holstein county. It is in the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein. As of 2015, about 17,000 people lived in the town.\nHistory.\nThe name Eutin (originally Utin) is Slavic. Its meaning is not clear. It probably came from the personal name \"Uta\". The Slavic Obotrites tribe settled eastern Holstein in the 7th/8th centuries A.D. and built a castle on Pheasant Island in the lake now called the Gro\u00DFer Eutiner See.\nDutch settlers came to live in \"Utin\" in the twelfth century. In 1156 Eutin became a market town. It later became the seat of the Prince-Bishopric of L\u00FCbeck because L\u00FCbeck itself was an imperial free city. When the bishopric was secularized in 1803, Eutin became part of the Duchy of Oldenburg. In the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, Eutin passed from the Free State of Oldenburg to the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. After World War II, it became part of the modern Bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein.\nCulture.\nEutin is birthplace of composer Carl Maria von Weber. To honor him, an open-air theater (') was built in the park of Eutin Castle in 1951. Operas are performed there in July and August during the Eutin Opera Summer Festival ('). The seating capacity of this open-air venue is about 2000. The festival includes music students in Eutin aand students from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, US. Lawrence is a twin city with Eutin.\nEutin has an annual Blues Festival (Bluesfest Eutin) at the beginning of summer. Local musicians, as well as up and coming blues artists from around the world, come to play at this three-day outdoor blues festival. The festival is in the market place in the center of town. Admission is free.\nGeography and economy.\nEutin is surrounded by lakes of the Holsteinische Schweiz, including the Gro\u00DFer Eutiner See, Kleiner Eutiner See, Kellersee and Ukleisee. There are forests around the lakes. Popular activities on these lakes include boating, canoeing, rowing, swimming, and fishing.\nSchleswig-Holstein, particularly Eutin, has many rapeseed fields. They produce biofuel. Wind turbines are also a common in this rural region.\nInternational relations.\nEach summer, Lawrence and Eutin have an exchange program. High-school students from Lawrence and college students from the University of Kansas have some weeks in Eutin. German students from Eutin come to Lawrence to study. The University of Kansas also created an internship exchange program with Eutin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ostholstein","surface_form":"Eastern Holstein","offset":36},{"uri":"Schleswig-Holstein","surface_form":"Schleswig-Holstein","offset":96},{"uri":"Obotrites","surface_form":"Obotrites","offset":304},{"uri":"Utin_(castle)","surface_form":"castle","offset":387},{"uri":"Pheasant_Island_(Eutin)","surface_form":"Pheasant Island","offset":397},{"uri":"Gro%C3%9Fer_Eutiner_See","surface_form":"Gro\u00DFer Eutiner See","offset":440},{"uri":"Prince-Bishopric_of_L%C3%BCbeck","surface_form":"Prince-Bishopric of L\u00FCbeck","offset":590},{"uri":"L%C3%BCbeck","surface_form":"L\u00FCbeck","offset":625},{"uri":"Imperial_free_city","surface_form":"imperial free city","offset":646},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Oldenburg","surface_form":"Duchy of Oldenburg","offset":735},{"uri":"Greater_Hamburg_Act","surface_form":"Greater Hamburg Act","offset":762},{"uri":"Free_State_of_Oldenburg","surface_form":"Free State of Oldenburg","offset":813},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":844},{"uri":"Province_of_Schleswig-Holstein","surface_form":"Province of Schleswig-Holstein","offset":853},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":891},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"Bundesland","offset":934},{"uri":"Carl_Maria_von_Weber","surface_form":"Carl Maria von Weber","offset":1009},{"uri":"Eutin_Castle","surface_form":"Eutin Castle","offset":1094},{"uri":"Eutin_Opera_Summer_Festival","surface_form":"Eutin Opera Summer Festival","offset":1173},{"uri":"University_of_Kansas","surface_form":"University of Kansas","offset":1334},{"uri":"Lawrence%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Lawrence","offset":1358},{"uri":"Bluesfest_Eutin","surface_form":"Bluesfest Eutin","offset":1452},{"uri":"Holsteinische_Schweiz","surface_form":"Holsteinische Schweiz","offset":1768},{"uri":"Gro%C3%9Fer_Eutiner_See","surface_form":"Gro\u00DFer Eutiner See","offset":1805},{"uri":"Kleiner_Eutiner_See","surface_form":"Kleiner Eutiner See","offset":1825},{"uri":"Kellersee","surface_form":"Kellersee","offset":1846},{"uri":"Ukleisee","surface_form":"Ukleisee","offset":1860},{"uri":"Rapeseed","surface_form":"rapeseed","offset":2047},{"uri":"University_of_Kansas","surface_form":"University of Kansas","offset":2393}]}
