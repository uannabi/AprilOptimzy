{"id":700735,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bicycle_Day","text":"In April 2018, the United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as International World Bicycle Day. The resolution for World Bicycle Day recognizes \"the uniqueness, longevity and versatility of the Bicycle, which has been in use for two centuries, and that it is a simple, affordable, reliable, clean and environmentally fit sustainable means of transportation.\"\nProfessor Leszek Sibilski from the United States led a grassroots campaign with his Sociology class to promote a UN Resolution for World Bicycle Day, eventually gaining the support of Turkmenistan and 56 other countries. The original UN Blue and White World Bicycle Day logo was designed by Isaac Feld and the accompanying animation was done by Professor John E. Swanson. It depicts bicyclists of various types riding around the globe. At the bottom of the logo is the hashtag #June3WorldBicycleDay. The main message is that the bicycle belongs to and serves all of humanity.\nWorld Bicycle Day is a global holiday meant to be enjoyed by all people regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, class, sex, gender, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. The bicycle as a symbol of human progress and advancement \"[promotes] tolerance, mutual understanding and respect and [facilitates] social inclusion and a culture of peace.\"\nWorld Bicycle Day is now being associated with promoting a healthy lifestyle for those with diabetes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","surface_form":"United Nations General Assembly","offset":19},{"uri":"June_3","surface_form":"June 3","offset":60},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"Bicycle","offset":201},{"uri":"Environmentalism","surface_form":"environmentally","offset":308},{"uri":"Sustainable_development","surface_form":"sustainable","offset":328},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"Sociology","offset":450},{"uri":"Turkmenistan","surface_form":"Turkmenistan","offset":550},{"uri":"Toleration","surface_form":"tolerance","offset":1196},{"uri":"Healthy_lifestyle","surface_form":"healthy lifestyle","offset":1359},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":1392}]}
