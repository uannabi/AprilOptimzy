He started working as a butcher's apprentice in Kad\u0131k\u00F6y district, Istanbul.\nG\u00F6k\u00E7e is also known for his charitable work. He built a school in his hometown of Erzurum.\nAs an internet meme.\nG\u00F6k\u00E7e became famous from a series of viral Internet videos and memes. The videos show him \"suavely\" cutting meat and sprinkling salt.\nHis fame came from a viral video, \"Ottoman Steak\", posted on 7 January 2017. The video exceeded 10 million views on Instagram. He was nicknamed \"Salt Bae\" because of his particular way of salting meat: dropping it from his fingertips to his forearm, and then falling onto the dish. Due to the fame gained from this post, G\u00F6k\u00E7e's profile has expanded enormously. His restaurants, as well and Nusret himself, have served many celebrities and politicians.\nRestaurants.\nG\u00F6k\u00E7e has visited several countries, including Argentina and the United States between 2007 and 2010. There he worked in local restaurants for free, in order to gain experience as a cook and a restaurateur. After his return to Turkey, G\u00F6k\u00E7e opened his first restaurant in Istanbul in 2010. In 2014, he opened a restaurant in Dubai.\nThe dishes served at G\u00F6k\u00E7e's restaurants have received mixed reviews and have been described as \"overpriced\". Early professional reviews in 2018 of his New York City steakhouse were generally negative. \"The New York Post\"s Steve Cuozzo called the restaurant \"Public Rip-off No. 1\". In an article on GQ, Joshua David Stein called the steak mundane and the hamburgers overcooked. However, from an entertainment standpoint, reviews were more positive.\nIn December 2017, he received criticism for a photo posing in front of an image of Fidel Castro, which was taken in 2016. In September 2018, G\u00F6k\u00E7e and the president of Venezuela Nicol\u00E1s Maduro also received criticism for their actions at G\u00F6k\u00E7e's Istanbul restaurant. The reason was the latter's perceived insensitivity to the crisis and shortages in Venezuela.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":67},{"uri":"Butcher","surface_form":"butcher","offset":75},{"uri":"Restaurateur","surface_form":"restaurateur","offset":94},{"uri":"Internet_meme","surface_form":"Internet meme","offset":235},{"uri":"Erzurum","surface_form":"Erzurum","offset":283},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":292},{"uri":"Kurds","surface_form":"Kurdish","offset":314},{"uri":"Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y","surface_form":"Kad\u0131k\u00F6y","offset":485},{"uri":"Istanbul","surface_form":"Istanbul","offset":503},{"uri":"Viral_video","surface_form":"viral video","offset":780},{"uri":"Instagram","surface_form":"Instagram","offset":875},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":947},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1272},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1290},{"uri":"Restaurateur","surface_form":"restaurateur","offset":1418},{"uri":"Dubai","surface_form":"Dubai","offset":1550},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1709},{"uri":"The_New_York_Post","surface_form":"The New York Post","offset":1760},{"uri":"GQ","surface_form":"GQ","offset":1856},{"uri":"Fidel_Castro","surface_form":"Fidel Castro","offset":2089},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":2174},{"uri":"Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro","surface_form":"Nicol\u00E1s Maduro","offset":2184},{"uri":"Crisis_in_Venezuela","surface_form":"crisis","offset":2332},{"uri":"Shortages_in_Venezuela","surface_form":"shortages in Venezuela","offset":2343}]}
