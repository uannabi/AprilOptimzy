{"id":700774,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Russian ruble or rouble (\"rubl\u02B9\", plural: \"rubli\"; sign: \u20BD, \u0440\u0443\u0431; code: RUB) is the currency of Russia. It is also used in two partially recognized countries, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It is also used in the unrecognised republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. One ruble is subdivided into 100 \"kopeks\" (\"kopeyka\", plural: \"kopeyki\").\nThe ruble was the currency of the Russian Empire and of the Soviet Union (as the Soviet ruble). Only three countries, Russia, Belarus and Transnistria use currencies known as ruble. The ruble was the world's first decimal currency: it was decimalised in 1704 when the ruble became equal to 100 kopeks.\nIn 1992 the Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was replaced with the Russian ruble (code: RUR) at the rate 1 SUR = 1 RUR. In 1998, while Russia was suffering from a second economic crisis, the Russian ruble was redenominated with the new code \"RUB\" and was exchanged at the rate of 1 RUB = 1,000 RUR.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Currency_sign","surface_form":"sign","offset":68},{"uri":"%E2%82%BD","surface_form":"\u20BD","offset":74},{"uri":"ISO_4217","surface_form":"code","offset":82},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":112},{"uri":"Abkhazia","surface_form":"Abkhazia","offset":175},{"uri":"South_Ossetia","surface_form":"South Ossetia","offset":188},{"uri":"Donetsk_People%27s_Republic","surface_form":"Donetsk","offset":252},{"uri":"Luhansk_People%27s_Republic","surface_form":"Luhansk","offset":264},{"uri":"Ruble","surface_form":"ruble","offset":351},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":381},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":407},{"uri":"Soviet_ruble","surface_form":"Soviet ruble","offset":428},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":473},{"uri":"Transnistria","surface_form":"Transnistria","offset":485},{"uri":"Ruble","surface_form":"currencies known as ruble","offset":502},{"uri":"Decimalisation","surface_form":"decimalised","offset":586},{"uri":"Soviet_ruble","surface_form":"Soviet ruble","offset":661},{"uri":"Monetary_reform_in_Russia%2C_1998","surface_form":"redenominated","offset":850}]}
