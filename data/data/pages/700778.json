It features an cast led by Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00E5rd, Emily Watson, and Paul Ritter. The series premiered in the United States and the United Kingdom on May 6\u20137, 2019. It received mostly positive reviews.\nPremise.\n\"Chernobyl\" dramatizes the story of the nuclear plant disaster which occurred in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Soviet Union), showing the stories of the people who caused the disaster and those who responded to it. The series depicts some of the least known stories of the disaster, including the efforts of the firefighters who were the first responders on the scene, volunteers, and teams of miners tasked with digging a critical tunnel.\nThe miniseries is based in large part on the memories of Pripyat locals, as told by Belarusian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich in her book \"Voices from Chernobyl\".\nDevelopment and writing.\nWriter Craig Mazin began researching for the project in 2014, by reading books and government reports from inside and outside of the Soviet Union. Mazin also interviewed nuclear scientists to learn how a reactor works, and former Soviet citizens to gain a better idea of the culture in 1986. Furthermore, Mazin read several first-person accounts in order to bring additional authenticity to the story. He explained, \"When you're reading the personal stories of people who were there\u00A0\u2014\u200Apeople who lived near the plant, people who worked at the plant, people who were sent to Chernobyl as part of the effort to clean it up\u00A0\u2014\u200Ain those individual accounts, that's really where the story came alive\".\nIn preparation for the miniseries, Mazin visited the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Mazin also did not cast any American actors, as that could potentially pull the audience out of the story.\nOn July 26, 2017, it was announced that HBO and Sky will produce a series named \"Chernobyl\". It was HBO's first co-production with Sky UK. The five-episode miniseries was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck. Mazin was the executive producer together with Carolyn Strauss and Jane Featherstone. Chris Fry and Renck acted as co-executive producers. On March 11, 2019, it was announced that the miniseries would premiere on May 6, 2019. On June 4, 2019, Craig Mazin made the original scripts of all episodes available for downloading in PDF format (see External links below).\nCasting.\nSimultaneously with the initial series announcement, it was confirmed that Jared Harris would star in the series. On March 19, 2018, it was announced that Stellan Skarsg\u00E5rd and Emily Watson had joined the main cast. In May 2018, it was announced that Paul Ritter, Jessie Buckley, Adrian Rawlins, and Con O'Neill also joined the cast.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography began in April 2018 in Lithuania. Initial filming started on May 13, 2018. The majority of the filmings took place in Fabijoni\u0161k\u0117s, a residential district in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Fabijoniskes has maintained an authentic Soviet atmosphere. Accordingly, it was used to portray the Ukrainian city of Pripyat. An area of densely built panel housing apartments served as a location for the evacuation scenes. Director Johan Renck heavily criticised the amount of diverse and eye-catching modern windows in the houses, but was not concerned about removing them in post-production. At the end of March, production moved to Visaginas, Lithuania, to shoot the exterior and interior of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, a decommissioned nuclear power station, also known as \"Chernobyl's sister\" due to its visual resemblance and the nuclear reactor design used at both Chernobyl and Ignalina (RBMK nuclear power reactor). In early June 2018, production moved to Ukraine to shoot minor final scenes. The filming of \"Chernobyl\" took 16 weeks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Historical_drama","surface_form":"historical drama","offset":31},{"uri":"Craig_Mazin","surface_form":"Craig Mazin","offset":125},{"uri":"Johan_Renck","surface_form":"Johan Renck","offset":153},{"uri":"Chernobyl_nuclear_disaster","surface_form":"Chernobyl nuclear disaster","offset":186},{"uri":"Cast","surface_form":"cast","offset":281},{"uri":"Jared_Harris","surface_form":"Jared Harris","offset":293},{"uri":"Stellan_Skarsg%C3%A5rd","surface_form":"Stellan Skarsg\u00E5rd","offset":307},{"uri":"Emily_Watson","surface_form":"Emily Watson","offset":326},{"uri":"Paul_Ritter_(actor)","surface_form":"Paul Ritter","offset":344},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":385},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":407},{"uri":"Chernobyl_disaster","surface_form":"nuclear plant disaster","offset":526},{"uri":"Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic","offset":571},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":608},{"uri":"Pripyat","surface_form":"Pripyat","offset":994},{"uri":"Svetlana_Alexievich","surface_form":"Svetlana Alexievich","offset":1047},{"uri":"Voices_from_Chernobyl","surface_form":"Voices from Chernobyl","offset":1080},{"uri":"Craig_Mazin","surface_form":"Craig Mazin","offset":1136},{"uri":"Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone","surface_form":"Chernobyl Exclusion Zone","offset":1878},{"uri":"Sky_UK","surface_form":"Sky UK","offset":2142},{"uri":"Johan_Renck","surface_form":"Johan Renck","offset":2221},{"uri":"Carolyn_Strauss","surface_form":"Carolyn Strauss","offset":2281},{"uri":"Jane_Featherstone","surface_form":"Jane Featherstone","offset":2301},{"uri":"PDF","surface_form":"PDF","offset":2560},{"uri":"Jared_Harris","surface_form":"Jared Harris","offset":2683},{"uri":"Stellan_Skarsg%C3%A5rd","surface_form":"Stellan Skarsg\u00E5rd","offset":2763},{"uri":"Emily_Watson","surface_form":"Emily Watson","offset":2785},{"uri":"Paul_Ritter_(actor)","surface_form":"Paul Ritter","offset":2859},{"uri":"Jessie_Buckley","surface_form":"Jessie Buckley","offset":2872},{"uri":"Adrian_Rawlins","surface_form":"Adrian Rawlins","offset":2888},{"uri":"Con_O%27Neill_(actor)","surface_form":"Con O'Neill","offset":2908},{"uri":"Principal_photography","surface_form":"Principal photography","offset":2951},{"uri":"Fabijoni%C5%A1k%C4%97s","surface_form":"Fabijoni\u0161k\u0117s","offset":3091},{"uri":"Vilnius","surface_form":"Vilnius","offset":3131},{"uri":"Pripyat","surface_form":"Pripyat","offset":3284},{"uri":"Visaginas","surface_form":"Visaginas","offset":3603},{"uri":"Ignalina_Nuclear_Power_Plant","surface_form":"Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant","offset":3667},{"uri":"RBMK","surface_form":"RBMK","offset":3870}]}
