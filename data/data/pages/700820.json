{"id":700820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring","text":"The liberalisation and democratisation efforts of Alexander Dubchek and Czechoslovakia's Communist Party, known as Prague Spring, took place in 1968. As the Soviet Union thought that Czechoslovakia was moving away of communism, an alliance of Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia on August 20-21, 1968. Immidiately after the invasion, a series of protests took place in Czechoslovakia.\nPrague Spring symbolizes the experiment of establishing of a socialism with a human face, in postwar Eastern Bloc and its violent suppression from Warsaw Pact countries in August 21, 1968. The event is included in a greater series of Cold War-related unrests. Some examples are May 1968 in France, the student protests against Vietnam War and the military junta in Greece (1967-1974).\nAfter the invasion, the most reforms who took place during Prague Spring were reversed or halted. This period after Prague Spring is known as normalization. The only exception was the federalisation of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia became officialy a federal country on January 1, 1969.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alexander_Dub%C4%8Dek","surface_form":"Alexander Dubchek","offset":50},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia's Communist Party","offset":72},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia","offset":183},{"uri":"Warsaw_Pact","surface_form":"Warsaw Pact","offset":243},{"uri":"Socialism_with_a_human_face","surface_form":"socialism with a human face","offset":455},{"uri":"May_1968","surface_form":"May 1968","offset":672},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":721},{"uri":"Greek_military_junta_of_1967-1974","surface_form":"military junta in Greece (1967-1974)","offset":741}]}
