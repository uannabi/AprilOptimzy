{"id":700894,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealandia","text":"Zealandia, also known as the New Zealand continent or Tasmantis, is an almost underwater continent, which sank after separating from Australia 60\u201385 million years ago and from Antarctica 130\u201385 million years ago. It was underwater about 23 million years ago, and most of it is sunken (over 93%) under the Pacific Ocean.\nThe continent of Zealandia has an area of \u200B\u200B3.5 million km2, is larger than Greenland or India, and almost half the size of Australia. It is very long and narrow, from New Caledonia in the north and south beyond the sub-Antarctic Islands of New Zealand in the south. New Zealand is the largest part of Zealandia that is above sea \u200B\u200Blevel, followed by New Caledonia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":133},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":176},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":305},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":396},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":409},{"uri":"New_Caledonia","surface_form":"New Caledonia","offset":488},{"uri":"New_Zealand_Subantarctic_Islands","surface_form":"sub-Antarctic Islands of New Zealand","offset":536},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":587},{"uri":"Sea_%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Blevel","surface_form":"sea \u200B\u200Blevel","offset":646}]}
