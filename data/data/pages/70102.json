{"id":70102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam","text":"Diazepam is a benzodiazepine which has a relatively long half-life. It is mostly used to treat anxiety, certain forms of epilepsy, muscle spasms (where the muscle moves on its own, causing pain), and sleeping problems. Like with other benzodiazepines, there is a risk of addiction if used for long periods of this. For this reason the drug is used to treat acute cases (2-4 weeks maximum) to avoid dependence. According to the World Health Organization diazepam is an \"essential drug\".\nDiazepam is marketed under a number of names; its original trade name was \"Valium\". It has been the most prescribed medicine in the United States many times. It is sometimes used recreationally to cause a calming effect.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Benzodiazepine","surface_form":"benzodiazepine","offset":14},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half-life","offset":57},{"uri":"Anxiety","surface_form":"anxiety","offset":95},{"uri":"Epilepsy","surface_form":"epilepsy","offset":121},{"uri":"Insomnia","surface_form":"sleeping problems","offset":200},{"uri":"Addiction","surface_form":"addiction","offset":271},{"uri":"Acute","surface_form":"acute","offset":357},{"uri":"World_Health_Organization","surface_form":"World Health Organization","offset":427},{"uri":"WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines","surface_form":"essential drug","offset":469},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":618}]}
