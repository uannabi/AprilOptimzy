He worked at the Biozentrum University of Basel. Reichert investigated the role of neural stem cells in the development of the brain using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model. He discovered a molecular production program followed by stem cells as they develop in the brain.\nFrom 1986 to 1991 he was a faculty member at the University of Geneva before returning to the University of Basel. Reichert remained as a professor at the Zoological Institute until 2006, when he moved to the Biozentrum of the University of Basel where he continued to teach and research.\nReichert died on June 13, 2019 in Basel, Switzerland at the age of 69.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":47},{"uri":"Biozentrum_University_of_Basel","surface_form":"Biozentrum","offset":104},{"uri":"University_of_Basel","surface_form":"University of Basel","offset":115},{"uri":"Neurogenesis","surface_form":"neural stem cells","offset":170},{"uri":"Brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":214},{"uri":"Drosophila","surface_form":"Drosophila","offset":240},{"uri":"Molecular","surface_form":"molecular","offset":279},{"uri":"University_of_Geneva","surface_form":"University of Geneva","offset":410},{"uri":"Basel","surface_form":"Basel","offset":684}]}
