{"id":70121,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Antarctic_Territory","text":"The British Antarctic Territory is a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom and is a British overseas territory. It is a triangle in Antarctica from the South Pole to 60\u00B0 S latitude between longitudes 20\u00B0 W and 80\u00B0 W. The Territory was formed on March 3, 1962, although the UK first claimed this part of the Antarctic in 1908. Before 1962, the area now covered by the Territory comprised three separate dependencies of the Falkland Islands;\nThe Territory overlaps other claims on Antarctica by Argentina and Chile\nThe Territory is inhabited largely by the staff of research and support stations operated and maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and other organisations.\nHistory.\nThe United Kingdom has had a presence in the South Atlantic since 1833 when it occupied the Falkland Islands. In 1908 the UK claimed the territory that is British Antarctic Territory today, as well as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The territory was governed as three separate dependencies; Graham Land, the South Orkneys, and the South Shetlands, administered from Falkland Islands by the Governor.\nGeography.\nIn addition to continental Antarctica, within which the BAT claim includes the Palmer Land peninsula, and the Ronne Ice Shelf, Weddell Sea, the territory also includes the South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands.\nAdministration.\nIt is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). A Commissioner is appointed and is always the Head of the FCO's Overseas Territories Department.\nThe Territory has a full suite of laws, and legal and postal administrations. Given the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System, the Territory does not enforce its laws on foreign nations who maintain scientific bases within the Territory. It is self-financing, with income from the sale of postage stamps and income tax.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":47},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":73},{"uri":"Triangle","surface_form":"triangle","offset":133},{"uri":"South_Pole","surface_form":"South Pole","offset":165},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":286},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":435},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":506},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":520},{"uri":"British_Antarctic_Survey","surface_form":"British Antarctic Survey","offset":638},{"uri":"South_Atlantic","surface_form":"South Atlantic","offset":742},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":789},{"uri":"South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands","surface_form":"South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands","offset":898},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"Governor","offset":1102},{"uri":"Palmer_Land","surface_form":"Palmer Land","offset":1202},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":1214},{"uri":"Ronne_Ice_Shelf","surface_form":"Ronne Ice Shelf","offset":1233},{"uri":"Weddell_Sea","surface_form":"Weddell Sea","offset":1250},{"uri":"South_Shetland_Islands","surface_form":"South Shetland Islands","offset":1295},{"uri":"South_Orkney_Islands","surface_form":"South Orkney Islands","offset":1322},{"uri":"Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office","surface_form":"Foreign and Commonwealth Office","offset":1386},{"uri":"Commissioner_of_the_British_Antarctic_Territory","surface_form":"Commissioner","offset":1427},{"uri":"Antarctic_Treaty_System","surface_form":"Antarctic Treaty System","offset":1628}]}
