{"id":701221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_130_Graf_Zeppelin","text":"The LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin \u0399\u0399 was the last Zeppelin built in the time between World War 1 and World War 2. Built from the same blueprints as its sister the LZ-129 Hindenburg, in October, 1937, LZ-130 was modified to use helium after the LZ-129 Hindenburg crash, delaying her first flight. Because helium provides less lift than hydrogen, LZ-130\u2019s passenger capacity was reduced from the 72 carried by Hindenburg to just 40.\nHelium is rare and expensive, so the airship was also modified to not leak helium. However, the United States refused to sell any helium to Germany, so the airship was filled with hydrogen anyway.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"LZ_129_Hindenburg","surface_form":"LZ-129 Hindenburg","offset":154},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":218},{"uri":"LZ_129_Hindenburg","surface_form":"LZ-129 Hindenburg crash","offset":235},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":326}]}
