{"id":702,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_River","text":"The Saint Lawrence River (; Tuscarora: \"Kahnaw\u00E1\u02BCkye\"; Mohawk: \"Kaniatarowanenneh\", meaning \"big waterway\") is a big river in eastern North America. It flows between the Canadian province of Quebec & Ontario and the American state of New York, and through the major canadian city of Montreal. It is the third largest river in Canada.\nThe river drains water from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean. It is more than three thousand kilometres long. The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big \"estuary\" or bay, the biggest in the world; this is called the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\nThe Canadian cities of Kingston, Montreal, Trois-Rivi\u00E8res and Quebec City are on this river. The Saint Lawrence Seaway allows ships to go up the river and through the Great Lakes right into the middle of North America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tuscarora_language","surface_form":"Tuscarora","offset":28},{"uri":"Mohawk_language","surface_form":"Mohawk","offset":54},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":116},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":133},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":169},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":178},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":190},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":199},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":215},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":224},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":233},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":282},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":365},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":386},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":433},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":495},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Saint_Lawrence","surface_form":"Gulf of Saint Lawrence","offset":557},{"uri":"Kingston","surface_form":"Kingston","offset":604},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":614},{"uri":"Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res%2C_Quebec","surface_form":"Trois-Rivi\u00E8res","offset":624},{"uri":"Quebec_City","surface_form":"Quebec City","offset":643},{"uri":"Saint_Lawrence_Seaway","surface_form":"Saint Lawrence Seaway","offset":678},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":707}]}
