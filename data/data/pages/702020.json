Also known as ISRO, the organisation has made many successes since its creation in 1969. It built and launched the Mars Orbiter Mission which made India the first country to get to Mars on its first try.\nCreation.\nOrganised research about space in India was led by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai and Homi Bhaba. Bhaba was the secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy when it was founded in 1950. He supported Sarabhai in creating India's first rocket launch station. In 1962, the Indian National Committee for Space Research was set up by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1969, ISRO was created to follow INCOSPAR.\nSpace flight programs.\nLike other space programs, ISRO has had many successes and failures. In the beginning, ISRO built satellites that were then launched by other countries, like the Soviet Union. Later, ISRO built many types of rockets. Some of those rockets are now decommissioned, meaning ISRO does not use them anymore. In the future, India also wants to send people to space and send more missions to other planets.\nLaunch vehicles.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s India began its own rocket program. ISRO has had five different types of rockets.\nThe Satellite Launch Vehicle was a 4-stage solid-propellant light launcher. It was supposed to be tall and be able to carry. The first launch was in 1979 and launched every year until 1983. It launched successfully for the first time on July 18, 1980. This means that India is the sixth country to get spaceflight by itself. It is now decomissioned.\nThe Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle was a five-stage solid propellant rocket. It was able to carry into low Earth orbit. The design was based on the SLV and the project started in the 1980s. The rocket was tested in 1987, 1988, 1992, and 1994 and only two of them were successful. It is now decommissioned.\nThe Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle uses an expendable launch system to carry things into space. It is still in use.\nThe Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle also uses an expendable launch system, this time to launch INSAT-type satellites. Currently it is India's second-heaviest launch vehicle and can launch up to into low Earth orbit. There are multiple marks, or versions of this rocket. It is still in use.\nSatellites.\nIndia's first satellite, which was called the Aryabhata, was launched by the Soviet Union. Since then India has built and launched many different satellites.\nRohini series.\nRohini is a series of four satellites. These satellites were launched by the Satellite Launch Vehicle, and three of them were able to make it into orbit.\nINSAT series.\nThe Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) is a series of satellites built and launched by ISRO. These help India with telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search-and-rescue.\nIRS series.\nThe Indian Remote Sensing satellites (IRS) are a series of satellites built and launched by ISRO. It is the largest series of remote sensing satellites for regular people in the world.\nRadar Imagine Satellites.\nIndia has two Radar Imaging Satellites (RISAT).\nSouth Asia Satellite.\nThe South Asia Satellite is a communications satellite launched in 2017 as a gift to the other countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.\nGPS-aided geo-augmented navigation satellite system.\nAlso known as GAGAN, this is a national plan for satellite navigation.\nIRNSS satellite navigation system.\nThe Independent Regional Navigation Satellite System is made to have accurate position information to people in India as well as 1500 km from its borders. It is made like this because in bad situations, people cannot rely on GPS. ISRO first planned to launch the satellites between 2012 and 2014, but it had to be moved to later years.\nHuman spaceflight.\nThe first Indian cosmonaut is Rakesh Sharma, who flew with two Russians in Salyut 7 in 1984. The first female Indian astronaut was Kalpana Chawla. She died in in 2003. The second female Indian astronaut, Sunita Williams, spent 321 days 17 hours 15 minutes in space.\nExploring other planets.\nIn 2008 ISRO sent Chandrayaan-1 to the moon. It helped discover evidence of water on the moon. ISRO flew the Mars Orbiter Mission in 2013 and it reached Mars in 2014, making India the 4th country to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mars.\nFuture.\nChandrayaan-2 is the India's second moon mission. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019 at 2:43 PM IST (09:13 UTC) to the Moon by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III). It includes an orbiter, lander, and rover that will study the moon both on and above the surface. The mission spent some time orbiting Earth before going to the moon. The lander will reach the lunar south pole on 7 September 2019 at 01:55 IST (6 September 2019, 20:25 UTC). Other than Chandrayaan-2, ISRO may team up with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, for a mission looking for water on the Moon.\nThe next Mars mission will be the Mars Orbiter Mission 2, and will be launched in 2022 or 2023.\nThe first mission to the Sun will be a probe called Aditya-L1. It was originally planned for 2012, but was delayed to 2021. It will study solar wind and space weather.\nThe first mission to Venus will be an orbiter mission called Shukrayaan-1, that may launch in 2023.\nIn 2018, prime minister Narendra Modi said that India will send astronauts into space by 2022.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":56},{"uri":"Space_exploration","surface_form":"space exploration","offset":78},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":100},{"uri":"Mars_Orbiter_Mission","surface_form":"Mars Orbiter Mission","offset":226},{"uri":"Vikram_Sarabhai","surface_form":"Vikram Sarabhai","offset":392},{"uri":"Homi_J._Bhaba","surface_form":"Homi Bhaba","offset":412},{"uri":"Department_of_Atomic_Energy","surface_form":"Department of Atomic Energy","offset":455},{"uri":"Indian_National_Committee_for_Space_Research","surface_form":"Indian National Committee for Space Research","offset":596},{"uri":"Jawaharlal_Nehru","surface_form":"Jawaharlal Nehru","offset":685},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":934},{"uri":"Rockets","surface_form":"rockets","offset":980},{"uri":"Satellite_Launch_Vehicle","surface_form":"Satellite Launch Vehicle","offset":1302},{"uri":"Augmented_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle","surface_form":"Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle","offset":1652},{"uri":"Low_Earth_orbit","surface_form":"low Earth orbit","offset":1755},{"uri":"Polar_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle","surface_form":"Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle","offset":1962},{"uri":"Expendable_launch_system","surface_form":"expendable launch system","offset":2001},{"uri":"Geosynchronous_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle","surface_form":"Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle","offset":2078},{"uri":"Aryabhata_(satellite)","surface_form":"Aryabhata","offset":2430},{"uri":"Rohini_(satellite)","surface_form":"Rohini","offset":2557},{"uri":"Indian_National_Satellite_System","surface_form":"Indian National Satellite System","offset":2729},{"uri":"Telecommunications","surface_form":"telecommunications","offset":2846},{"uri":"Indian_Remote_Sensing_satellites","surface_form":"Indian Remote Sensing satellites","offset":2932},{"uri":"Radar_Imaging_Satellite","surface_form":"Radar Imaging Satellites","offset":3153},{"uri":"South_Asia_Satellite","surface_form":"South Asia Satellite","offset":3213},{"uri":"South_Asian_Association_for_Regional_Cooperation","surface_form":"South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation","offset":3321},{"uri":"Independent_Regional_Navigation_Satellite_System","surface_form":"Independent Regional Navigation Satellite System","offset":3534},{"uri":"GPS","surface_form":"GPS","offset":3755},{"uri":"Cosmonaut","surface_form":"cosmonaut","offset":3902},{"uri":"Rakesh_Sharma","surface_form":"Rakesh Sharma","offset":3915},{"uri":"Salyut_7","surface_form":"Salyut 7","offset":3960},{"uri":"Kalpana_Chawla","surface_form":"Kalpana Chawla","offset":4016},{"uri":"Sunita_Williams","surface_form":"Sunita Williams","offset":4089},{"uri":"Chandrayaan_1","surface_form":"Chandrayaan-1","offset":4194},{"uri":"Mars_Orbiter_Mission","surface_form":"Mars Orbiter Mission","offset":4285},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":4395},{"uri":"Chandrayaan-2","surface_form":"Chandrayaan-2","offset":4422},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":4549},{"uri":"Geosynchronous_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle_Mark_III","surface_form":"Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III","offset":4559},{"uri":"Lunar_south_pole","surface_form":"lunar south pole","offset":4816},{"uri":"Japan_Aerospace_Exploration_Agency","surface_form":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency","offset":4949},{"uri":"Mars_Orbiter_Mission_2","surface_form":"Mars Orbiter Mission 2","offset":5073},{"uri":"Aditya-L1","surface_form":"Aditya-L1","offset":5187},{"uri":"Shukrayaan-1","surface_form":"Shukrayaan-1","offset":5364},{"uri":"Narendra_Modi","surface_form":"Narendra Modi","offset":5427}]}
