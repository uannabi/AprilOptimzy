It is a growth habit or life habit which makes use of trees to reach light in natural habitats.\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"vine\" applies almost exclusively to the grapevine, whereas the term \"climber\" is used for all climbing plants. The grapevine, genus Vitis, carries berries which can be made into wine. In the United States, all climbing plants are called vines or ivies or sometimes creepers (like the Virigina Creeper).\nMost vines are flowering plants. These may be divided into woody vines or lianas, such as wisteria, kiwifruit, and common ivy, and herbaceous (nonwoody) vines, such as morning glory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Climbing_plant","surface_form":"climbing plant","offset":12},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stems","offset":37},{"uri":"Runner_(botany)","surface_form":"runners","offset":46},{"uri":"Life_habit","surface_form":"life habit","offset":153},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":215},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":384},{"uri":"Vitis","surface_form":"Vitis","offset":390},{"uri":"Berry","surface_form":"berries","offset":405},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":436},{"uri":"Virigina_Creeper","surface_form":"Virigina Creeper","offset":542},{"uri":"Flowering_plants","surface_form":"flowering plants","offset":576},{"uri":"Liana","surface_form":"liana","offset":635},{"uri":"Wisteria","surface_form":"wisteria","offset":651},{"uri":"Kiwifruit","surface_form":"kiwifruit","offset":661},{"uri":"Ivy","surface_form":"ivy","offset":683},{"uri":"Herbaceous","surface_form":"herbaceous","offset":692},{"uri":"Morning_glory","surface_form":"morning glory","offset":729}]}
