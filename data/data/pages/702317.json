He took the oath of office in Washington, DC on September 28. He made $2,000 per year. He agreed with people who wanted to make Kansas a slave state. He agreed with what the pro-slavery people in the territory wanted.\nWhile Governor Andrew Reeder was away from the territory, Woodson became acting governor.

Even though this first territorial legislature was seen as real by the federal government, free-staters called the laws \"bogus laws\".\nIn total, Woodson was acting governor for a little more than five months while governors Andrew Reeder, Wilson Shannon, and John W. Geary were away from the territory.\nLater life.\nWoodson spent his last years in Parker, Kansas.
