{"id":702357,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissected_Till_Plains","text":"The Dissected Till Plains are physiographic parts of the Central Lowlands province. In turn, those are part of the Interior Plains physiographic part of the United States. They are in southern and western Iowa, northeastern Kansas, the southwestern corner of Minnesota, northern Missouri, eastern Nebraska, and southeastern South Dakota.\nThe Dissected Till Plains were created by pre-Wisconsin glaciers during the Pre-Illinoian Stage. Glacial scouring and deposition by the Laurentide ice sheet and the later accumulation of loess during the Wisconsin Stage created the rolling hills and good, healthy dirt in the region.\nThe region is also the western edge of the Corn Belt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physiography","surface_form":"physiographic","offset":30},{"uri":"Interior_Plains","surface_form":"Interior Plains","offset":115},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":157},{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":205},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":224},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":259},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":279},{"uri":"Nebraska","surface_form":"Nebraska","offset":297},{"uri":"South_Dakota","surface_form":"South Dakota","offset":324},{"uri":"Pre-Illinoian","surface_form":"Pre-Illinoian Stage","offset":414},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"Glacial","offset":435},{"uri":"Laurentide_ice_sheet","surface_form":"Laurentide ice sheet","offset":474},{"uri":"Loess","surface_form":"loess","offset":525},{"uri":"Last_glacial_period","surface_form":"Wisconsin Stage","offset":542},{"uri":"Corn_Belt","surface_form":"Corn Belt","offset":665}]}
