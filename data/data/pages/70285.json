{"id":70285,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_jersey","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Yellow jersey (French: Maillot jaune [majo \u0292o\u02D0n]) is the jersey worn by the leader of many multi-day (or \"stage\") bicycle races, originally and most notably the Tour de France. It allows the rider who was in the overall lead at the end of the previous day to be easily identified.\nBecause the Tour de France was the first to use a coloured jersey to identify the leader many newer races have chosen the same colour, for example the Tour of Germany. Other tours and races use other colours, sometimes because of the sponsor.\nThe Giro d'Italia, Tour of Italy, have a pink jersey (maglia rosa). The race's original sponsor was the sports newspaper (La Gazzetta dello Sport) which printed on pink paper, like many European sports newspapers.\nThe leader in the Vuelta a Espa\u00F1a (Tour of Spain) wears a red jersey (called \"La Roja\"). From 1998 to 2010 the Vuelta leader's jersey was gold in color.\nSometimes a rider will get three yellow jerseys.\nThey will sometimes also autograph many copies of the jersey that are given out to VIPs with the race and their team.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":32},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":178},{"uri":"Sponsor","surface_form":"sponsor","offset":532},{"uri":"Giro_d%27Italia","surface_form":"Giro d'Italia","offset":545},{"uri":"Vuelta_a_Espa%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Vuelta a Espa\u00F1a","offset":773}]}
