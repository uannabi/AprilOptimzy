{"id":702941,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Journal-World","text":"The \"Lawrence Journal-World\" is a newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, United States, by Ogden Newspapers. They publish every day.\nHistory.\nThe \"Journal-World\" name started in 1911. The paper says it goes back to 1858.\nIn 1891, Wilford Collins Simons moved to Lawrence. He took over the \"Lawrence Record\" newspaper in a three-month lease. The \"Lawrence World\" was first issued by Simons on March 2, 1892.\nIn 1905, the \"World\" bought the \"Lawrence Journal\". They merged the \"Journal\" and \"World\" in 1911 after a fire destroyed the offices of the \"Journal\". The name \"Lawrence Daily Journal\" dates back to 1880. However, that name just continued the name \"Republican Daily Journal\". The name \"Republican Daily Journal\" dates back to at least 1869. The \"Republican Daily Journal\" seems to have been the successor through a sale and/or consolidation of earlier Lawrence newspapers. One of those papers dated to 1858. For years, the \"Journal-World\" said it started in 1858.\nWilford Collins Simons was editor from 1891 until his death in 1952.\nIn October 2010, the World Company, which owns the Lawrence Journal-World, sold some of its news media business. They sold it to Knology for $165 million. Knology is an Internet and cable company.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Journal-World's offices moved from the historic post office building on 7th and New Hampshire streets building to an office in North Lawrence. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas moved into the old building.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lawrence%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Lawrence, Kansas","offset":47},{"uri":"Ogden_Newspapers","surface_form":"Ogden Newspapers","offset":83},{"uri":"Merge","surface_form":"merged","offset":456},{"uri":"Successor","surface_form":"successor","offset":794},{"uri":"Consolidate","surface_form":"consolidation","offset":826}]}
