{"id":703035,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dynamics is the study of forces and their effects on motion over time. It is a branch of classical mechanics.\nIsaac Newton developed three laws of motion that are fundamental to dynamics.\nSome people consider dynamics to be made up of kinematics and kinetics. Others consider dynamics and kinematics to be separate, and do not use the word kinetics. Under the second view, kinematics is about describing how a system is at the moment, and dynamics is about how and why the system changes with time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Force","surface_form":"force","offset":38},{"uri":"Movement","surface_form":"motion","offset":66},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":78},{"uri":"Classical_mechanics","surface_form":"classical mechanics","offset":102},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton","surface_form":"Isaac Newton","offset":123},{"uri":"Newton%27s_laws_of_motion","surface_form":"three laws of motion","offset":146},{"uri":"Kinematics","surface_form":"kinematics","offset":248},{"uri":"Kinetics","surface_form":"kinetics","offset":263}]}
