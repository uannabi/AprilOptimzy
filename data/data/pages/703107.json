Students and staff run these activities under faculty sponsorship. Activities created by students, such as independent newspapers, are also very common.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":103},{"uri":"Curriculum","surface_form":"curriculum","offset":144},{"uri":"Volunteering","surface_form":"voluntary","offset":226},{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":263},{"uri":"Philanthropic","surface_form":"philanthropic","offset":271},{"uri":"Faculty_(teaching_staff)","surface_form":"faculty","offset":380},{"uri":"Sponsor","surface_form":"sponsorship","offset":388},{"uri":"Student_publication","surface_form":"independent newspapers","offset":441}]}
