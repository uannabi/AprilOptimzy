{"id":70311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escopetarra","text":"An \"escopetarra\" is a guitar made from a rifle; it is used as a symbol of peace. The name is a combination of the Spanish words \"escopeta\" (meaning shotgun/rifle) and \"guitarra\" (meaning guitar).\n\"Escopetarras\" were invented in 2003 by a Colombian peace activist named C\u00E9sar L\u00F3pez. At a gathering after the El Nogal Club bombing in Bogot\u00E1, he noticed a soldier holding a gun like a guitar and got the idea for it. The first \"escopetarra\" in 2003 was made from a Winchester rifle and a Stratocaster electric guitar.\nL\u00F3pez made five \"escopetarras\", four of which were given to Colombian musician Juanes, Argentine musician Fito P\u00E1ez, the United Nations Development Program, and the city government of Bogot\u00E1, while one was kept for himself. Juanes later sold his \"escopetarra\" for US$17,000 at a Beverly Hills fundraiser held to help victims of anti-personnel mines, while the \"escopetarra\" given to the UN was exhibited at the June 2006 of the UN Conference on Disarmament.\nIn 2006, L\u00F3pez got 12 more decommissioned AK-47s from Colombia's peace commissioner's office. After they are turned into guitars, he plans to give them to popular musicians such as Shakira, Carlos Santana, and Paul McCartney, as well as political figures such as the Dalai Lama. However, a member of the Dalai Lama's staff rejected L\u00F3pez' offer, saying it is not appropriate to give a weapon as a gift; L\u00F3pez has said he will try to explain his purpose more clearly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":22},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":41},{"uri":"Peace","surface_form":"peace","offset":74},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":114},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":238},{"uri":"Cesar_Lopez","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar L\u00F3pez","offset":269},{"uri":"2003_El_Nogal_Club_bombing","surface_form":"El Nogal Club bombing","offset":307},{"uri":"Bogot%C3%A1","surface_form":"Bogot\u00E1","offset":332},{"uri":"Winchester_rifle","surface_form":"Winchester rifle","offset":462},{"uri":"Stratocaster","surface_form":"Stratocaster","offset":485},{"uri":"Juanes","surface_form":"Juanes","offset":594},{"uri":"Fito_P%C3%A1ez","surface_form":"Fito P\u00E1ez","offset":621},{"uri":"United_Nations_Development_Program","surface_form":"United Nations Development Program","offset":636},{"uri":"Bogot%C3%A1","surface_form":"Bogot\u00E1","offset":699},{"uri":"Beverly_Hills","surface_form":"Beverly Hills","offset":794},{"uri":"Anti-personnel_mine","surface_form":"anti-personnel mine","offset":843},{"uri":"Conference_on_Disarmament","surface_form":"Conference on Disarmament","offset":946},{"uri":"AK-47","surface_form":"AK-47","offset":1015},{"uri":"Shakira","surface_form":"Shakira","offset":1154},{"uri":"Carlos_Santana","surface_form":"Carlos Santana","offset":1163},{"uri":"Paul_McCartney","surface_form":"Paul McCartney","offset":1183},{"uri":"Dalai_Lama","surface_form":"Dalai Lama","offset":1240}]}
