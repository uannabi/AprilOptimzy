{"id":703163,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shukrayaan-1","text":"e=\"preserve\">Shukrayaan-1 (\u0936\u0941\u0915\u094D\u0930\u092F\u093E\u0928-\u0967 or Venus craft) is a orbiter to Venus by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to study the surface and atmosphere of Venus. It is not known whether it will actually happen, this is just an idea.\nIn 2017 there was enough money to do research about doing this mission. If all of the costs are paid for, then this mission will launch in the early 2020s. The Government of India, in 2017\u201318 gave the Department of Space a 23% increase in money. Under the space sciences section, the money is for \"for Mars Orbiter Mission II and Mission to Venus\".\nFrom 2016 to 2017, ISRO worked together with JAXA to study the atmosphere of Venus using signals from the Akatsuki Venus orbiter. ISRO and France (CNES) are talking about working together on this mission and jointly develop aerobraking technologies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["spaceflight/IP"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Venus","offset":70},{"uri":"Indian_Space_Research_Organisation","surface_form":"Indian Space Research Organisation","offset":83},{"uri":"Atmosphere_of_Venus","surface_form":"atmosphere of Venus","offset":150},{"uri":"Department_of_Space","surface_form":"Department of Space","offset":443},{"uri":"Japan_Aerospace_Exploration_Agency","surface_form":"JAXA","offset":636},{"uri":"Atmosphere_of_Venus","surface_form":"atmosphere of Venus","offset":654},{"uri":"Akatsuki_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Akatsuki Venus orbiter","offset":697},{"uri":"CNES","surface_form":"CNES","offset":738},{"uri":"Aerobraking","surface_form":"aerobraking","offset":815}]}
