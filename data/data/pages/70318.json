{"id":70318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Garin","text":"e=\"preserve\">Maurice Garin (March 3 1871 - February 19 1957) was a road bicycle racer. He is best known for winning the 1903 Tour de France - the very first running of the race.\nGarin was born in Arvier in the Aosta Valley in north-west Italy. He became a naturalized French citizen only in December 1901, when he was already a champion cyclist, winner of the second Paris-Roubaix.\nHe was declared the winner of the 1904 Tour de France, but was later disqualified. The Tour de France organisation and the French cycling authorities have not said why. They were said to have taken a train through part of the route. In the early days stages were much longer than today, sometimes starting in the dark.\nWhen he retired from professional cycling he ran a small garage in Lens until his death.\nHe is buried in the Cimeti\u00E8re Est in the neighbouring suburb of Sallaumines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"March_3","surface_form":"March 3","offset":28},{"uri":"1871","surface_form":"1871","offset":36},{"uri":"February_19","surface_form":"February 19","offset":43},{"uri":"1957","surface_form":"1957","offset":55},{"uri":"Cyclist","surface_form":"road bicycle racer","offset":67},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":125},{"uri":"Arvier","surface_form":"Arvier","offset":196},{"uri":"Aosta_Valley","surface_form":"Aosta Valley","offset":210},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":237},{"uri":"Lens%2C_Pas-de-Calais","surface_form":"Lens","offset":768}]}
