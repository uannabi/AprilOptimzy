{"id":703217,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waybuloo","text":"\"Waybuloo\" is a British-Canadian children's television series.\nYogo.\nYogo is a light form of Yoga practiced by the four main characters in the series. The characters, known as Piplings, demonstrate several poses inspired by things they see in their homeworld, Nara, such as owls, trees, and insects.\nWhen the children (or Cheebies) arrive later during an episode, they then practice the same poses demonstrated by the Piplings at the start of the show.\nThe cue for both the Piplings and the Cheebies to perform Yogo is an ancient machine, which activates when sunlight falls upon it.\nYogo was developed by the show's producers in association with a Paediatrician and a Health and Safety Consultant. The leaflet produced by the BBC warns parents not to practise Yogo with their children if they are or have been ill, and always to speak to a GP before starting the program.\nSeries 1 and 2.\nFootnote 1: S02E38 does not have a title recorded, although it has been aired by the BBC.\nSeries 3 and 4.\nDecode Entertainment stated that two more CGI seasons of \"Waybuloo\" will be made. Series 3 was aired on CBeebies beginning 3 October 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yoga","surface_form":"Yoga","offset":93},{"uri":"Paediatrician","surface_form":"Paediatrician","offset":649},{"uri":"General_Practitioner","surface_form":"GP","offset":841},{"uri":"Decode_Entertainment","surface_form":"Decode Entertainment","offset":995},{"uri":"CBeebies","surface_form":"CBeebies","offset":1099}]}
