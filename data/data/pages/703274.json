{"id":703274,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Bass","text":"Randy William Bass (born March 13, 1954) is an American former baseball player. He is less notable for his career in Major League Baseball than for his success in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Hanshin Tigers.\nBass came up with the Minnesota Twins as a first baseman in 1977. In his six seasons in the Major Leagues he was never a day-to-day player, usually coming off the bench just to pinch hit. After his contract expired following the 1982 season, Bass signed with the Hanshin Tigers who made him their starting first baseman. Bass is often credited with single-handedly turning around the fortunes of the Tigers, which ultimately resulted in the team's pennant run and Japan Series title in 1985.\nBass adapted quickly to Japanese pitching, hitting 35 home runs in his first season in 1983, and became the Tigers' star slugger for several seasons. He won four consecutive league batting titles; in 1986, he nearly became the first player in Japan to bat.400, finishing the season with a.389 average. Bass won consecutive batting Triple Crowns (1985 and 1986).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
