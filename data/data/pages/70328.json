{"id":70328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Roubaix","text":"Paris-Roubaix is a famous single-day professional bicycle road race held in northern France starting in Compi\u00E8gne and finishing in Roubaix, near the Belgian frontier. It was one of the ten UCI Road World Cup races and became part of the UCI ProTour. It is one of the 'Classic cycle races' has the nickname \"The Hell of the North\".\nHistory.\nParis-Roubaix is one of the oldest professional bicycle races. Th\u00E9o Vienne and Maurice Perez got the idea to run the race and in 1896, the sports newspaper Le V\u00E9lo worked out original route between Paris and Roubaix. The race has been contested every year since 1896, stopped only by the two World wars.\nThe first edition of the race was held at Easter, April 19 1896, so it got the nickname of \"La Pascale\"(English: \"The Easter\").\n188 competitors left the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris and raced almost 300\u00A0kilometres to Roubaix. Josef Fischer, the winner of this first edition, received 1000 francs.\nThe race is now organised by the media group Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) who also run the Tour de France.\nRiders are often covered from head to toe in mud and grit, and race over the cobblestoned roads and hard rutted tracks of northern France. However, the race got the nickname \"l'enfer du Nord\", or the \"Hell of the North\" from journalists who watched the race after world war I, and saw it pass through many of the ruins, craters, and destruction along the way.\nOriginally, the race was from Paris to Roubaix, but in 1966 the starting location was moved to Chantilly, 50\u00A0kilometres to the north of Paris, to be moved in 1977 to Compi\u00E8gne, approximately 80\u00A0kilometres to the north of Paris. Famous for rough terrain, the route of Paris-Roubaix is adjusted slightly from year to year as the older roads are resurfaced and the race organisers seek to replace them with other challenging cobbles, to maintain the character of the race - in 2005, for example, the race included 54.7\u00A0kilometres of cobbled sections. The race finishes with 750\u00A0meters on the smooth concrete expanses of the large outdoor velodrome in Roubaix.\nThe bicycles of Paris-Roubaix.\nDue to its challenging course, and poor weather conditions, Paris-Roubaix presents a challenge to riders, team support personnel, and equipment alike. Special frames and wheels are often used specifically for Paris-Roubaix, in various configurations depending on the weather conditions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Road_bicycle_racing","surface_form":"bicycle road race","offset":50},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":85},{"uri":"Compi%C3%A8gne","surface_form":"Compi\u00E8gne","offset":104},{"uri":"Roubaix","surface_form":"Roubaix","offset":131},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgian","offset":149},{"uri":"UCI_Road_World_Cup","surface_form":"UCI Road World Cup","offset":189},{"uri":"UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"UCI ProTour","offset":237},{"uri":"Classic_race","surface_form":"Classic cycle races","offset":268},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":686},{"uri":"April_19","surface_form":"April 19","offset":694},{"uri":"1896","surface_form":"1896","offset":703},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":748},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":822},{"uri":"Roubaix","surface_form":"Roubaix","offset":863},{"uri":"Josef_Fischer","surface_form":"Josef Fischer","offset":872},{"uri":"Amaury_Sport_Organisation","surface_form":"Amaury Sport Organisation","offset":988},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":1037},{"uri":"1966","surface_form":"1966","offset":1468},{"uri":"Chantilly","surface_form":"Chantilly","offset":1508},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":1571},{"uri":"Compi%C3%A8gne","surface_form":"Compi\u00E8gne","offset":1579},{"uri":"Paris-Roubaix_2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":1887},{"uri":"Velodrome","surface_form":"velodrome","offset":2048},{"uri":"Roubaix","surface_form":"Roubaix","offset":2061},{"uri":"Bicycle_frame","surface_form":"frames","offset":2260},{"uri":"Bicycle_wheel","surface_form":"wheels","offset":2271}]}
