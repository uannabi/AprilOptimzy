{"id":70339,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality","text":"e=\"preserve\">Asexuality is a sexual orientation. Asexual people usually do not have sexual attraction towards anyone, no matter what gender they are. Asexuality has nothing to do with a person's romantic/aesthetic/sensual attraction. The opposite of an asexual is an \"allosexual\" or pansexual. Allosexuality means that you feel sexual desires.\nMeaning.\nAsexuality is described as a spectrum. Demisexual people are on the asexual spectrum. They feel sexual attraction, but only to people who they feel a connection to. About 1% of people identify as asexual. Alfred Kinsey used the label \"X\" to describe asexual people. Grey-asexual people are people who feel like they are not asexual, but they're not sexual either. For example, a grey-asexual person doesn't feel sexual attraction often. Some asexuals also identify with a romantic identity as well, meaning they may feel the need to form relationships, while others may not. Some asexual people identify as queer. However, some people think that 'queer' is not an appropriate word for asexual people. Not having sex (celibacy), is not always asexuality. Some homosexuals, for example, don't want to have sex because they feel guilty about their sexual attraction.\nStudies.\nIn 2001, David Jay started the Asexual Visibility and Education Network. A 2012 study found that asexual people are just as discriminated against as gay men, lesbians, or bisexuals. Asexuality has only recently been studied. One writer, S.E. Smith speculates that it has not increased, its just people have only just started noticing it. Acceptance of asexuality as a subject of scientific has only begun recently.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":29},{"uri":"Sexual_attraction","surface_form":"sexual attraction","offset":84},{"uri":"Pansexuality","surface_form":"pansexual","offset":283},{"uri":"Alfred_Kinsey","surface_form":"Alfred Kinsey","offset":558},{"uri":"Queer","surface_form":"queer","offset":960},{"uri":"Celibacy","surface_form":"celibacy","offset":1070},{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"homosexuals","offset":1112},{"uri":"Discriminated","surface_form":"discriminated","offset":1350},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":1375},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":1384},{"uri":"Bisexuality","surface_form":"bisexuals","offset":1397}]}
