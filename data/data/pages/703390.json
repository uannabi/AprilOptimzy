The future of Frederick is unknown because Rice County isn't able to un-incorporate the city. State law says that residents must bring a petition to the city council. Then a special election will be called for a vote. Since there isn't a city council, it can't happen.\nIn November 2016, the community voted on whether to un-incorporate Frederick. Election workers at the Eureka Township voting location made a mistake. They accidentally gave the wrong ballots to township residents who didn't actually live in Frederick. 20 people voted. 13 voted to keep the city, but only 9 people live in Frederick. The mistake was noticed more than a week after the vote was certified. There is only a 5 day window to contest a vote. Because of this, Kansas Law kept the results.
