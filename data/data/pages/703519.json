Officially, he is elected every five years by the Federal Supreme Council, but because the ruler of Abu Dhabi customarily also holds the presidency of the UAE, the office is \"de facto\" hereditary. The President is also Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and Chairman of the Supreme Council and Supreme Petroleum Council.\nThe current President is Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Khalifa became President on 3 November 2004, following the death of his father, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":49},{"uri":"United_Arab_Emirates","surface_form":"United Arab Emirates","offset":70},{"uri":"Federal_Supreme_Council","surface_form":"Federal Supreme Council","offset":142},{"uri":"Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi","surface_form":"Abu Dhabi","offset":192},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":267},{"uri":"Hereditary","surface_form":"hereditary","offset":277},{"uri":"Union_Defence_Force_(UAE)","surface_form":"UAE Armed Forces","offset":336},{"uri":"Khalifa_bin_Zayed_Al_Nahyan","surface_form":"Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan","offset":445},{"uri":"Zayed_bin_Sultan_Al_Nahyan","surface_form":"Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan","offset":561}]}
