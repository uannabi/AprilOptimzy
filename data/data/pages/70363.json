It points to the directions of north, south, east and west. It is the smallest modern constellation. It was first described by the Italian navigator Andrea Corsali in 1515.\nIn the past, sailors used to use Crux as a means of navigation.\nThe Southern Cross was used on the flag flown by miners in Ballarat, Victoria, during the rebellion known as the Eureka Stockade. The Southern Cross flag has been used as a symbol of protest in Australia since 1854.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cygnus_(constellation)","surface_form":"Northern Cross","offset":93},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":131},{"uri":"North","surface_form":"north","offset":178},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":185},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"east","offset":192},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":201},{"uri":"Navigation","surface_form":"navigation","offset":372},{"uri":"Ballarat%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Ballarat, Victoria","offset":443},{"uri":"Eureka_Stockade","surface_form":"Eureka Stockade","offset":497},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":578}]}
