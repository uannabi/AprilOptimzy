{"id":703961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_sciences_of_history","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Auxiliary sciences of history are fields of study based on historical sources and items.\nMany of these fields of study started between the 16th and 19th centuries. At first, they were started by students of old artifacts. At the time, \"History\" was thought of only as a literary skill.\nIn the late 18th century the study of history became more empirical. This change was lead by the G\u00F6ttingen School of History. Then in the mid-19th century, Leopold von Ranke also focused on it. These changes lead to the rise of the trained historian as a skill.\nRelated pages.\nHistorical method","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Discipline_(study)","surface_form":"fields of study","offset":51},{"uri":"Historical_sources","surface_form":"historical sources","offset":76},{"uri":"Antiquarian","surface_form":"students of old artifacts","offset":212},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literary","offset":287},{"uri":"Empiricism","surface_form":"empirical","offset":361},{"uri":"G%C3%B6ttingen_School_of_History","surface_form":"G\u00F6ttingen School of History","offset":400},{"uri":"Leopold_von_Ranke","surface_form":"Leopold von Ranke","offset":459},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":543},{"uri":"Historical_method","surface_form":"Historical method","offset":580}]}
