Nearly 7\u00A0feet tall, Antetokounmpo's combination of size, speed and ball-handling skills led to his nickname the \"Greek Freak\". He is the 2019 NBA Most Valuable Player.\nBorn in Greece to Nigerian parents, Antetokounmpo began playing basketball for the youth teams of Filathlitikos in Athens. In 2011 he began playing for the club's senior team. He declared himself eligible for the NBA Draft in 2013 and was selected 15th overall by the Bucks.\nIn 2016\u201317 he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks (although totals are not the statistics used to determine league leaders, in which case the stat is not true; and several players have completed seasons with higher average ranks among the five statistics, such as Michael Jordan in 1987-88 and 1988-89).[3] He received the Most Improved Player award in 2017. He has received three All-Star selections, and led the Eastern Conference in voting in 2019. He was named NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) in June 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
