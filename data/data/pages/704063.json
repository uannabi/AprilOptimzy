It was created by Portland Mavericks left-handed pitcher Rob Nelson and bat boy Todd Field. It was then pitched to the Wrigley Company by Jim Bouton as a fun imitation of the tobacco-chewing.\nOver 800 million pouches of Big League Chew have been sold since 1980. Big League Chew was introduced in May 1980, it comes in flashy colors such as neon green (for their sour apple flavor) and bright purple (grape flavor).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bubble_gum","surface_form":"bubble gum","offset":30},{"uri":"Aluminum_foil","surface_form":"aluminum foil","offset":76},{"uri":"Portland_Mavericks","surface_form":"Portland Mavericks","offset":115},{"uri":"Rob_Nelson_(baseball)","surface_form":"Rob Nelson","offset":154},{"uri":"Todd_Field","surface_form":"Todd Field","offset":177},{"uri":"Wrigley_Company","surface_form":"Wrigley Company","offset":216},{"uri":"Jim_Bouton","surface_form":"Jim Bouton","offset":235},{"uri":"Chewing_tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco-chewing","offset":272}]}
