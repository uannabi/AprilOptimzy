{"id":70421,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eneco_Tour_of_Benelux","text":"The Eneco Tour of Benelux is a UCI ProTour bicycle stage race. Its name refers to its main sponsor, the energy company Eneco Energie. The first Eneco Tour of Benelux took place from August 3 to August 10 2005\nHistory.\nThe Tour of the Netherlands began on 6 May 1948, but only became an annual event in 1975. From about 2000 it was known as the Eneco tour. The start of the UCI's ProTour in 2005 saw the tour reorganised.\nOrganization.\nThe then UCI president Hein Verbruggen wanted to keep the Tour of the Netherlands for \"marketing reasons\". (Part of the UCI's job is to make cycling more popular). The Dutch Tour organisation got a better sponsor (ENECO Energie). But because the race was not difficult enough for the new ProTourthe race organisers asked the organisers of the Tour of Belgium and the Tour de Luxembourg. The idea was a Tour of the Benelux that would replace the three. The Tours of Belgium and Luxembourg will carry on. The organisers of the Tour of Luxembourg did not want to join the new big race, so the Eneco tour only covers Belgium and the Netherlands.\nGeneral classification.\nThe overall winner of the race by time wears a \"red jersey\" (Dutch: \"Rode trui\" or French: \"Maillot rouge\").\nPoints classification.\nIn 2005, the overall winner of the race by points (Dutch: \"Puntenklassement\") wears a \"blue jersey\" (Dutch: \"Blauwe trui\" or French: \"Maillot bleu\"). This was changed to a white jersey however in 2006.\nMountains classification.\nNo jersey is awarded for leading this classification.\nYoung rider classification.\nBefore 2007, the best young (under 25) rider of the race got to wear a \"yellow jersey\". (Dutch: \"Gele trui\" or French: \"Maillot jaune\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"UCI ProTour","offset":31},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"bicycle","offset":43},{"uri":"Stage_race","surface_form":"stage race","offset":51},{"uri":"Eneco_Energie","surface_form":"Eneco Energie","offset":119},{"uri":"August_3","surface_form":"August 3","offset":182},{"uri":"August_10","surface_form":"August 10","offset":194},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":204},{"uri":"6_May","surface_form":"6 May","offset":255},{"uri":"1948","surface_form":"1948","offset":261},{"uri":"Union_Cycliste_Internationale","surface_form":"UCI","offset":373},{"uri":"Hein_Verbruggen","surface_form":"Hein Verbruggen","offset":458},{"uri":"Tour_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Tour of Belgium","offset":778},{"uri":"Tour_de_Luxembourg","surface_form":"Tour de Luxembourg","offset":802},{"uri":"Benelux","surface_form":"Benelux","offset":849}]}
