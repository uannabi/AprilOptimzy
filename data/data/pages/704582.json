{"id":704582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_the_Virgin","text":"\"Jane the Virgin\" is an American romantic dramedy and satirical telenovela developed by Jennie Snyder Urman. The series premiered on October 13, 2014 on The CW. It is a loose adaptation of the Venezuelan telenovela \"Juana la Virgen\" created by Perla Far\u00EDas. The series stars Gina Rodriguez as Jane Villanueva, a devout 23-year-old Latina virgin, who becomes pregnant after an accidental artificial insemination by her gynecologist. The program parodies commonly used tropes and devices in Latin telenovelas.\nAt the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, \"Jane the Virgin\" was nominated for the award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy, received the Peabody Award, and Gina Rodriguez won the award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy. It was also selected as one of the top 10 Television Programs of 2014 by the American Film Institute.\nBeginning with the fourth episode of season three, the series's on-screen title card was modified, with \"The Virgin\" crossed out in favor of a substitution corresponding to each episode. This mirrored the storyline, in which Jane is no longer a virgin.\nOn April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a fifth and final season, which premiered on March 27, 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romantic_comedy","surface_form":"romantic","offset":33},{"uri":"Comedy-Drama","surface_form":"dramedy","offset":42},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satirical","offset":54},{"uri":"Telenovela","surface_form":"telenovela","offset":64},{"uri":"Jennie_Snyder_Urman","surface_form":"Jennie Snyder Urman","offset":88},{"uri":"The_CW","surface_form":"The CW","offset":153},{"uri":"Juana_la_virgen","surface_form":"Juana la Virgen","offset":216},{"uri":"Perla_Far%C3%ADas","surface_form":"Perla Far\u00EDas","offset":244},{"uri":"Gina_Rodriguez","surface_form":"Gina Rodriguez","offset":275},{"uri":"Virgin","surface_form":"virgin","offset":338},{"uri":"72nd_Golden_Globe_Awards","surface_form":"72nd Golden Globe Awards","offset":515},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Television_Series_%E2%80%93_Musical_or_Comedy","surface_form":"Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy","offset":591},{"uri":"Peabody_Award","surface_form":"Peabody Award","offset":648},{"uri":"Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Television_Series_Musical_or_Comedy","surface_form":"Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy","offset":700},{"uri":"American_Film_Institute","surface_form":"American Film Institute","offset":829}]}
