{"id":70459,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history","text":"Natural history is the study of plants and animals in the wild, and the environments they live in. This includes the geology of the places in which they live.\nThe work of naturalists is observation, interpretation, collecting and classification, rather than experiments. People who study natural history are called naturalists. They were among the first to explore the world. They were the first to study the Amazon and other tropical places. Naturalists find new species and classify plants and animals. They study ecology.\nNaturalists developed some theoretical ideas which were valuable. They noticed that living things fitted the lives they led. This was adaptation. They noticed a struggle for existence between animals. They thought they could see a chain of being from lower animals to higher, which they thought was the work of God. The idea that such things might happen by natural means began to surface in the 18th century, and become the majority view in time of Charles Darwin.\nBefore Darwin, most naturalists did not think of themselves as scientists. When they looked at nature, perhaps as explorers, they looked at everything. They looked at the land, the people, the plants and animals. After Darwin, they did see themselves as scientists. Early on, Darwin called himself a geologist. Thomas Henry Huxley was an anatomist. Joseph Dalton Hooker was a botanist. Charles Lyell was a geologist. They changed the way in which they were educated as well. They often took degrees in science. That sort of education was rare before Darwin.\nNaturalists were educated amateurs; scientists are trained professionals. The change happened slowly, during the 19th century. The very word \"scientist\" was invented in 1837 by William Whewell. Before then, the term was \"natural philosopher\" (for the physical sciences) or \"natural historian\" (for the biological sciences and geology). \"Naturalist\" is short for \"natural historian\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"study","offset":23},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":32},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":43},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":72},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":117},{"uri":"Observation","surface_form":"observation","offset":186},{"uri":"Interpretation","surface_form":"interpretation","offset":199},{"uri":"Collecting","surface_form":"collecting","offset":215},{"uri":"Classification","surface_form":"classification","offset":230},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":258},{"uri":"Amazon_Rainforest","surface_form":"Amazon","offset":409},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":426},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":464},{"uri":"Scientific_classification","surface_form":"classify","offset":476},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":516},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":552},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adaptation","offset":659},{"uri":"Struggle_for_existence","surface_form":"struggle for existence","offset":686},{"uri":"Chain_of_being","surface_form":"chain of being","offset":756},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":975},{"uri":"Geologist","surface_form":"geologist","offset":1291},{"uri":"Thomas_Henry_Huxley","surface_form":"Thomas Henry Huxley","offset":1302},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomist","offset":1329},{"uri":"Joseph_Dalton_Hooker","surface_form":"Joseph Dalton Hooker","offset":1340},{"uri":"Botanist","surface_form":"botanist","offset":1367},{"uri":"Charles_Lyell","surface_form":"Charles Lyell","offset":1377},{"uri":"Geologist","surface_form":"geologist","offset":1397},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"degrees","offset":1482},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"educated","offset":1566},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":1575},{"uri":"Training","surface_form":"trained","offset":1600},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":1608},{"uri":"William_Whewell","surface_form":"William Whewell","offset":1726}]}
