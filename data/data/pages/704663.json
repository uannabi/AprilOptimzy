It has ancient human remains and artifacts. These remains are 31,000 years old. Human teeth from the site have been used to analyze DNA. The results show that the people were \"Homo sapiens\". These people were different from already known people. The archaeologists have named them Ancient North Siberians. They are more like modern Europeans than like modern Asians.\nSiberia was very cold when these people lived.
