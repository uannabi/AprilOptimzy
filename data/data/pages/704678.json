{"id":704678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahumara","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Pahumara River is a river in the Barpeta district of Assam in India. It is located at latitude 26\u00B0 17'0\" and longitude 26\u00B017'0\". It is a tributary of the Brahmaputra River.\nIt flows through the areas of Puthimari, Medhikuchi, Pathsala, Dhumarkur, Bhawanipur, Kayakuchi and the Barpeta district.\nFrequent rains in monsoon season often make the Pahumara river flood in many places, such as paddy fields (underwater fields for growing rice) and roads in the Bahari sub-divison of the Barpeta district. During this time the river is quite dangerous. Sometimes the river floods when the Kurichhu hydroelectric plant in Bhutan opens its dam.\nAccording to local people, a type of boat race on the Pahumara river has been a tradition of the area for more than 100 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Barpeta_district","surface_form":"Barpeta district","offset":50},{"uri":"Assam","surface_form":"Assam","offset":70},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":79},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":154},{"uri":"Brahmaputra_River","surface_form":"Brahmaputra River","offset":171},{"uri":"Puthimari","surface_form":"Puthimari","offset":220},{"uri":"Medhikuchi","surface_form":"Medhikuchi","offset":231},{"uri":"Pathsala","surface_form":"Pathsala","offset":243},{"uri":"Dhumarkur","surface_form":"Dhumarkur","offset":253},{"uri":"Bhawanipur","surface_form":"Bhawanipur","offset":264},{"uri":"Kayakuchi","surface_form":"Kayakuchi","offset":276},{"uri":"Monsoon","surface_form":"monsoon","offset":330},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":375},{"uri":"Paddy_field","surface_form":"paddy fields","offset":405},{"uri":"Bahari","surface_form":"Bahari","offset":472},{"uri":"Hydroelectricity","surface_form":"hydroelectric","offset":608},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":648},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":690}]}
