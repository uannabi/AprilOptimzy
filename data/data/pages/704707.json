{"id":704707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehud_Medinata","text":"Yehud Medinata (Aramaic for the State of Judah), or simply Yehud, was part of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. It was within the satrapy of Eber-Nari.\nIt was roughly like the older kingdom of Judah but had less land. The area of Yehud Medinata is roughly the same as the previous Babylonian province of Yehud, which was created after the kingdom of Judah was invaded by the Neo-Babylonian Empire (c. 597).\nYehud Medinata continued to exist for two centuries, until Alexander the Great conquered it and made it part of his empire.\nHistory.\nExact times for Babylonian and Persian rule do not have complete agreement. Other dates are plausible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aramaic_language","surface_form":"Aramaic","offset":16},{"uri":"Achaemenid_Empire","surface_form":"Achaemenid Empire","offset":90},{"uri":"Satrap","surface_form":"satrapy","offset":127},{"uri":"Judah","surface_form":"kingdom of Judah","offset":179},{"uri":"Judah","surface_form":"kingdom of Judah","offset":336},{"uri":"Neo-Babylonian_Empire","surface_form":"Neo-Babylonian Empire","offset":372},{"uri":"Alexander_the_Great","surface_form":"Alexander the Great","offset":463}]}
