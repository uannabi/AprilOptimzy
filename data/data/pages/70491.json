{"id":70491,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_ProTour","text":"e=\"preserve\">The UCI ProTour is a series of bicycle road races organised by the world governing body the International Cycling Federation (\"Union Cycliste Internationale\" - the UCI)\nThe ProTour is the top grade of races for the top 20 cycling teams.\nThe ProTour includes one day races, time trials, and stage races. It started in 2005 and replaced the old world championship series which did not include stage races.\nAll of the ProTour races are in Europe, but the teams come from Europe and the United States. At the moment it is hard to move up from the Continental circuits to the ProTour, but in the future teams from Africa, Australia or Asia could take part in the ProTour.\nList of current UCI ProTour teams.\n2005\u00A0|\n2006\u00A0|\n2007\nRonde\u00A0van\u00A0Vlaanderen\u00A0|\nVuelta\u00A0al\u00A0Pa\u00EDs Vasco\u00A0|\nAmstel\u00A0Gold\u00A0Race\u00A0|\nLa\u00A0Fl\u00E8che\u00A0Wallonne\u00A0|\nTour\u00A0de\u00A0Romandie\u00A0|\nGiro\u00A0d'Italia\u00A0|\nVolta\u00A0a\u00A0Catalunya\u00A0|\nCrit\u00E9rium\u00A0du\u00A0Dauphin\u00E9\u00A0Lib\u00E9r\u00E9\u00A0|\nTour\u00A0de\u00A0Suisse\u00A0|\nEindhoven\u00A0TTT\u00A0|\nTour\u00A0de\u00A0France\u00A0|\nCl\u00E1sica\u00A0de\u00A0San\u00A0Sebasti\u00E1n\u00A0|\nDeutschland\u00A0Tour\u00A0|\nVattenfall\u00A0Cyclassics\u00A0|\nEneco\u00A0Tour\u00A0of\u00A0Benelux\u00A0|\nVuelta\u00A0a\u00A0Espa\u00F1a\u00A0|\nGP\u00A0Ouest-France\u00A0|\nTour\u00A0de\u00A0Pologne\u00A0|\nGiro\u00A0di\u00A0Lombardia","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UCI","surface_form":"UCI","offset":177},{"uri":"Time_trials","surface_form":"time trials","offset":286},{"uri":"Stage_races","surface_form":"stage races","offset":303},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":449},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":496},{"uri":"Continental_circuits","surface_form":"Continental circuits","offset":556},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":622},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":630},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":643},{"uri":"2005_UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"2005","offset":715},{"uri":"2006_UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"2006","offset":722},{"uri":"2007_UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"2007","offset":729},{"uri":"Ronde_van_Vlaanderen","surface_form":"Ronde\u00A0van\u00A0Vlaanderen","offset":734},{"uri":"Vuelta_al_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco","surface_form":"Vuelta\u00A0al\u00A0Pa\u00EDs Vasco","offset":757},{"uri":"Amstel_Gold_Race","surface_form":"Amstel\u00A0Gold\u00A0Race","offset":780},{"uri":"La_Fl%C3%A8che_Wallonne","surface_form":"La\u00A0Fl\u00E8che\u00A0Wallonne","offset":799},{"uri":"Tour_de_Romandie","surface_form":"Tour\u00A0de\u00A0Romandie","offset":820},{"uri":"Giro_d%27Italia","surface_form":"Giro\u00A0d'Italia","offset":839},{"uri":"Volta_a_Catalunya","surface_form":"Volta\u00A0a\u00A0Catalunya","offset":855},{"uri":"Crit%C3%A9rium_du_Dauphin%C3%A9_Lib%C3%A9r%C3%A9","surface_form":"Crit\u00E9rium\u00A0du\u00A0Dauphin\u00E9\u00A0Lib\u00E9r\u00E9","offset":875},{"uri":"Tour_de_Suisse","surface_form":"Tour\u00A0de\u00A0Suisse","offset":906},{"uri":"Eindhoven_Team_Time_Trial","surface_form":"Eindhoven\u00A0TTT","offset":923},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour\u00A0de\u00A0France","offset":939},{"uri":"Cl%C3%A1sica_de_San_Sebasti%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Cl\u00E1sica\u00A0de\u00A0San\u00A0Sebasti\u00E1n","offset":956},{"uri":"Deutschland_Tour","surface_form":"Deutschland\u00A0Tour","offset":983},{"uri":"Vattenfall_Cyclassics","surface_form":"Vattenfall\u00A0Cyclassics","offset":1002},{"uri":"Eneco_Tour_of_Benelux","surface_form":"Eneco\u00A0Tour\u00A0of\u00A0Benelux","offset":1026},{"uri":"Vuelta_a_Espa%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Vuelta\u00A0a\u00A0Espa\u00F1a","offset":1050},{"uri":"GP_Ouest-France","surface_form":"GP\u00A0Ouest-France","offset":1068},{"uri":"Tour_de_Pologne","surface_form":"Tour\u00A0de\u00A0Pologne","offset":1086},{"uri":"Giro_di_Lombardia","surface_form":"Giro\u00A0di\u00A0Lombardia","offset":1104}]}
