{"id":704917,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowding_out_(economics)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In economics, crowding out happens when the government starts buying or selling more stuff in the market. This affects other people and businesses--usually in a bad way.\nFor example, if the government buys more stuff, it may have to borrow more. By borrowing more there will be a higher interest rate (see supply and demand). This will make it harder for other companies and people to borrow. The government is said to \"crowd out\" the market.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":16},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":57},{"uri":"Market_economy","surface_form":"market","offset":111},{"uri":"Interest_rate","surface_form":"interest rate","offset":300},{"uri":"Supply_and_demand","surface_form":"supply and demand","offset":319}]}
