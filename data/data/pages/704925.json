{"id":704925,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomercantilism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Neomercantilism is a government policy that supports more exports, less imports, and more control over investment (capital movement). Also, the government has the power to make decisions involving money (currency). The goal is to increase foreign reserves, which gives the government more power over money.\nOrigin.\nThe idea comes from Keynesian economics. According to UNESCO, mercantilism is the belief that the state's wealth must be protected by the government. This makes the state's money a nationalistic concern.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
