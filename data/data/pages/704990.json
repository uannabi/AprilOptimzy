{"id":704990,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_society","text":"=\"preserve\">In an industrial society, people use technology to produce a lot of things (mass production). This leads to a large population with an organized division of labour. This happened to the Western world during the Industrial Revolution. This replaced farming or agrarian societies of the pre-modern age.\nThe US and many European nations are examples of industrial societies. China and India are also somewhat industrial but large parts of their populations still farm.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":49},{"uri":"Mass_production","surface_form":"mass production","offset":88},{"uri":"Population_growth","surface_form":"large population","offset":122},{"uri":"Division_of_labour","surface_form":"division of labour","offset":157},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"Western world","offset":198},{"uri":"Industrial_Revolution","surface_form":"Industrial Revolution","offset":223},{"uri":"Modern_history","surface_form":"pre-modern","offset":297},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":384},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":394}]}
