Today, they are usually made of heat-resistant borosilicate glass. There is at least one tubular section known as the \"neck\" with an opening at the tip. Two or three-necked flasks are made. Round bottom flasks come in many sizes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Laboratory_flask","surface_form":"flask","offset":70},{"uri":"Laboratory_glassware","surface_form":"laboratory glassware","offset":110},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemical","offset":157},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemical","offset":169},{"uri":"Borosilicate","surface_form":"borosilicate","offset":234}]}
