{"id":705048,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuna_matata","text":"Hakuna matata means \"no worries\" in Swahili, a language of East Africa. The phrase was used in the Disney movie \"The Lion King\" in a song of the same name.\nIn 2003 Disney trademarked the phrase in the US. In 2018, some people accused Disney or \"colonialism\" and \"robbery\" for stealing the phrase from East Africa. The phrase is popular in Kenya, one of the countries where it came from. But because of the trademark, Kenyans are not allowed to sell stuff to the US that use that phrase.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swahili_language","surface_form":"Swahili","offset":36},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":59},{"uri":"The_Walt_Disney_Company","surface_form":"Disney","offset":99},{"uri":"The_Lion_King","surface_form":"The Lion King","offset":113},{"uri":"Trademark","surface_form":"trademarked","offset":171},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"US","offset":201},{"uri":"Colonialism","surface_form":"colonialism","offset":245},{"uri":"Robbery","surface_form":"robbery","offset":263},{"uri":"Kenya","surface_form":"Kenya","offset":339}]}
