{"id":705054,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cosmogony is any theory of the origin of the universe.\nPhysics.\nIn astronomy, cosmogony is the study of the origin of things like the universe, the Solar System, or the Earth\u2013Moon system. The popular cosmological model for the birth of the universe is the Big Bang theory.\nIt is generally accepted that the universe began as a singularity, and when the singularity of the universe started to expand, the Big Bang occurred, which began the universe.\nPeople disagree on the origins of the singularity.\nIt may be like a black hole, which is a singularity sincegravity in a black hole becomes boundless.\nOthers like Stephen Hawking say \"time\" did not exist and was only born with the universe. Hence the universe does not have an origin story. Time did not exist before the creation of the universe.\nThere is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the Planck time). This is because we lack a testable theory of quantum gravity. Still, some researchers in string theory, M theory, and loop quantum cosmology have some ideas.\nMythology.\nThere are certain myths that also propose how the universe was created: for example creation myths in the Bible, the D\u00E0o D\u00E9 J\u012Bng, and other genesis stories. These usually involve\nThe Eridu Genesis, written on Sumerian tablets, is one of the oldest creation myths. The universe was created from a sea (Abzu). In Greek mythology, Zeus created the universe.\nIt is not the same as cosmology.\nCosmology studies the universe in general. You can still study the universe without thinking about its origin, which is what cosmonogy studies specifically.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":58},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":80},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":161},{"uri":"Physical_cosmology","surface_form":"cosmological","offset":213},{"uri":"Scientific_theory","surface_form":"model","offset":226},{"uri":"Universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":253},{"uri":"Big_Bang","surface_form":"Big Bang","offset":269},{"uri":"Singularity","surface_form":"singularity","offset":340},{"uri":"Gravitational_singularity","surface_form":"singularity","offset":500},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":530},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":570},{"uri":"Stephen_Hawking","surface_form":"Stephen Hawking","offset":625},{"uri":"Planck_time","surface_form":"Planck time","offset":924},{"uri":"Quantum_gravity","surface_form":"quantum gravity","offset":983},{"uri":"String_theory","surface_form":"string theory","offset":1027},{"uri":"M-theory","surface_form":"M theory","offset":1042},{"uri":"Creation_myth","surface_form":"creation myth","offset":1191},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":1213},{"uri":"D%C3%A0o_D%C3%A9_J%C4%ABng","surface_form":"D\u00E0o D\u00E9 J\u012Bng","offset":1224},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":1418},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":1435},{"uri":"Cosmology","surface_form":"Cosmology","offset":1495}]}
