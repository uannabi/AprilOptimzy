{"id":705065,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glauber_dynamics","text":"e=\"preserve\">In statistical physics, Glauber dynamics is a way to simulate the Ising model (a model of magnetism) on a computer. It is a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.\nThe algorithm.\nThis tries to approximate how the spins change over time. The fancy term is that it is part of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which roughly studies the time-dependent behavior of statistical mechanics.\nHistory.\nThe algorithm is named after Roy J. Glauber, Nobel Prize winner and a Harvard physicist who worked at Los Alamos.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistical_physics","surface_form":"statistical physics","offset":16},{"uri":"Simulation","surface_form":"simulate","offset":66},{"uri":"Ising_model","surface_form":"Ising model","offset":79},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":103},{"uri":"Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","surface_form":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo","offset":145},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":170},{"uri":"Nonequilibrium_statistical_mechanics","surface_form":"nonequilibrium statistical mechanics","offset":291},{"uri":"Roy_J._Glauber","surface_form":"Roy J.
