{"id":70512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Someone who is in right-wing politics is usually someone who supports social or economic conservatism. In other words, someone who is \"right-wing\" usually supports tradition and the way things are. People who are extremely right-wing are called \"reactionary\", and want to either return to the way things were before, such as neoreaction, or more often start as a reaction against left-wing ideas which are spreading in a country.\nThe right-wing supports tradition and authority. The right-wing in some countries, like the United States, may also usually be in support of social liberalism and a capitalist economy where the government has little influence. Usually the right-wing thinks of society as similar to a living thing, what is called \"organic society\". They believe that society's customs and traditions are a collection of things that we have learned from the past and are useful and should be maintained as much as possible.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Social","surface_form":"social","offset":83},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"economic","offset":93},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservatism","offset":102},{"uri":"Social_liberalism","surface_form":"social liberalism","offset":584},{"uri":"Custom","surface_form":"custom","offset":803},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":815}]}
