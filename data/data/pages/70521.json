{"id":70521,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XV","text":"Louis XV (15 February 1710 \u2013 10 May 1774) was a French king, who ruled from 1715 until his death. He is the great-grandson of Louis XIV whom he succeeded at age of five. He was called \"The Beloved\" (French: le Bien-Aim\u00E9). His failure to provide strong leadership and badly needed reforms contributed to the crisis that brought on the French Revolution.\nEarly life and reign.\nLouis was born at Versailles on 15 February 1710, the son of Louis, Dauphin of France and his mother Marie Ad\u00E9la\u00EFde of Savoy. Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans, Regent of France, governed as regent until Louis reached his legal majority in 1723. In 1725 the king married Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, daughter of Stanis\u0142aw I of Poland. The following year his former tutor, Andr\u00E9 Hercule de Fleury, became the chief minister. Fleury gave France a stable administration until his death 17 years later. Thereafter Louis himself was in nominal control, but he took only a sporadic interest in government and never followed any consistent policy at home or abroad. He was frequently influenced by his mistresses, the most powerful of whom was the marquise de Pompadour\nWars and death.\nFrance was involved in three wars during Louis's reign. As a result of the first, the War of the Polish Succession (1733-35), France gained the province of Lorraine. The second, the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48), which marked the beginning of a colonial struggle with Britain, was indecisive. In the last, the Seven Years' War (1756-63), France, crippled by corruption and mismanagement, lost most of its overseas possessions to the British. French foreign policy in this period was made chaotic by Louis's \u201Csecret diplomacy,\u201D as his agents in other countries sometimes pursued aims that were in conflict with those of his own ministers. The situation improved somewhat in the 1760s, when a new minister, the duc de Choiseul, restored some order to the government and tried to repair the damage done by the Seven Years' War. In the last years of his reign, Louis cooperated with his chancellor, Ren\u00E9 de Maupeou, in an effort to reform the country's inequitable and inefficient system of taxation. In 1771 the parlements, or sovereign courts, which had opposed reform, were reorganized and stripped of their power to obstruct royal decrees. Measures were then implemented to tax the previously exempt nobility and clergy, but these were reversed after the king's death at Versailles on 10 May 1774. Louis XV died of smallpox as a defeated and unpopular king. He was succeeded by his grandson, Louis XVI, who was later guillotined during the French Revolution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":48},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":55},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":126},{"uri":"Crisis","surface_form":"crisis","offset":307},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":334},{"uri":"Louis%2C_Dauphin_of_France%2C_Duke_of_Burgundy","surface_form":"Louis, Dauphin of France","offset":436},{"uri":"Marie_Ad%C3%A9la%C3%AFde_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Marie Ad\u00E9la\u00EFde of Savoy","offset":476},{"uri":"Philippe%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Regent_of_France","surface_form":"Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans, Regent of France","offset":501},{"uri":"Versailles","surface_form":"Versailles","offset":2418},{"uri":"Smallpox","surface_form":"smallpox","offset":2462},{"uri":"Louis_XVI","surface_form":"Louis XVI","offset":2539},{"uri":"Guillotine","surface_form":"guillotine","offset":2564}]}
