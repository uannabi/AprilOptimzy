He was the writer of \"Be Here Now\", the bestseller book of 1971.\nIn the 1960s, professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert collaborated on a book titled \"The Psychedelic Experience\", which adapted portions of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" as a guide for use in LSD experiences. They hoped to give users of LSD a simulation of death and rebirth, to \"liberate\" them from past problems or mistakes in their lives.\nDass died on December 22, 2019 in Maui, Hawaii at the age of 88.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"April_6","surface_form":"April 6","offset":20},{"uri":"1931","surface_form":"1931","offset":29},{"uri":"December_22","surface_form":"December 22","offset":36},{"uri":"2019","surface_form":"2019","offset":49},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spiritual","offset":91},{"uri":"Be_Here_Now","surface_form":"Be Here Now","offset":132},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":182},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":189},{"uri":"Timothy_Leary","surface_form":"Timothy Leary","offset":200},{"uri":"Ralph_Metzner","surface_form":"Ralph Metzner","offset":215},{"uri":"Psychedelic","surface_form":"Psychedelic","offset":283},{"uri":"Experience","surface_form":"Experience","offset":295},{"uri":"Tibetan_Book_of_the_Dead","surface_form":"Tibetan Book of the Dead","offset":339},{"uri":"Lysergic_acid_diethylamide","surface_form":"LSD","offset":387},{"uri":"Simulation","surface_form":"simulation","offset":438},{"uri":"Maui","surface_form":"Maui","offset":571},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":577}]}
