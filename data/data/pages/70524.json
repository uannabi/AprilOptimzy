{"id":70524,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic","text":"=\"preserve\">The word psychedelic is a word invented in the 20th century by joining the Greek words for \"mind,\" \u03C8\u03C5\u03C7\u03AE (psyche), and \"manifest,\" \u03B4\u03AE\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2 (delos).\nA person in a \"psychedelic state\" is supposed to be able to feel new ways of looking at his mind that were unknown to him before. This can be caused by taking psychedelic drugs, like LSD. In medicine, the new feelings a patient has when he is in psychedelic state are called hallucinations and synesthesia; these are also seen in patients with psychosis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":59},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":328},{"uri":"LSD","surface_form":"LSD","offset":340},{"uri":"Hallucination","surface_form":"hallucination","offset":432},{"uri":"Synesthesia","surface_form":"synesthesia","offset":451},{"uri":"Psychosis","surface_form":"psychosis","offset":501}]}
