Between 1271\u20131633, the Yuan dynasty (through Guo Shoujing and others) and the Ming dynasty improved it and built parts to direct water to Beijing.\nThe total length is. Its greatest height is 42\u00A0m (138\u00A0ft) near the Shandong mountains.\nSong Dynasty (960\u20131279) engineer Qiao Weiyue invented the pound lock in the 10th century. This allowed ships to travel higher and lower through the canal.\nThe canal amazed many people throughout history including Japanese monk Ennin (794\u2013864), Persian historian Rashid al-Din (1247\u20131318), Korean official Choe Bu (1454\u20131504), and Italian missionary Matteo Ricci (1552\u20131610).\nHistorically, flooding of the Yellow River threatened to break the canal. During wartime the canal was even used as a weapon: the dikes of the Yellow River were sometimes broken to flood the enemy troops. But this caused disasters and hurt the economy.\nThe Canal has greatly improved China's economy and increased trade between the north and south. It is still used heavily to this day.\nIt is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canal","surface_form":"canal","offset":81},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":102},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":135},{"uri":"Tianjin","surface_form":"Tianjin","offset":159},{"uri":"Hebei","surface_form":"Hebei","offset":168},{"uri":"Shandong","surface_form":"Shandong","offset":175},{"uri":"Jiangsu","surface_form":"Jiangsu","offset":185},{"uri":"Zhejiang","surface_form":"Zhejiang","offset":197},{"uri":"Hangzhou","surface_form":"Hangzhou","offset":219},{"uri":"Yellow_River","surface_form":"Yellow River","offset":273},{"uri":"Yangzi","surface_form":"Yangzi","offset":294},{"uri":"Sui_Dynasty","surface_form":"Sui dynasty","offset":374},{"uri":"Yuan_dynasty","surface_form":"Yuan dynasty","offset":446},{"uri":"Guo_Shoujing","surface_form":"Guo Shoujing","offset":468},{"uri":"Ming_dynasty","surface_form":"Ming dynasty","offset":501},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":561},{"uri":"Shandong","surface_form":"Shandong","offset":637},{"uri":"Song_Dynasty","surface_form":"Song Dynasty","offset":657},{"uri":"Qiao_Weiyue","surface_form":"Qiao Weiyue","offset":690},{"uri":"Lock_(water_transport)","surface_form":"pound lock","offset":715},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":870},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Persian","offset":901},{"uri":"Rashid_al-Din","surface_form":"Rashid al-Din","offset":919},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korean","offset":946},{"uri":"Choe_Bu","surface_form":"Choe Bu","offset":962},{"uri":"Yellow_River","surface_form":"Yellow River","offset":1062},{"uri":"Dikes","surface_form":"dikes","offset":1162},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"UNESCO World Heritage Site","offset":1427}]}
