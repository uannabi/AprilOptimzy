{"id":705274,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_as_a_service","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is transportation that you can buy but do not have to own.\nFor example, you can pay an Uber car to pick you up, but you do not own that car.\nOr you can pay for a city bike to travel around the city, but you do not own the bike.\nIn each case, you pay for the transportation.\nPublic buses, taxis, subways, high-speed rail, and airplanes are already forms of MaaS.\nMaaS is already becoming popular around the world from the US, Europe, Japan, Korea, to China.\nShort-term impact.\nMaaS may decrease how many people own cars. This is already the case in China, where more than half of the population do not have cars--they just do not need it.\nSelf driving cars (AV).\nUber, Tesla, General Motors, Waymo, Apple, and Local Motors are building self-driving vehicles (or autonomous vehicles, AVs).\nSelf-driving cars could take people where they wanted to go at a lower cost than a taxi or ridesharer. It could help benefit the environment, make transportation faster, and even improve healthcare.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uber","surface_form":"Uber","offset":129},{"uri":"High-speed_rail","surface_form":"high-speed rail","offset":346},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"US","offset":463},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":467},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":475},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Korea","offset":482},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":492},{"uri":"Uber","surface_form":"Uber","offset":704},{"uri":"Tesla%2C_Inc.","surface_form":"Tesla","offset":710},{"uri":"General_Motors","surface_form":"General Motors","offset":717},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple","offset":740},{"uri":"Driverless_car","surface_form":"self-driving vehicles","offset":777}]}
