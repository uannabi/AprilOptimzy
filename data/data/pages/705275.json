{"id":705275,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars","text":"ce=\"preserve\">The Khazars were a semi-nomadic Turkic people. They formed an empire called Khazaria in Russia from the 6th to 10th century CE. They came from the Western Turkic Khaganate of the Eurasian steppe, after it was conquered by Tang China.\nKhazaria was an international trading center. It was an important place on the Silk Road that linked China, the Middle East, and the Kievan Rus'. For three centuries (c. 650\u2013965) the Khazars conquered the area from the Volga-Don steppes to Crimea and the Caucasus.\nKhazaria was between the Byzantine Empire, the steppe nomads, and the Umayyad Caliphate. It helped Byzantine defend itself from the Sasanian Persian empire. The alliance ended around 900. Between 965 and 969, the Kievan Rus replaced Khazaria.\nTengrism may have been the main religion, as it was for the Huns and Turkic peoples. Abrahamic religions were also popular. The ruling class may have converted to Judaism in the 8th century.\nSome people think that the Cossacks, Muslim Kumyks, Kazakhs, and some Jews, like the Ashkenazi Jews, descended from the Khazars. Some disagree.\nName.\nKhazar or \"Xazar\" may have come from *Qasar. The Turkic root \"qaz-\" means \"to ramble, to roam\" (used in Qazaqsa or Kazakh). It is similar to the Common Turkic \"kez-\".\nOthers say it is from \"qas-\" (\"tyrannize, oppress, terrorize\") because it is similar to the Uyghur name Qasar.\nOthers think it is a person or tribe's name. For example the Chinese name Kesa for \"Khazars\" may be one of the tribal names of the Uy\u011Fur Toquz O\u011Fuz (of the Gokturks), namely the \"G\u00E9s\u00E0\". But others say Kesa was not a tribal name but the name of the chief of the \u601D\u7ED3 \"Sijie\" tribe of the Toquz O\u011Fuz. Also in Middle Chinese the name \"Khazars\" always comes before the word \"T\u016Bju\u00E9\" (\"T\u016Bju\u00E9 K\u011Bs\u00E0 b\u00F9\": \u7A81\u53A5\u53EF\u85A9\u90E8; \"T\u016Bju\u00E9 H\u00E9s\u00E0\": \u7A81\u53A5\u66F7\u85A9).\nKhazar language is extinct. But modern Turkic languages still refer to the Caspian Sea as the \"Khazar Sea\".\nLanguage.\nNo known records of the Khazar language survive. The state was polyglot (spoke multiple languages) and polyethnic. The ruling elite probably spoke an eastern dialect of Shaz Turkic. The ordinary people may have spoken Lir Turkic, such as O\u011Furic, Bul\u011Faric, Chuvash, and Hunnish. The Persian historian al-I\u1E63\u1E6Dakhr\u012B said that the Khazar language was different from any other known language.\nAfter the Khazars became Jewish they may have written in the Hebrew alphabet. Though they spoke a T\u00FCrkic language, they may have also spoke Hebrew.\nWhere are they from?\nThey appear to have came from Mongolia or northern China after the Xi\u014Dngn\u00FA (Huns) were defeated by Han dynasty of China (Han\u2013Xiongnu war). The tribes probably had Iranian, proto-Mongolic, Uralic, and Palaeo-Siberian people.\nThe Turkic tribes may have conquered the Western Eurasian steppe as early as 463.\nIn 552, they conquered the Rouran Khaganate and moved westwards, taking more people from Sogdia.\nThe ruling family may have came from the \u0100sh\u01D0n\u00E0 (\u963F\u53F2\u90A3) clan of the West T\u00FCrkic tribes. The Chinese and Arabic records are almost identical, indicating strong support for this theory. The leader may have been Y\u01D0p\u00EDsh\u00E8ku\u00EC (\u4E59\u6BD7\u5C04\u5331). He died around 651. Moving west, the Khazars reached Akatziroi, one of the important friends of Byzantium fighting Attila's army.\nHow did it begin?\nKhazaria began after 630. It came from the G\u00F6kt\u00FCrk Qa\u011Fanate, after it was crushed by Tang China between 630\u2013650.\nG\u00F6kt\u00FCrk armies conquered Volga by 549. The \u0100sh\u01D0n\u00E0 clan whose tribal name was 'T\u00FCrk' (\"the strong one\") arrived in 552. They overthrew the Rourans and created the G\u00F6kt\u00FCrk Qa\u011Fanate.\nThe Chinese Tang Dynasty defeated the Turkic Qa\u011Fanate and established the Anxi protectorate (Tang dynasty in Inner Asia). The Khaganate split into many tribes. Some tribes went west to the Sea of Azov area. Ashina and the Khazars went further west.\nIn 657, General S\u016B D\u00ECngf\u0101ng (\u8607\u5B9A\u65B9) dominated the Turks and Central Asia. They imposed Chinese overlordship to the east of those Turkic tribes. In 659 the Chinese defeated the remaining tribes. The Khazars did not dare return.\nInstead the Khazars defeated the Bulgars further west.\nAnd so the Khazars Qaganate was born, from the ruins of a nomadic empire destroyed by the Tang armies to the east. It became the westernmost successor state of the Gokturks.\nThe Khazars conquered the lower Volga region and the area between the Danube and the Dniepr. In 670, they also conquered the Ono\u011Fur-Bul\u011Far union and made the Onogur-Bulgar language the official language of the empire (lingua franca).\nThe empire is sometimes called a 'steppe Atlantis' (\"stepnaja Atlantida,\" \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043F\u043D\u0430\u044F \u0410\u0442\u043B\u0430\u043D\u0442\u0438\u0434\u0430).\nHistorians often call this period the Pax Khazarica. The state became an international center of trade.\nIbn al-Bal\u1E2B\u00EE wrote in \"F\u00E2rsn\u00E2ma\" (c. 1100) that the Sasanian Shah (ruler), \u1E2Ausraw 1, An\u00FBs\u00EErv\u00E2n, said there were three kings who had as much power as he did: the King of China, the King of Byzantium, and the king of the Khazars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nomadic_people","surface_form":"nomadic","offset":38},{"uri":"Turkic_peoples","surface_form":"Turkic people","offset":46},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":102},{"uri":"Western_Turkic_Khaganate","surface_form":"Western Turkic Khaganate","offset":161},{"uri":"Eurasian_steppe","surface_form":"Eurasian steppe","offset":193},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang","offset":236},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":241},{"uri":"Silk_Road","surface_form":"Silk Road","offset":327},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"China","offset":349},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":360},{"uri":"Kievan_Rus%27","surface_form":"Kievan Rus'","offset":381},{"uri":"Volga-Don_steppes","surface_form":"Volga-Don steppes","offset":467},{"uri":"Crimea","surface_form":"Crimea","offset":488},{"uri":"Caucasus","surface_form":"Caucasus","offset":503},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Empire","offset":538},{"uri":"Umayyad_Caliphate","surface_form":"Umayyad Caliphate","offset":583},{"uri":"Sassanid_Empire","surface_form":"Sasanian Persian empire","offset":645},{"uri":"Kievan_Rus%27","surface_form":"Kievan Rus","offset":726},{"uri":"Tengrism","surface_form":"Tengrism","offset":756},{"uri":"Huns","surface_form":"Huns","offset":816},{"uri":"Turkic_peoples","surface_form":"Turkic peoples","offset":825},{"uri":"Abrahamic_religion","surface_form":"Abrahamic religions","offset":841},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":919},{"uri":"Cossacks","surface_form":"Cossacks","offset":974},{"uri":"Kazakhs","surface_form":"Kazakhs","offset":999},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jews","offset":1017},{"uri":"Ashkenazi_Jews","surface_form":"Ashkenazi Jews","offset":1032},{"uri":"Root_(linguistics)","surface_form":"root","offset":1153},{"uri":"Qazaqsa","surface_form":"Qazaqsa","offset":1201},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Common Turkic","offset":1242},{"uri":"Gokturks","surface_form":"Gokturks","offset":1531},{"uri":"Middle_Chinese","surface_form":"Middle Chinese","offset":1680},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Turkic languages","offset":1836},{"uri":"Caspian_Sea","surface_form":"Caspian Sea","offset":1872},{"uri":"Multilingualism","surface_form":"polyglot","offset":1978},{"uri":"Chuvash_language","surface_form":"Chuvash","offset":2171},{"uri":"Language_isolate","surface_form":"different from any other known language","offset":2261},{"uri":"Hebrew_script","surface_form":"Hebrew alphabet","offset":2363},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":2442},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":2501},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":2522},{"uri":"Xiongnu","surface_form":"Xi\u014Dngn\u00FA","offset":2538},{"uri":"Huns","surface_form":"Huns","offset":2547},{"uri":"Han_dynasty","surface_form":"Han dynasty","offset":2570},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":2585},{"uri":"Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu_war","surface_form":"Han\u2013Xiongnu war","offset":2592},{"uri":"Iranians","surface_form":"Iranian","offset":2634},{"uri":"Mongols","surface_form":"proto-Mongolic","offset":2643},{"uri":"Uralic_languages","surface_form":"Uralic","offset":2659},{"uri":"Eurasian_steppe","surface_form":"Eurasian steppe","offset":2744},{"uri":"Rouran_Khaganate","surface_form":"Rouran Khaganate","offset":2804},{"uri":"Sogdia","surface_form":"Sogdia","offset":2866},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":2964},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":2976},{"uri":"Attila_the_Hun","surface_form":"Attila","offset":3215},{"uri":"Gokturks","surface_form":"G\u00F6kt\u00FCrk Qa\u011Fanate","offset":3291},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang","offset":3333},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":3338},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang Dynasty","offset":3553},{"uri":"Anxi_protectorate","surface_form":"Anxi protectorate","offset":3615},{"uri":"Sea_of_Azov","surface_form":"Sea of Azov","offset":3730},{"uri":"Successor_state","surface_form":"successor state","offset":4211},{"uri":"Danube","surface_form":"Danube","offset":4314},{"uri":"Dnieper","surface_form":"Dniepr","offset":4329},{"uri":"Lingua_franca","surface_form":"lingua franca","offset":4462},{"uri":"Pax_Khazarica","surface_form":"Pax Khazarica","offset":4610},{"uri":"Ibn_al-Bal%E1%B8%AB%C3%AE","surface_form":"Ibn al-Bal\u1E2B\u00EE","offset":4676},{"uri":"Sassanid_Empire","surface_form":"Sasanian","offset":4728},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":4845}]}
