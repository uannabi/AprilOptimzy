{"id":705425,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Republic of China (ROC) was a country that existed between 1912 and 1949. It is now the People's Republic of China. It was created in January 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. The Republic's first president was Sun Yat-sen. Sun's party, the Kuomintang (KMT) won the parliamentary election in December 1912.\nBut Sun soon gave the position to Yuan Shikai, the leader of the Beiyang Army. The Beiyang Army also controlled the Beiyang government (which controlled Mongolia).\nBetween late 1915 and early 1916, Yuan Shikai called himself the Emperor of China. But people did not like it (National protection war).\nAfter Yuan died death in 1916, the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty. Various groups in the Beiyang Army claimed independence and fought with each other during the Warlord Era.\nIn 1921, the KMT created a rival government in Canton, supported by the Communist Party of China (CPC).\nNorth China was overtaxed and had too many fighting warlords. So its economy died between 1927 and 1928.\nGeneral Jiang Jieshi became the KMT leader after Sun's death. Jiang started the Northern Expedition in 1926 and overthrew the Beiyang government in 1928. In April 1927, Jiang created a nationalist government in Nanjing and massacred Communists in Shanghai. This forced the CPC into armed rebellion, starting the Chinese Civil War.\nChina experienced industrialization and modernization but suffered conflicts between the Nationalist government in Nanking, the CPC, warlords, and the Empire of Japan.\nEventually the Chinese unified to fight against their common enemy: the Japanese. In 1937 the Imperial Japanese Army invaded China in 1937. The Second Sino-Japanese War began.\nIn 1945 Japan surrendered at the end of World War II.\nIn 1946, the Chinese Civil War between the KMT and CPC restarted.\nIn 1949, the CPC defeated the KMT and started the People's Republic of China (PRC).\nJiang Jieshi and the KMT fled to Taiwan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":105},{"uri":"Xinhai_Revolution","surface_form":"Xinhai Revolution","offset":174},{"uri":"Qing_dynasty","surface_form":"Qing dynasty","offset":213},{"uri":"Sun_Yat-sen","surface_form":"Sun Yat-sen","offset":262},{"uri":"Kuomintang","surface_form":"Kuomintang","offset":292},{"uri":"National_protection_war","surface_form":"National protection war","offset":633},{"uri":"Guangzhou","surface_form":"Canton","offset":932},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"Communist Party of China","offset":957},{"uri":"Chiang_Kai-shek","surface_form":"Jiang Jieshi","offset":1102},{"uri":"Nanjing","surface_form":"Nanjing","offset":1305},{"uri":"Chinese_Civil_War","surface_form":"Chinese Civil War","offset":1406},{"uri":"Industrialization","surface_form":"industrialization","offset":1443},{"uri":"Empire_of_Japan","surface_form":"Empire of Japan","offset":1576},{"uri":"Imperial_Japanese_Army","surface_form":"Imperial Japanese Army","offset":1687},{"uri":"Second_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"Second Sino-Japanese War","offset":1737},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1809},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"People's Republic of China","offset":1939},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":2006}]}
