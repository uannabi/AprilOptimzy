{"id":705456,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABMiller","text":"SABMiller plc was a multinational brewing and beverage company headquartered in London, England. It is the world's second-largest brewer measured by revenues (after the Belgian-Brazilian-American Anheuser-Busch InBev) and is also a major bottler of Coca-Cola. Its brands include Fosters, Grolsch, Miller, Peroni and Pilsner Urquell. It has operations in 80 countries world-wide and in 2009 sold around 21 billion litres of beverages.\nSABMiller's origins date back to the foundation of South African Breweries in 1895 as to serve a growing market of miners and prospectors in and around Johannesburg. Two years later, it became the first industrial company to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. From the early 1990s onwards, the company increasingly expanded internationally, making several acquisitions in both emerging and developed markets. In 1999, it formed a new UK-based holding company, SAB plc, and moved its primary listing to London. In May 2002, SAB plc acquired Miller Brewing, forming SABMiller plc.\nSABMiller has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a market capitalisation of approximately \u00A342\u00A0billion as of 24 October 2015, the 6th-largest of any company with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\nIn October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to acquire SABMiller for \u00A369 billion ($104 billion).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Multinational_corporation","surface_form":"multinational","offset":20},{"uri":"Brewing","surface_form":"brewing","offset":34},{"uri":"Beverage","surface_form":"beverage","offset":46},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":55},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":80},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":88},{"uri":"Anheuser-Busch_InBev","surface_form":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","offset":196},{"uri":"Coca-Cola","surface_form":"Coca-Cola","offset":249},{"uri":"Foster%27s_Lager","surface_form":"Fosters","offset":279},{"uri":"Grolsch_Brewery","surface_form":"Grolsch","offset":288},{"uri":"Miller_Brewing_Company","surface_form":"Miller","offset":297},{"uri":"Peroni_Brewery","surface_form":"Peroni","offset":305},{"uri":"Pilsner_Urquell","surface_form":"Pilsner Urquell","offset":316},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"litre","offset":413},{"uri":"South_African_Breweries","surface_form":"South African Breweries","offset":485},{"uri":"Miner","surface_form":"miner","offset":549},{"uri":"Prospecting","surface_form":"prospectors","offset":560},{"uri":"Johannesburg","surface_form":"Johannesburg","offset":586},{"uri":"Johannesburg_Stock_Exchange","surface_form":"Johannesburg Stock Exchange","offset":671},{"uri":"Miller_Brewing","surface_form":"Miller Brewing","offset":980},{"uri":"London_Stock_Exchange","surface_form":"London Stock Exchange","offset":1058},{"uri":"FTSE_100_Index","surface_form":"FTSE 100 Index","offset":1108},{"uri":"Market_capitalisation","surface_form":"market capitalisation","offset":1133},{"uri":"Anheuser-Busch_InBev","surface_form":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","offset":1371}]}
