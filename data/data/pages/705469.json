{"id":705469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee","text":"e=\"preserve\">Video assistant referee (VAR) is a system that helps referees to decide better about players fouls, if a goal was valid, red card decisions, etc. in soccer matches. When the referee is going to review a play on the field at the VAR box, they outline a square with their hands, as if showing the outline of a TV screen. It was used for the first time in the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. It was used for the first time for international matches in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. The first time VAR was used in the FIFA World Cup was in the 2018 World Cup.\nIn March 2018, the VAR was permanentely written into the Laws of the Game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).\nThe referee can review the play on the field by going to the VAR box, listen to the VAR's recommendation, or completely ignore the VAR advice. The referee can only review the play on the field with recommendation of the VAR to prevent the referee from relying on it too much.\nCriticism.\nThe VAR system has been criticised by many people, mostly because of how much time is used up in reviews, overly relying on it, and causing confusion. Manager Mauricio Pochettino said \"it made everyone confused\". He also said that he felt sorry for the fans and for the referee after an FA Cup match.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Referee","surface_form":"referee","offset":66},{"uri":"Soccer","surface_form":"soccer","offset":162},{"uri":"TV","surface_form":"TV","offset":321},{"uri":"2016_FIFA_Club_World_Cup","surface_form":"2016 FIFA Club World Cup","offset":370},{"uri":"2017_FIFA_Confederations_Cup","surface_form":"2017 FIFA Confederations Cup","offset":460},{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","offset":525},{"uri":"2018_FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"2018 World Cup","offset":551},{"uri":"Laws_of_the_Game","surface_form":"Laws of the Game","offset":624},{"uri":"International_Football_Association_Board","surface_form":"International Football Association Board","offset":648},{"uri":"Mauricio_Pochettino","surface_form":"Mauricio Pochettino","offset":1143},{"uri":"FA_Cup","surface_form":"FA Cup","offset":1271}]}
