{"id":705591,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis","text":"In ancient Greek religion, Nemesis (Ancient Greek: \u039D\u03AD\u03BC\u03B5\u03C3\u03B9\u03C2), is the goddess who takes vengence against those who show hubris (arrogance before the gods).\nDivine retribution is a major theme in the Hellenic world view. It is the unifying theme of the tragedies of Sophocles and many other literary works.\nShe carried a measuring rod (a tally stick), a bridle, scales, a sword, and a scourge (whip), and she rides in a chariot drawn by griffins.\nNemesis often is seen with another goddess named Aidos. Aidos is the goddess of shame. She is similar to Nemesis.\nIn works of fiction the hero's nemesis is usually the villain and the hardest antagonist for the hero to defeat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":3},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":36},{"uri":"Hubris","surface_form":"hubris","offset":118},{"uri":"Hellenistic_period","surface_form":"Hellenic","offset":197},{"uri":"Sophocles","surface_form":"Sophocles","offset":263},{"uri":"Bridle","surface_form":"bridle","offset":351},{"uri":"Sword","surface_form":"sword","offset":369},{"uri":"Scourge","surface_form":"scourge","offset":382},{"uri":"Chariot","surface_form":"chariot","offset":417},{"uri":"Griffin","surface_form":"griffins","offset":434},{"uri":"Aidos","surface_form":"Aidos","offset":493},{"uri":"Shame","surface_form":"shame","offset":524},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":570},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":582},{"uri":"Villain","surface_form":"villain","offset":612},{"uri":"Antagonist","surface_form":"antagonist","offset":636},{"uri":"Hero","surface_form":"hero","offset":655}]}
