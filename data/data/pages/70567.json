{"id":70567,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_South_Australia","text":"Wind power in South Australia is a big energy source for the state and South Australia is well suited to wind farms as it is close to the Roaring forties winds.\nAs of June 2014, South Australia has 16 wind farms, with an installed capacity of 1,473 megawatts (MW). Wind power represented 27% of the state's energy production.\nWind farms do not emit greenhouse gases in the generation of electricity, and so wind power is considered a highly desirable form of renewable energy which assists in the reduction of the State\u2019s reliance on coal and gas fired electricity generation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":71},{"uri":"Wind_farm","surface_form":"wind farm","offset":105},{"uri":"Roaring_forties","surface_form":"Roaring forties","offset":138},{"uri":"Megawatt","surface_form":"megawatt","offset":249},{"uri":"Greenhouse_gas","surface_form":"greenhouse gas","offset":349},{"uri":"Renewable_energy","surface_form":"renewable energy","offset":459},{"uri":"Electricity_generation","surface_form":"electricity generation","offset":553}]}
