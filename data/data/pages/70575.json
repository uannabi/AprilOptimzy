{"id":70575,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Channel_Pro_Cycling_Team","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team was a professional racing team.\nThe US Postal Service stopped sponsoring their team in 2004. The Discovery Channel took over sponsorship in June 2004 in time for the new UCI ProTour\nOn February 10 2007 Discovery Channel decided not renew its sponsorship of the team at the end of the 2007 season. The decision to end its sponsorship is believed to be related to the sacking of Discovery Networks president Billy Campbell by David Zaslav, the new president of Discovery Communications the same day.\nOn 10 August 2007 Tailwind Sports, who are the team's licence holders, said the team would stop racing at the end of the year<. They could not find a new sponsor and blamed bad publicity about doping in the 2007 Tour de France.\nMembers.\nThe most famous member of the Discovery Channel team was Lance Armstrong who won seven Tours de France before he retired in 2005.\nCurrent members of the team, such as 2007 Tour de France winner Alberto Contador, 3rd placed Levi Leipheimer and George Hincapie all had to find new teams. Hincapie joined Team T-Mobile. Many think Contador may have trouble finding a new team because of rumours about being involved in the very big Operation Puerto doping scandal.\n2007 squad.\nAs of April 30, 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"UCI ProTour","offset":222},{"uri":"February_10","surface_form":"February 10","offset":237},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":249},{"uri":"Termination_of_employment","surface_form":"sacking","offset":418},{"uri":"Discovery_Networks","surface_form":"Discovery Networks","offset":429},{"uri":"Billy_Campbell","surface_form":"Billy Campbell","offset":458},{"uri":"Discovery_Communications","surface_form":"Discovery Communications","offset":511},{"uri":"10_August","surface_form":"10 August","offset":553},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":563},{"uri":"UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"licence","offset":604},{"uri":"Doping_in_sport","surface_form":"doping","offset":743},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":762},{"uri":"Lance_Armstrong","surface_form":"Lance Armstrong","offset":844},{"uri":"Alberto_Contador","surface_form":"Alberto Contador","offset":981},{"uri":"Levi_Leipheimer","surface_form":"Levi Leipheimer","offset":1010},{"uri":"George_Hincapie","surface_form":"George Hincapie","offset":1030},{"uri":"Team_T-Mobile","surface_form":"Team T-Mobile","offset":1089},{"uri":"Operacion_Puerto","surface_form":"Operation Puerto","offset":1216},{"uri":"Doping_in_sport","surface_form":"doping","offset":1233},{"uri":"April_30","surface_form":"April 30","offset":1267},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":1277}]}
