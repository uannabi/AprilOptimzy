{"id":705761,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouran","text":"The Rouran () ruled northern China during the Sixteen Kingdoms period.\nThey were either proto-Mongols or Turkic. They spoke the Ruanruan language, an Altaic or Sino\u2013Tibetan language.\nThey descended from the Xianbei. The Rouran are the first to use the words \"khan\" or \"khagan\". The Rouran Khaganate existed between the 4-6 centuries. They were then overthrown by the Gokturks. This led to the rise of the Turkic peoples.\nThe Rouran may have fled west after that and become part of the Pannonian Avars. The G\u00F6kt\u00FCrks chased after these \"Avars\" into the Byzantine Empire.\nWhere are they from?\nThe Rouran were nomads. They lived in the eastern Eurasian Steppe (Mongolia and northeast China). They overthrew the Xianbei. Most Xianbei moved south and lived in Northern China. Kwok Kin Poon argues the Rouran descended from the Donghu Xianbei.\nHistory.\nThe founder of the Rouran Khaganate was Yujiulu Shelun. He descended from slaves of the Xianbei. The Xianbei used the word rouran to mean \"wriggling worms\".\nAfter the Xianbei moved south in the 3rd century, the Rouran took over and conquered a lot of land.\nIn 402 Shelun unified all of the Rouran. They defeated the neighboring Tiele and expanded to the Silk Roads. They then conquered and vassalized the Hephthalites (of Central Asia) until 5th century.\nThe Hepthalites then moved towards India and replaced the Yuezhi in Bactria. The Hephtalites borrowed much culture and language from the Rouran: including the word \"Khan\".\nIn 429, Northern Wei (where the Xianbei settled) attacked the Rouran and killed many.\nIn 434, the Rouran made a heqin with Northern Wei.\nBetween 440-460, the Northern Wei attacked and defeated the Rouran several times.\nThe Rouran made a heqin with the Han-Chinese ruler Gao Huan of Eastern Wei.\nIn 508, the Tiele defeated the Rouran.\nIn 516, the Rouran defeated the Tiele.\nOverthrow by Gokturks.\nIn 551, Bumin of the Ashina G\u00F6kt\u00FCrks () defeated the Tiele revolt for the Rouran. In return Bumin asked for a Rouran princess (heqin). Rouran refused, so Bumin declared independence.\nBumin made a heqin with the Western Wei (descend from Northern Wei). Bumin then attacked the Rouran in 552, killing Yujiul\u00FC Anagui. Bumin then conquered Otuken.\nHe declared himself Illig Khagan and started the Turkic Khaganate. He died soon Bumin but his son Issik Qaghan succeeded him. Issik continued attacking the Rouran but died a year later in 553. His brother Muqan Qaghan finished the job and annihilated the Rouran in 555.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":29},{"uri":"Sixteen_Kingdoms","surface_form":"Sixteen Kingdoms","offset":46},{"uri":"Mongol_people","surface_form":"Mongols","offset":94},{"uri":"Turkic_peoples","surface_form":"Turkic","offset":105},{"uri":"Ruanruan","surface_form":"Ruanruan","offset":128},{"uri":"Altaic_languages","surface_form":"Altaic","offset":150},{"uri":"Han%E2%80%93Tibetan_languages","surface_form":"Sino\u2013Tibetan language","offset":160},{"uri":"Xianbei","surface_form":"Xianbei","offset":207},{"uri":"Turkic_peoples","surface_form":"Turkic peoples","offset":405},{"uri":"Eurasian_Avars","surface_form":"Pannonian Avars","offset":485},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Empire","offset":551},{"uri":"Nomadic_people","surface_form":"nomads","offset":606},{"uri":"Eurasian_Steppe","surface_form":"Eurasian Steppe","offset":640},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":657},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":680},{"uri":"Silk_Road","surface_form":"Silk Roads","offset":1200},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":1268},{"uri":"Bactria","surface_form":"Bactria","offset":1369},{"uri":"Khan_(title)","surface_form":"Khan","offset":1466},{"uri":"Heqin","surface_form":"heqin","offset":1585},{"uri":"Heqin","surface_form":"heqin","offset":1710},{"uri":"Han_Chinese","surface_form":"Han","offset":1725},{"uri":"Eastern_Wei","surface_form":"Eastern Wei","offset":1755},{"uri":"Tiele","surface_form":"Tiele","offset":1780},{"uri":"Khan_(title)","surface_form":"Khagan","offset":2239},{"uri":"Turkic_Khaganate","surface_form":"Turkic Khaganate","offset":2262}]}
