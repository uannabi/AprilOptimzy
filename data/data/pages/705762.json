{"id":705762,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Steppe","text":"The Eurasian Steppe (or Ya'ou Steppe; \u4E9A\u6B27\u8349\u539F) is a steppe ecoregion (a huge stretch of grasslands) in north Eurasia. It stretches from Eastern Europe, Russia, Kazakhstan, to Mongolia and north China. It is south of Siberia.\nFor most of history, nomads lived and wandered there on horseback. The horse may have came from the steppe, around Kazakhstan. With the horses the steppe was a highway that moved people from China to Europe. For this reason it became important for the Silk Road.\nThe steppe has been ruled by many empires. Examples are the Altaic people, Chinese, Slavic people, and Central Asians: including the Xiongnu, Scythians, Han dynasty, Xianbei, Sogdians, Turkic Khaganate, Khazars, Tang Dynasty, Mongol Empire, Russian Empire, and Qing dynasty.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Steppe","surface_form":"steppe","offset":49},{"uri":"Ecoregion","surface_form":"ecoregion","offset":56},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":106},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":149},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":157},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":172},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":191},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":213},{"uri":"Nomads","surface_form":"nomads","offset":243},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":293},{"uri":"Silk_Road","surface_form":"Silk Road","offset":474},{"uri":"Altaic_languages","surface_form":"Altaic","offset":545},{"uri":"Chinese_people","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":560},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":588},{"uri":"Xiongnu","surface_form":"Xiongnu","offset":618},{"uri":"Scythians","surface_form":"Scythians","offset":627},{"uri":"Han_dynasty","surface_form":"Han dynasty","offset":638},{"uri":"Xianbei","surface_form":"Xianbei","offset":651},{"uri":"Sogdians","surface_form":"Sogdians","offset":660},{"uri":"Turkic_Khaganate","surface_form":"Turkic Khaganate","offset":670},{"uri":"Khazars","surface_form":"Khazars","offset":688},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang Dynasty","offset":697},{"uri":"Mongol_Empire","surface_form":"Mongol Empire","offset":711},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":726},{"uri":"Qing_dynasty","surface_form":"Qing dynasty","offset":746}]}
