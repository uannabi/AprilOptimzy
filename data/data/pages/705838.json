{"id":705838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Enfield","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Lee-Enfield is a series of bolt-action rifles that was used by the British Armed Forces. It was the main British rifle for the first half of the 20th century, and was used until the end of the century.\nWhile it was not as powerful as rifles used by other countries during both World War I and World War II, it was well-known for holding a lot of bullets and for having a very high rate of fire.\nThe Lee-Enfield can be loaded with two magazines of five British.303 bullets, allowing for the shooter to have up to ten bullets in the rifle at a time.\nEven though bolt-action rifles tend to fire much more slowly than semi-automatic or fully automatic weapons, the Lee-Enfield can fire almost as fast as a semi-automatic rifle if the shooter is well-trained with the weapon. This is because the rifle's bolt needs very little movement to eject and load the rifle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bolt_action","surface_form":"bolt-action rifles","offset":44},{"uri":"British_Armed_Forces","surface_form":"British Armed Forces","offset":84},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":130},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":162},{"uri":"Century","surface_form":"century","offset":210},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifles","offset":251},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":294},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":310},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullets","offset":363},{"uri":"Rate_of_fire","surface_form":"rate of fire","offset":398},{"uri":"Magazine_(firearms)","surface_form":"magazines","offset":451},{"uri":"British_.303","surface_form":"British.303","offset":469},{"uri":"Semi-automatic_firearm","surface_form":"semi-automatic","offset":631},{"uri":"Automatic_firearm","surface_form":"automatic","offset":655},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapons","offset":665},{"uri":"Bolt_action","surface_form":"bolt","offset":816}]}
