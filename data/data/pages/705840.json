It was their main rifle throughout the Russo-Japanese War, World War I and World War II. After World War II, it was replaced by the SKS rifle. It was also commonly used by the USSR's allies during the Cold War, and it is still used today by some smaller militaries. It is also popular with civilians due to its cheap price. It is the most produced bolt-action rifle of all-time. More than 37 million Mosin-Nagants were made.\nIt holds up five 7.62 x 54mmR bullets, which is still used by Russian machine guns and sniper rifles today.\nIt was the rifle used by Vasily Zaytsev, a Soviet World War II sniper and one of the deadliest snipers of all time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bolt_action","surface_form":"bolt-action","offset":32},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifles","offset":44},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":63},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":92},{"uri":"Russo-Japanese_War","surface_form":"Russo-Japanese War","offset":145},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":165},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":181},{"uri":"SKS","surface_form":"SKS rifle","offset":238},{"uri":"Alliance","surface_form":"allies","offset":289},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":307},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"militaries","offset":360},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilians","offset":396},{"uri":"7.62_x_54mmR","surface_form":"7.62 x 54mmR","offset":548},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine guns","offset":601},{"uri":"Sniper_rifle","surface_form":"sniper rifles","offset":618},{"uri":"Vasily_Zaytsev","surface_form":"Vasily Zaytsev","offset":664},{"uri":"Sniper","surface_form":"sniper","offset":702}]}
