{"id":70585,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover%2C_Pennsylvania","text":"Dover is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,815 at the 2000 census. The United States Census Bureau says the borough has a total area of 1.3 km\u00B2 (0.5 mi\u00B2). All of it is land. There are no lakes or rivers in Dover.\nHistory.\nJames Joner bought 203 acres of land in 1764. On this land, he created the town of Dover. It was known as Jonerstown until 1815, when the name was changed to Dover. Dover was incorporated in 1864, exactly 100 years after its founding.\nIntelligent design controversy.\nDover is most well known for something that happened in 2004-05. The Dover Area School District voted to include a statement about intelligent design in what is taught on about biology in its schools. This action led to the court case \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" in late 2005.\nOn December 20, 2005, Judge John E. Jones III decided in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that a public school district in Pennsylvania cannot teach Intelligent Design in a science class room. He said it was because it is based on a religious belief. The first amendment in the United States Constitution does not allow the government to deal with anything that deals with religious points of view.\n[http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/20/intelligent.design.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4545822.stm] [http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1424896]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"York_County%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"York County","offset":22},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":35},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":49},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":68},{"uri":"United_States_Census_2000","surface_form":"2000 census","offset":96},{"uri":"United_States_Census_Bureau","surface_form":"United States Census Bureau","offset":113},{"uri":"Km%C2%B2","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":182},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"mi\u00B2","offset":191},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":229},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":238},{"uri":"Acre","surface_form":"acre","offset":287},{"uri":"Incorporated_city","surface_form":"incorporated","offset":439},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"founding","offset":489},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":587},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"05","offset":592},{"uri":"Dover_Area_School_District","surface_form":"Dover Area School District","offset":600},{"uri":"Intelligent_design","surface_form":"intelligent design","offset":662},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":708},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":723},{"uri":"Trial","surface_form":"court case","offset":755},{"uri":"Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District","surface_form":"Kitzmiller v.
