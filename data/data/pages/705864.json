{"id":705864,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G98_Mauser_rifle","text":"The G98 Mauser rifle is a bolt-action rifle used by Germany from 1898 until the end of World War I. It was the German military's main rifle during that time. In 1935, it was replaced by Kar98k, a carbine version of the G98.\nIt was not the first bolt-action rifle ever made, but its design is so well-liked by militaries worldwide that many bolt-action rifles copied its design. Some rifles based on the G98 that were made in other countries include the American M1903 Springfield rifle and the Japanese Type 38 and Type 99 Arisaka rifles. Even today, many bolt-action rifles still follow the G98's basic design.\nThe rifle held up to five 7.92 x 57mm Mauser rounds. It was also clip-fed, which means that the shooter can load many bullets at one time, rather than just one bullet at a time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bolt_action","surface_form":"bolt-action","offset":26},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":38},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":87},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military's","offset":118},{"uri":"Kar98_rifle","surface_form":"Kar98k","offset":186},{"uri":"Carbine","surface_form":"carbine","offset":196},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":431},{"uri":"M1903_Springfield_rifle","surface_form":"M1903 Springfield rifle","offset":462},{"uri":"Arisaka_rifle","surface_form":"Arisaka rifles","offset":523},{"uri":"7.92_x_57mm_Mauser","surface_form":"7.92 x 57mm Mauser","offset":638},{"uri":"Clip_(firearms)","surface_form":"clip-fed","offset":677}]}
