{"id":705865,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1903_Springfield_rifle","text":"e=\"preserve\">The M1903 Springfield rifle was a bolt-action rifle used by the Military of the United States during both World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the early part of the Vietnam War.\nThe Springfield was based on the German G98 Mauser rifle. It holds up to five .30-06 Springfield bullets.\nIt was the US's main rifle during World War I. In 1936, it was replaced by the M1 Garand, a semi-automatic rifle. This was because semi-automatic rifles could fire bullets more quickly than bolt-action rifles. This was important because in World War I much of the fighting took place in trenches. In tight spaces like those in trench warfare, it is very important to be able to shoot quickly, and semi-automatic firearms do a better job at that than bolt-action rifles. However, it was still commonly used during World War II, and it became the main sniper rifle for the US. It was the main sniper rifle of the US until the early part of the Vietnam War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bolt_action","surface_form":"bolt-action","offset":47},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":59},{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Military of the United States","offset":77},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":119},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":132},{"uri":"Korean_War","surface_form":"Korean War","offset":150},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":188},{"uri":"G98_Mauser_rifle","surface_form":"G98 Mauser rifle","offset":241},{"uri":".30-06_Springfield","surface_form":".30-06 Springfield","offset":279},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullets","offset":298},{"uri":"M1_Garand","surface_form":"M1 Garand","offset":386},{"uri":"Semi-automatic_rifle","surface_form":"semi-automatic rifle","offset":399},{"uri":"Trench_warfare","surface_form":"trenches","offset":594},{"uri":"Sniper_rifle","surface_form":"sniper rifle","offset":857},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":949}]}
