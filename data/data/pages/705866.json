{"id":705866,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.30-06_Springfield","text":"e=\"preserve\">The.30-06 Springfield cartridge, pronounced \"thirty-aught-six\", is a bullet used for guns made in the United States. It was first used for the M1903 Springfield rifle.\nThe \".30\" means that the bullet is.30 inches (7.62 millimeters) in diameter, and the \"06\" means it was first used in the US military in the year 1906\nThe.30-06 is known for having high stopping power (meaning it does a lot of damage to a human or animal body), high penetration power (it can pierce through thick layers), and a long effective range (it is accurate for a long distance).\nIn the US military, it was the main bullet used for rifles and light machine guns for the first half of the 20th century. Guns that shot the.30-06 include the M1903 Springfield, the M1 Garand, the M1917, the M1919 Browning machine gun, and the BAR.\nHowever, when the US created NATO, it replaced all the.30-06 military weapons with those that used the 7.62 x 51mm NATO bullet. This is because NATO requires the militaries of all its member countries to use the same kinds of ammunition.\nHowever, there are still many American hunting and sporting rifles made today that fire the.30-06 because it is still very popular with hunters and competitive shooters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"cartridge","offset":35},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":82},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"guns","offset":98},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":115},{"uri":"M1903_Springfield_rifle","surface_form":"M1903 Springfield rifle","offset":156},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inches","offset":219},{"uri":"Millimetre","surface_form":"millimeters","offset":232},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":248},{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"US military","offset":302},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":321},{"uri":"Stopping_power","surface_form":"stopping power","offset":366},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":419},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":428},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":435},{"uri":"Effective_range","surface_form":"effective range","offset":514},{"uri":"Light_machine_gun","surface_form":"light machine guns","offset":631},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":676},{"uri":"M1_Garand","surface_form":"M1 Garand","offset":750},{"uri":"M1917_Browning_machine_gun","surface_form":"M1917","offset":765},{"uri":"M1919_Browning_machine_gun","surface_form":"M1919 Browning machine gun","offset":776},{"uri":"M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle","surface_form":"BAR","offset":812},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":846},{"uri":"7.62_x_51mm_NATO","surface_form":"7.62 x 51mm NATO","offset":920},{"uri":"Ammunition","surface_form":"ammunition","offset":1043},{"uri":"Hunting","surface_form":"hunting","offset":1094},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sporting","offset":1106},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competitive","offset":1203}]}
