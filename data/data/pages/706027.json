{"id":706027,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book_reader","text":"e=\"preserve\">An e-reader, also called an e-book reader or e-book device, is a mobile electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading digital e-books and periodicals.\nAny device that can display text on a screen may act as an e-reader, but specialized e-reader devices may optimize portability, readability (especially in sunlight), and battery life for this purpose. Their main advantages over printed books are portability since an e-reader is capable of holding thousands of books while weighing less than one and the convenience provided due to add-on features in these devices.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mobile_computing","surface_form":"mobile electronic device","offset":78},{"uri":"E-book","surface_form":"e-books","offset":165},{"uri":"Periodical_literature","surface_form":"periodicals","offset":177}]}
