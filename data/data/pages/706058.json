{"id":706058,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchison%2C_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway","text":"The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (often referred to as the Santa Fe or AT&SF) was a large railroad in the United States. Created in February 1859, the railroad reached the Kansas-Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo, Colorado, in 1876. To create a demand for its services, the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farm land. Despite the name, its main railroad never served Santa Fe, New Mexico. This was because the terrain was too rough. A branch line from Lamy reached Santa Fe instead.\nThe railroad officially ended on December 31, 1996, when it merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway.\nThe Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF) was created on February 11, 1859, to join Atchison and Topeka, Kansas, with Santa Fe, New Mexico. In its early years, the railroad helped people settle in Kansas. A lot of its revenue came from wheat grown there and from cattle driven north from Texas to Wichita and Dodge City by September 1872.\nAT&SF reached Albuquerque in 1880. Santa Fe (the original goal of the railroad) was on a short branch from Lamy, New Mexico.\nBurlington Northern merger.\nOn September 22, 1995, AT&SF merged with Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway (BNSF). The two lines kept separate operations until December 31, 1996 when it officially became BNSF.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_United_States_railroads","surface_form":"railroad in the United States","offset":99},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":181},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":188},{"uri":"Pueblo%2C_Colorado","surface_form":"Pueblo, Colorado","offset":216},{"uri":"Demand","surface_form":"demand","offset":255},{"uri":"Real_estate","surface_form":"real estate","offset":300},{"uri":"Santa_Fe%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Santa Fe, New Mexico","offset":389},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":432},{"uri":"Branch_line","surface_form":"branch line","offset":457},{"uri":"Lamy%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Lamy","offset":474},{"uri":"Burlington_Northern_Railroad","surface_form":"Burlington Northern Railroad","offset":581},{"uri":"BNSF_Railway","surface_form":"Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway","offset":622},{"uri":"Atchison%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Atchison","offset":754},{"uri":"Topeka%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Topeka, Kansas","offset":767},{"uri":"Santa_Fe%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Santa Fe, New Mexico","offset":788},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":867},{"uri":"Revenue","surface_form":"revenue","offset":888},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":906},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":933},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":958},{"uri":"Wichita%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Wichita","offset":967},{"uri":"Dodge_City%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Dodge City","offset":979},{"uri":"Albuquerque%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Albuquerque","offset":1023},{"uri":"Lamy%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Lamy, New Mexico","offset":1116},{"uri":"Burlington_Northern_Railroad","surface_form":"Burlington Northern Railroad","offset":1203},{"uri":"Burlington_Northern_and_Santa_Fe_Railway","surface_form":"Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway","offset":1244}]}
