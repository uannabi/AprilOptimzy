It was completed in 1962 and rises to 387\u00A0feet (118\u00A0m) in height. The Grade II listed building, which houses the Co-operative Banking Group, is Manchester's fifth-tallest building and the tallest office building in the United Kingdom outside London. The tower remained as built for over 40 years until maintenance issues on the service tower required an extensive renovation which included covering its facade in photovoltaic panels.\nThe office tower building rises above a five-storey podium block.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":58},{"uri":"Listed_building","surface_form":"listed building","offset":158},{"uri":"Co-operative_Banking_Group","surface_form":"Co-operative Banking Group","offset":192},{"uri":"Tallest_buildings_in_Manchester","surface_form":"tallest building","offset":242},{"uri":"Solar_panel","surface_form":"photovoltaic panels","offset":492},{"uri":"Podium","surface_form":"podium","offset":565}]}
