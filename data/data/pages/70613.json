{"id":70613,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)","text":"A trough is an elongated area of comparatively low atmospheric pressure, usually in association with weather fronts.\nConvective cells may form in the surrounding area of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone. Some tropical or subtropical areas, such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough. In the mid-latitude westerlies, troughs and ridges often exchange with each other, especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern. For a trough in the westerlies, the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast, divergent winds and low pressure. Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents, a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atmospheric_pressure","surface_form":"atmospheric pressure","offset":51},{"uri":"Weather_fronts","surface_form":"weather fronts","offset":101},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":198}]}
