{"id":70614,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuikSCAT","text":"The QuikSCAT (Quick Scatterometer) is an earth-observing satellite that provides wind speed and direction information over oceans to NOAA. It is a \"quick recovery\" mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) that was lost in June 1997. It is in a sun-synchronous low-earth orbit.\nBecause of the 2003 failure of the ADEOS II satellite that was meant to succeed the NSCAT, QuickSCAT is currently the only US-owned instrument in orbit that measures surface winds over the oceans. The European Space Agency has its own scatterometers in orbit, such as Envisat.\nHowever, because it is now running on a backup transmitter and having other problems, this satellite could fail at any moment, putting risk at weather forecasts for possibly dangerous tropical cyclones.\nIn early June 2007, Bill Proenza, Director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida, came under fire for criticizing his NOAA superiors for not creating a back-up plan for replacing the capabilities provided by this satellite.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scatterometer","surface_form":"Scatterometer","offset":20},{"uri":"National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","surface_form":"NOAA","offset":133},{"uri":"NSCAT","surface_form":"NSCAT","offset":245},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":274},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":317},{"uri":"ADEOS_II/Midori_II","surface_form":"ADEOS II","offset":359},{"uri":"European_Space_Agency","surface_form":"European Space Agency","offset":525},{"uri":"Envisat","surface_form":"Envisat","offset":592},{"uri":"Backup","surface_form":"backup","offset":641},{"uri":"Transmitter","surface_form":"transmitter","offset":648},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":785},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":818},{"uri":"Bill_Proenza","surface_form":"Bill Proenza","offset":824},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":854},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":883},{"uri":"NOAA","surface_form":"NOAA","offset":928}]}
