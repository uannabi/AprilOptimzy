{"id":706600,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol_Naval_Base","text":"The Sevastopol Naval Base is a naval base located in Sevastopol, Crimea. It the main base of Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet.\nHistory.\nWork to build the port was started in 1772. At the time, the Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774) was happening. Russia had annexed Crimea, and finished the port in 1783. On 13 May 1783, the first eleven ships of the Imperial Russian Navy reached the Sevastopol Bay.\nIn the Crimean War (1853\u20131856), all large ships were sunk on purpose in the entrance to the bay. This was done to stop enemy ships from being able to enter the bay. The city defended itself for 349 days against France, the United Kingdom, the Ottoman Empire and Piedmont-Sardinia. On 9 September 1855 the Russians left Sevastopol.\nDuring World War I, the German army took over Sevastopol on 1 May 1918. Later, a few ships from the Black Sea Fleet were sunk by their crews.\nDuring World War II, the Black Sea Fleet of the Soviet Navy was at first able to defend against Nazi Germany. However, after the city defended itself for 250 days, Sevastopol fell to the Germans on 4 July 1942.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, Sevastopol became part of Ukraine. Russia made a treaty with Ukraine to use the base for the Russian Navy. In order to do so, Russia paid an annual amount to Ukraine. Since the Russia took over Crimea in 2014, the base is under Russian control.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Naval_base","surface_form":"naval base","offset":31},{"uri":"Sevastopol","surface_form":"Sevastopol","offset":53},{"uri":"Crimea","surface_form":"Crimea","offset":65},{"uri":"Russian_Navy","surface_form":"Russian Navy","offset":93},{"uri":"Black_Sea_Fleet","surface_form":"Black Sea Fleet","offset":108},{"uri":"Russo-Turkish_War_(1768%E2%80%931774)","surface_form":"Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)","offset":195},{"uri":"Annexation","surface_form":"annexed","offset":251},{"uri":"Imperial_Russian_Navy","surface_form":"Imperial Russian Navy","offset":344},{"uri":"Sevastopol_Bay","surface_form":"Sevastopol Bay","offset":378},{"uri":"Crimean_War","surface_form":"Crimean War","offset":401},{"uri":"Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854%E2%80%9355)","surface_form":"defended itself for 349 days","offset":568},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":605},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":617},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":637},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Sardinia","surface_form":"Piedmont-Sardinia","offset":656},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":732},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":749},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":874},{"uri":"Soviet_Navy","surface_form":"Soviet Navy","offset":915},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":963},{"uri":"Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941%E2%80%9342)","surface_form":"defended itself for 250 days","offset":1001},{"uri":"Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"dissolution of the Soviet Union","offset":1088},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1175},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":1201},{"uri":"Russian_Navy","surface_form":"Russian Navy","offset":1233},{"uri":"Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation","surface_form":"Russia took over Crimea","offset":1317}]}
