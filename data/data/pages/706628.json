It goes from central Nebraska into Kansas, until its confluence with the Kansas River at Manhattan.\nIts name was given from the Kansa tribe of Native Americans. They lived at its mouth from 1780 to 1830. They called it the Great Blue Earth River.\nRiver course.\nThe river goes through mostly agricultural land. Big towns on the river include: Manhattan, Kansas, Beatrice, Nebraska; Crete, Nebraska; and Seward, Nebraska.\nWater rights.\nNebraska and Kansas have an agreement on who gets to use the water. Nebraska has full use of the river's water. However, from May 1 to September 30, Nebraska must allow a certain amount to go into Kansas. There has been no shortage of water in the river.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":34},{"uri":"Kansas_River","surface_form":"Kansas River","offset":51},{"uri":"Nebraska","surface_form":"Nebraska","offset":111},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":125},{"uri":"Confluence","surface_form":"confluence","offset":143},{"uri":"Manhattan%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":179},{"uri":"Kaw_(tribe)","surface_form":"Kansa","offset":218},{"uri":"Mouth_(river)","surface_form":"mouth","offset":269},{"uri":"Agricultural","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":381},{"uri":"Beatrice%2C_Nebraska","surface_form":"Beatrice, Nebraska","offset":451},{"uri":"Crete%2C_Nebraska","surface_form":"Crete, Nebraska","offset":471},{"uri":"Seward%2C_Nebraska","surface_form":"Seward, Nebraska","offset":492},{"uri":"Shortage","surface_form":"shortage","offset":747}]}
