{"id":706669,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegro","text":"e=\"preserve\">Allegro is a tempo marking for classical music. It says that the music is to be played moderately fast. At first, it was also used to describe the character of a piece, but since the 18th centrury, it is mainly used for the speed. It is faster than Andante, but slower than Presto. Sometimes, the term is translated: Composers such as Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel used the word \"vite\", Gustav Mahler wrote Rasch, and Benjamin Britten wrote \"Quickly\". Most people say that piece that is played allegro should generally be played at speeds of between 120 and 168 beats per minute.\nSometimes Allegro is used in the title of musical pieces, for example the Allegro barbaro by Bela Bartok.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":44},{"uri":"Andante","surface_form":"Andante","offset":262},{"uri":"Presto","surface_form":"Presto","offset":287},{"uri":"Claude_Debussy","surface_form":"Claude Debussy","offset":348},{"uri":"Maurice_Ravel","surface_form":"Maurice Ravel","offset":367},{"uri":"Gustav_Mahler","surface_form":"Gustav Mahler","offset":403},{"uri":"Benjamin_Britten","surface_form":"Benjamin Britten","offset":434},{"uri":"Allegro_barbaro","surface_form":"Allegro barbaro","offset":670},{"uri":"B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k","surface_form":"Bela Bartok","offset":689}]}
