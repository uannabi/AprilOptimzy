The bullet is the same size, but the case is a little smaller so soldiers could carry more bullets. It was the main bullet used by NATO until the 5.56 x 45mm NATO was invented.\nGuns that use the 7.62 NATO include the M14, the FN FAL, the G3, the SCAR, the M240, and the M21.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullets","offset":49},{"uri":"Battle_rifle","surface_form":"battle rifles","offset":66},{"uri":"Sniper_rifle","surface_form":"sniper rifles","offset":81},{"uri":"Light_machine_gun","surface_form":"light machine guns","offset":100},{"uri":"NATO","surface_form":"NATO","offset":127},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":132},{"uri":".30-06_Springfield","surface_form":".30-06 Springfield","offset":162},{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"catridge","offset":181},{"uri":"5.56mm_NATO","surface_form":"5.56 x 45mm NATO","offset":337},{"uri":"M14_rifle","surface_form":"M14","offset":408},{"uri":"FN_FAL_rifle","surface_form":"FN FAL","offset":417},{"uri":"Heckler_%26amp%3B_Koch_G3","surface_form":"G3","offset":429},{"uri":"SCAR_rifle","surface_form":"SCAR","offset":437},{"uri":"M240_machine_gun","surface_form":"M240","offset":447},{"uri":"M21_rifle","surface_form":"M21","offset":461}]}
