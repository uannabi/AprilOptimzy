{"id":706754,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_power","text":"=\"preserve\">Penetration power is how deep a weapon can pierce through or shoot through a surface.\nFor guns, rifle bullets can usually penetrate, or shoot through, deeper than pistol bullets or shotgun shells because they are narrower and faster. This is why most bullet-proof vests can stop pistol bullets and shotgun shells, but not rifle bullets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":44},{"uri":"Surface","surface_form":"surface","offset":89},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"guns","offset":102},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":108},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullets","offset":114},{"uri":"Pistol","surface_form":"pistol","offset":175},{"uri":"Shotgun_shell","surface_form":"shotgun shells","offset":193},{"uri":"Bullet-proof_vest","surface_form":"bullet-proof vests","offset":263}]}
