{"id":706763,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1919_Browning_machine_gun","text":"The M1919 Browning machine gun was a .30-06 Springfield light machine gun that mostly replaced the M1917 during World War II.\nIt was one of the earliest air-cooled machine guns. It overheated more quickly than the M1917, which was water-cooled, but it was much lighter. It fired slowly enough so that a soldier who was well-trained in shooting in bursts would not overheat the gun.\nThe M1919 was well-known for being powerful, accurate, and reliable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":".30-06_Springfield","surface_form":".30-06 Springfield","offset":37},{"uri":"Light_machine_gun","surface_form":"light machine gun","offset":56},{"uri":"M1917_Browning_machine_gun","surface_form":"M1917","offset":99},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":112},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine guns","offset":164}]}
