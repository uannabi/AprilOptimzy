{"id":706977,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar98_rifle","text":"The Kar98 is a German bolt-action rifle and it was the German military's main gun during World War II. It is a carbine version of the G98. The Kar98 was made because the G98 was too long to be used well in small spaces.\nAt the end of World War II, many German soldiers had to give up their weapons, including the Kar98. Despite it being the main gun used by Nazi Germany, it was often used by Israeli soldiers in the 1947-1949 Palestine War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bolt_action","surface_form":"bolt-action","offset":22},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":34},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":55},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military's","offset":62},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":89},{"uri":"Carbine","surface_form":"carbine","offset":111},{"uri":"G98_Mauser_rifle","surface_form":"G98","offset":134},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapons","offset":290},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":358},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israeli","offset":393},{"uri":"1947-1949_Palestine_War","surface_form":"1947-1949 Palestine War","offset":417}]}
