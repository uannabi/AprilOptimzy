Ch\u00E1vez started the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) along with Dolores Huerta. He wanted equal rights for Mexicans working in the United States. This union became the United Farm Workers. He led a boycott against grape companies to gain rights for workers. Ch\u00E1vez used nonviolence to make these changes. Chavez is thought of as one of the leaders in the movement for Chicanos to gain more rights in the late-20th century.\nEarly life.\nCh\u00E1vez was born near Yuma, Arizona and went to over 37 schools. He graduated from the eighth grade. He did most of his organizing in California, especially near Bakersfield. Fred Ross taught him to lead unions. Fred Ross was a student of Saul Alinsky.\nActivism.\nIn 1965, Ch\u00E1vez and the NFWA started a strike for grape-pickers in California. At the same time, he asked Americans to boycott grapes from California. In 1970, the migrant workers won their fight for better pay.\nHe kept working against unfair labor rules. He stopped eating in protest three times because of low pay and bad working conditions. When he died, was leading another grape boycott to stop the use of pesticides.\nLegacy.\nCh\u00E1vez is respected in California and other states. In 2000, California's state legislature started a holiday to honor him. The holiday is on March 31, Ch\u00E1vez's birthday. This is the first time that a US public holiday honored a Mexican American or a union leader. Many cities have streets or places named for him. These cities include San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Austin, Texas, Chicago, Illinois, Milwaukee, and Salt Lake City. In 1998 he was inducted into the Hall of Honor by the United States Department of Labor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dolores_Huerta","surface_form":"Dolores Huerta","offset":210},{"uri":"Equal_rights","surface_form":"equal rights","offset":236},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexicans","offset":253},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":277},{"uri":"United_Farm_Workers","surface_form":"United Farm Workers","offset":314},{"uri":"Boycott","surface_form":"boycott","offset":344},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":360},{"uri":"Nonviolence","surface_form":"nonviolence","offset":416},{"uri":"Chicano","surface_form":"Chicano","offset":514},{"uri":"Yuma%2C_Arizona","surface_form":"Yuma, Arizona","offset":602},{"uri":"Eighth_grade","surface_form":"eighth grade","offset":667},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":714},{"uri":"Bakersfield%2C_California","surface_form":"Bakersfield","offset":742},{"uri":"Fred_Ross","surface_form":"Fred Ross","offset":755},{"uri":"Saul_Alinsky","surface_form":"Saul Alinsky","offset":819},{"uri":"Strike_action","surface_form":"strike","offset":882},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":910},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":982},{"uri":"Migrant_worker","surface_form":"migrant worker","offset":1007},{"uri":"Hunger_strike","surface_form":"stopped eating in protest","offset":1102},{"uri":"Pesticide","surface_form":"pesticide","offset":1254},{"uri":"State_legislature","surface_form":"state legislature","offset":1348},{"uri":"Mexican_American","surface_form":"Mexican American","offset":1503},{"uri":"San_Francisco%2C_California","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":1610},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":1625},{"uri":"Albuquerque%2C_New_Mexico","surface_form":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","offset":1638},{"uri":"Austin%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Austin, Texas","offset":1663},{"uri":"Chicago%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Chicago, Illinois","offset":1678},{"uri":"Milwaukee%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Milwaukee","offset":1697},{"uri":"Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah","surface_form":"Salt Lake City","offset":1712},{"uri":"U.S._Department_of_Labor_Hall_of_Honor","surface_form":"Hall of Honor","offset":1761},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Labor","surface_form":"United States Department of Labor","offset":1782}]}
