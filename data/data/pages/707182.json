{"id":707182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_heat_capacity","text":"e=\"preserve\">The molar heat capacity of a substance is the energy needed to raise the temperature of one mole of it by one degree Celsius.\nWhen using SI units, it can be calculated with the equation formula_1\nwhere formula_1 refers to the molar heat capcity (in joules per Kelvin), formula_1 to the heat supplied (in joules) and formula_1 (in Kelvin) to the temperature change in the substance.\nThe molar heat capacity of a given substance can be found by heating the substance by releasing a known amount of energy into the substance and measuring the temperature change.\nFor example, a common school experiment to find the molar heat capacity of water involves heating a beaker of water with an immersion heater (that can display the heat released in joules on a display) and stirring the water, while checking the temperature at specific intervals.\nFor more accurate results, a bomb calorimeter can be used; these contain a chamber of fuel (in this case, a compound that will release heat when needed) inside a chamber of water, with the water chamber protected by heat-proof walls (to ensure minimal heat loss, which would affect the final heat capacity recorded).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":59},{"uri":"Mole_(unit)","surface_form":"mole","offset":105},{"uri":"Immersion_heater","surface_form":"immersion heater","offset":697},{"uri":"Bomb_calorimeter","surface_form":"bomb calorimeter","offset":881}]}
