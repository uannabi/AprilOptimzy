{"id":707185,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneity_(chemistry)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The spontaneity of a process refers to whether or not the reaction would occur without an input of energy, because of the value of the reaction's Gibbs free energy.\nwhere formula_1 refers to the Gibbs free energy, formula_1to the enthalpy change, formula_1 to the temperature (in Kelvin) and formula_1 to the entropy change.\nIf the Gibbs free energy change is 0 or negative, the reaction is said to be spontaneous and can occur without an input of energy into the system. If the Gibbs free energy were above 0, the reaction would not be spontaneous and would require an input of energy in order for it to proceed.\nIf the formation of compounds formula_1 and formula_1 from formula_1 were spontaneous, the formation of compound formula_1 from formula_1 and formula_1 would be non-spontaneous.\nAn example of a spontaneous process is the conversion of diamond into graphite, because graphite has a more thermodynamically stable structure. An example of a non-spontaneous process would be the combustion of methane in oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, as this requires an input of energy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_reaction","surface_form":"reaction","offset":71},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":112},{"uri":"Gibbs_free_energy","surface_form":"Gibbs free energy","offset":159},{"uri":"Enthalpy","surface_form":"enthalpy","offset":243},{"uri":"Diamond","surface_form":"diamond","offset":862},{"uri":"Graphite","surface_form":"graphite","offset":875},{"uri":"Methane","surface_form":"methane","offset":1016},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":1027},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":1042},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1061}]}
