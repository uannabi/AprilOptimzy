The highway's western endpoint is in Granada, Colorado, at an intersection with US\u00A0385. The highway's eastern endpoint is southwest of Joplin, Missouri, near Loma Linda, at an interchange with Interstate 44. It originally ended in Garden City, Kansas; in 1996 it was made longer to its current western endpoint. Its route number does not follow the usual AASHTO numbering scheme, as there is no \"parent\" US\u00A00.\nColorado.\nUS 400 begins in Granada at an intersection with US 385.
