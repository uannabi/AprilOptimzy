They began their career as a double act in 1954.\nBoth Jimmy and Brian made appearances in the children's television series \"ChuckleVision,\" alongside their younger brothers Paul and Barry. Jimmy is known as \"No Slacking\" due to the catchphrase.\nFor three months, all four brothers appeared together on the game show \"3-2-1\" with Ted Rogers on 17 April 1982 (Season 4, Episode 13), and also on \"New Faces\". Afterwards, Jimmy and Brian returned to being the Patton Brothers.\nOn 25 July 2019, Jimmy died of cancer at the age of 87.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Double_act","surface_form":"double act","offset":144},{"uri":"Chuckle_Brothers","surface_form":"Chuckle Brothers","offset":213},{"uri":"Double_act","surface_form":"double act","offset":260},{"uri":"ChuckleVision","surface_form":"ChuckleVision","offset":355},{"uri":"Catchphrase","surface_form":"catchphrase","offset":463},{"uri":"3-2-1","surface_form":"3-2-1","offset":548},{"uri":"Ted_Rogers_(comedian)","surface_form":"Ted Rogers","offset":560},{"uri":"New_Faces","surface_form":"New Faces","offset":625},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":735}]}
