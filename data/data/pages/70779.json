{"id":70779,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_sweetener","text":"An artificial sweetener or sugar substitute is a chemical. It is added to some foods to make them taste sweet. It is made to taste like sugar or corn syrup. Usually it has a much lower energy value than sugar. It can be found in many products which say \"Light\" or \"Diet\" in their name.\nProblems.\nStudies done with animals have shown that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain. A sweet taste causes insulin to be produced. This will store some of the sugar in the blood in tissues, including fat. With artificial sweeteners, the amount of sugar in the blood does not increase. This means that there will be too little sugar in the blood. This is known as hypoglycemia. On the next meal, more food will be eaten to get the blood sugar level back to normal values.\nAfter a while, rats given sweeteners have steadily increased the amount of calories. This increased body weight, and adiposity (fatness). The natural response to eating sugary foods is to eat less at the next meal and to use some of the extra energy to warm the body after the meal. When using artificial sweeteners, this effect is lost gradually.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":49},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":79},{"uri":"Sweet_(taste)","surface_form":"sweet","offset":104},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":136},{"uri":"Corn","surface_form":"corn","offset":145},{"uri":"Syrup","surface_form":"syrup","offset":150},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy value","offset":185},{"uri":"Insulin","surface_form":"insulin","offset":400},{"uri":"Hypoglycemia","surface_form":"hypoglycemia","offset":656},{"uri":"Rat","surface_form":"rat","offset":779}]}
