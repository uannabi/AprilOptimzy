{"id":70787,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger","text":"Lawrence Mark Sanger (born July 16, 1968) is an American internet project developer. He worked with Jimmy Wales to create the internet encyclopedias, Nupedia and Wikipedia before he created his own online encyclopedias Digital Universe and Citizendium.\nCareer.\nWales, through his company Bomis, paid Sanger to help them to maintain Nupedia.\nOn January 2, 2001, Ben Kovitz, Sanger's friend, had the idea to use a wiki to help to make Nupedia better. Sanger in turn told Wales, and on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia was launched. There are different opinions on which of the three people are most responsible for Wikipedia.\nIn 2005, Sanger created Digital Universe, an online encyclopedia like Wikipedia.\nIn 2006, Sanger created Citizendium, another online encyclopedia. Citizendium uses the MediaWiki engine (like Wikipedia) but the rules are different. People must use their given names on Citizendium and experts are given special status in approving articles.\nIn December 2017, Sanger joined Everipedia. He left the project in 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jimmy_Wales","surface_form":"Jimmy Wales","offset":100},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":126},{"uri":"Encyclopedias","surface_form":"encyclopedias","offset":135},{"uri":"Nupedia","surface_form":"Nupedia","offset":150},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":162},{"uri":"Online","surface_form":"online","offset":198},{"uri":"Digital_Universe","surface_form":"Digital Universe","offset":219},{"uri":"Citizendium","surface_form":"Citizendium","offset":240},{"uri":"Bomis","surface_form":"Bomis","offset":288},{"uri":"Ben_Kovitz","surface_form":"Ben Kovitz","offset":361},{"uri":"Wiki","surface_form":"wiki","offset":412},{"uri":"MediaWiki","surface_form":"MediaWiki","offset":787},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":797},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"People","offset":850},{"uri":"Given_name","surface_form":"given name","offset":872},{"uri":"Everipedia","surface_form":"Everipedia","offset":991}]}
