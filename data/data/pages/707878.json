{"id":707878,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher","text":"A rocket launcher is a weapon that shoots rockets. Rockets are explosives that fly towards their targets by burning fuel. Some rocket launchers are mounted on a truck, and others are a type of recoilless rifle.\nThey were invented by the Chinese after they discovered gun powder. In World War II, rocket launchers became powerful enough to destroy tanks.\nMany people mistakenly call all rocket launchers bazookas, but the bazooka is only one type of rocket launcher. Other rocket launchers include the RPG-7, the LAW, the AT-4, the SMAW, and the Panzerschreck.\nRocket launchers are different from missile launchers because some missiles can follow their target even if they were not aimed straight at them, but rockets cannot.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":23},{"uri":"Explosive_material","surface_form":"explosives","offset":63},{"uri":"Fuel","surface_form":"fuel","offset":116},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":161},{"uri":"Recoilless_rifle","surface_form":"recoilless rifle","offset":193},{"uri":"Gunpowder","surface_form":"gun powder","offset":267},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":282},{"uri":"Tank","surface_form":"tanks","offset":347},{"uri":"Bazooka","surface_form":"bazookas","offset":403},{"uri":"Rocket-propelled_grenade","surface_form":"RPG-7","offset":501},{"uri":"M72_LAW","surface_form":"LAW","offset":512},{"uri":"AT-4","surface_form":"AT-4","offset":521},{"uri":"SMAW","surface_form":"SMAW","offset":531},{"uri":"Panzerschreck","surface_form":"Panzerschreck","offset":545},{"uri":"Missile","surface_form":"missiles","offset":627}]}
