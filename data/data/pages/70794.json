{"id":70794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_power","text":"=\"preserve\">\"Flower power\" was a 1960s slogan, used by hippies and other people who were against war and violence. It was a symbol of passive resistance and non-violence ideology.\nThese people used flowers as a symbol of life, of love, and of peace. They wore flowers, made art with flowers and images of them, and gave them away often. Hippies sometimes placed flowers in the rifle barrels of marching soldiers.\nSongs such as \"San Francisco, Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair\" by folk musicians The Mamas & the Papas were associated with flower power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":33},{"uri":"Slogan","surface_form":"slogan","offset":39},{"uri":"Hippie","surface_form":"hippie","offset":55},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":97},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":105},{"uri":"Passive_resistance","surface_form":"passive resistance","offset":134},{"uri":"Non-violence","surface_form":"non-violence","offset":157},{"uri":"Ideology","surface_form":"ideology","offset":170},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":198},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":211},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":295},{"uri":"Rifle","surface_form":"rifle","offset":377},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":403},{"uri":"The_Mamas_%26amp%3B_the_Papas","surface_form":"The Mamas & the Papas","offset":499}]}
