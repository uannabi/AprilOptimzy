{"id":707967,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_regeneration_(video_games)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Health regeneration is a feature in video games where if the player takes damage, they can get back the health they lost if they wait and do not take any more damage. The first game with this feature was \"Punch Out!!\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\nMan people think \"Halo\" was the first First-person shooter game to have health regeneration, but it was not. Health regeneration was not even in the first \"Halo\" game, but it was added in \"Halo 2\" and was a feature in most \"Halo\" games since then. Even so, it has existed in shooter games before \"Halo\". Nonetheless, since \"Halo 2\", it became more common to have have health regeneration instead of health bars and it later became standard in shooter games. Other shooter games that use health regeneration include the \"Call of Duty\" games, the \"Gears of War\" games, and the \"Sniper Elite\" games.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":49},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":117},{"uri":"Punch-Out%21%21_(series)","surface_form":"Punch Out!!","offset":218},{"uri":"Nintendo_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"Nintendo Entertainment System","offset":239},{"uri":"Combat_Evolved","surface_form":"Halo","offset":288},{"uri":"First-person_shooter","surface_form":"First-person shooter","offset":308},{"uri":"Halo_2","surface_form":"Halo 2","offset":459},{"uri":"Health_bar_(video_games)","surface_form":"health bars","offset":669},{"uri":"Call_of_Duty_series","surface_form":"Call of Duty","offset":790},{"uri":"Gears_of_War","surface_form":"Gears of War","offset":816},{"uri":"Sniper_Elite_series","surface_form":"Sniper Elite","offset":846}]}
