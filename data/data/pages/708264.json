{"id":708264,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(vehicle)","text":"A trailer vehicle is a vehicle that does not have any engine, and instead is attached to another vehicle to move, which could be another trailer or a truck, but the vehicle at the front almost always has an engine to let the trailers move.\nTrailers may be used for carrying cargo either being things that are not alive or sometimes animals like horses that are too big for the main vehicle. Some boats might also be a trailer as well to allow them to be moved on land.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":23},{"uri":"Truck","surface_form":"truck","offset":150},{"uri":"Cargo","surface_form":"cargo","offset":274},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":345}]}
