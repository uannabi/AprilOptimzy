{"id":70839,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vattenfall_Cyclassics","text":"The Vattenfall Cyclassics is a cycling race held every year in Hamburg, Germany.\nIt started as an unimportant race in 1996, but because cycling became very popular in Germany it was made a part of the UCI Road World Cup in 1998. Since 2005, it is a part of the UCI ProTour.\nThe route of the race changes, but is about 250\u00A0km long. During a number of laps through Hamburg, the Waseberg hill is climbed a several times. The cyclists also race over Hamburg's highest bridge K\u00F6hlbrandbr\u00FCcke. Unlike many races the Cyclassic race almost never ends in a \"mass sprint\", that is, with a lot of riders close together racing to the finish line.\nThere is an amateur part of the Cyclassics. Earlier on the day of the race there are three \"Jedermann-Rennen\". Anybody (\"jedermann\") with a ticket can take part in these races (\"rennen\") over 55\u00A0km, 100\u00A0km and 155\u00A0km. Tickets must be reserved months in advance. In 2005 there were 20000 amateurs on the course.\nThe sponsor of the Cyclassics, was the \"Hamburg Electrizit\u00E4t Werke\", Hamburg electricity plant or \"HEW\", after it became part of the big \"Vattenfall\" company the Cyclassic changed its name too, and from 2006 this cycling race has been known as the Vattenfall Cyclassics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":63},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":72},{"uri":"UCI_Road_World_Cup","surface_form":"UCI Road World Cup","offset":201},{"uri":"UCI_ProTour","surface_form":"UCI ProTour","offset":261},{"uri":"Waseberg","surface_form":"Waseberg","offset":376},{"uri":"K%C3%B6hlbrandbr%C3%BCcke","surface_form":"K\u00F6hlbrandbr\u00FCcke","offset":471},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":900},{"uri":"Vattenfall","surface_form":"Vattenfall","offset":1084}]}
