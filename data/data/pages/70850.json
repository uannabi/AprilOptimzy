It was shown on the ABC in Australia from 2006-2009. The series is replayed on Friday nights and again (on a different channel) on Sunday nights. The series is hosted by a group of men called The Chaser.\nOverview.\nThe series has the men doing stunts and tricks. Sometimes these tricks have been known to be dangerous (such as in one episode, cutting across lanes of traffic to stay behind a mobile advertisement), causing the television program Today Tonight to show a story on how dangerous this stunt was. At the end of each episode, there is a parody song performed, usually about the national government.\nStunts.\nOne of the most famous tricks that has been on the series was when the group tricked security at the APEC Meeting in Sydney in 2007. They drove past two checkpoints in a fake motorcade, using fake access passes. One member of The Chaser was dressed up as Osama bin Laden, causing a massive security scare just metres from where George Bush was staying. 13 crew members were arrested, charged and later released on bail.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":38},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":45},{"uri":"Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation","surface_form":"the ABC","offset":80},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":91},{"uri":"The_Chaser","surface_form":"The Chaser","offset":256},{"uri":"Stunt","surface_form":"stunt","offset":307},{"uri":"Advertisement","surface_form":"advertisement","offset":462},{"uri":"Today_Tonight","surface_form":"Today Tonight","offset":509},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":591},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parody","offset":611},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":661},{"uri":"Security","surface_form":"security","offset":766},{"uri":"APEC_Australia_2007","surface_form":"APEC Meeting","offset":782},{"uri":"Sydney%2C_Australia","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":798},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":808},{"uri":"Checkpoint","surface_form":"checkpoint","offset":834},{"uri":"Motorcade","surface_form":"motorcade","offset":856},{"uri":"Osama_bin_Laden","surface_form":"Osama bin Laden","offset":936},{"uri":"George_W_Bush","surface_form":"George Bush","offset":1009},{"uri":"Arrest","surface_form":"arrest","offset":1055},{"uri":"Bail","surface_form":"bail","offset":1095}]}
