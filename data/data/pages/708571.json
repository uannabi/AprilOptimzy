He was leader of the Labour Party from 1949 to 1984, and was 8th Prime Minister of Malta from 1955 to 1958 and from 1971 to 1984.\nHis tenure as Prime Minister has been seen with mixed views because he helped create better living conditions of the Maltese people but saw a rise in authoritarianism and political violence.\nMintoff was taken to hospital on 18 July 2012. He was later discharged on 4 August and spent his 96th birthday at home in Tarxien. He died there sixteen days later on 20 August 2012.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Labour_Party_(Malta)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":177},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Malta","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Malta","offset":221},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":300},{"uri":"Authoritarianism","surface_form":"authoritarianism","offset":436},{"uri":"Tarxien","surface_form":"Tarxien","offset":599}]}
