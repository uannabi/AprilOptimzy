The five members of the group were Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick, and Justin Timberlake. The group's second album, No Strings Attached, sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42 million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. They also provided songs on the Billboard Hot 100 including Bye Bye Bye, Tearin' Up My Heart and It's Gonna Be Me, which became NSYNC's only number-one song on the chart. They took a break after their very last concert on March 30, 2002, but never released new music since. Afterwards, Timberlake and Chasez released solo albums. Justin Timberlake went on to become one of the world's best-selling music artists, with more than 56 million records sold throughout his solo career.\nLegacy.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked NSYNC as the best boy band of the period late 90s and 2000s; editor Madelne Boardman stated, \"the group has a spot in pop history more than a decade late.\" \"The Washington Post\" stated it was one of the two boy bands \"that dominated the late '90s and early '00s.\" According to \"Billboard\", \"No Strings Attached\" was the top album of the 2000s (decade), with \"The Independent\" listing it among the albums \"that marked the decade.\" \"Billboard\" also ranked the group at number four on their list of the biggest boy bands (from the period 1987\u20132012) according to chart performance, with the staff writing, \"despite having one of the most short-lived boy band careers, 'N Sync was arguably the most famous.\" Several acts have cited the group as an influence, including Kelsea Ballerini, Selena Gomez, Meghan Trainor, Why Don't We and Hayley Williams.
