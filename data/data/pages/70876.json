{"id":70876,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Curie","text":"Pierre Curie (15 May 1859 in Paris \u2013 19 April 1906 in Paris) was a French physicist. He shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife, Marie Curie and Henri Becquerel, for the work on 'spontaneous radioactivity' which Becquerel discovered.\nWork.\nPierre Curie is not as well known as Marie Curie, although Pierre and his brother had done a lot of work before Pierre's marriage and work with Marie. They were the first to use the term 'radioactivity', and were pioneers in its study. Pierre and his brother, Jacques Curie, built a special meter for measuring small amounts of electricity which Pierre and Marie used in their other discoveries.\nPierre died after a carriage accident in Paris on 19 April 1906. His head was crushed under the wheels. If he had lived he would probably have died by radiation poisoning, as Marie did. As they were the first to study radioactivity, they did not know how dangerous it was.\nAfter Pierre's death, a group of scientists at the Radiology Congress decided to honour him by naming the unit of radioactivity a curie.\nChildren.\nPierre and Marie Curie's daughter Ir\u00E8ne Joliot-Curie and their son-in-law Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Joliot-Curie were also physicists involved in the study of radioactivity, and were also given the Nobel prize for their work. Their other daughter \u00C8ve wrote her mother's biography. His granddaughter H\u00E9l\u00E8ne Langevin-Joliot is a professor of nuclear physics at the University of Paris and his grandson, Pierre Joliot, who was named after him, is a noted biochemist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":29},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":67},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":74},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":104},{"uri":"Marie_Curie","surface_form":"Marie Curie","offset":142},{"uri":"Henri_Becquerel","surface_form":"Henri Becquerel","offset":158},{"uri":"Radioactivity","surface_form":"radioactivity","offset":204},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":581},{"uri":"Radiation","surface_form":"radiation","offset":800},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":955},{"uri":"Curie_(unit)","surface_form":"curie","offset":1052},{"uri":"Ir%C3%A8ne_Joliot-Curie","surface_form":"Ir\u00E8ne Joliot-Curie","offset":1103},{"uri":"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Joliot-Curie","surface_form":"Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Joliot-Curie","offset":1143},{"uri":"%C3%88ve_Curie","surface_form":"\u00C8ve","offset":1299},{"uri":"H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Langevin-Joliot","surface_form":"H\u00E9l\u00E8ne Langevin-Joliot","offset":1351},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":1379},{"uri":"University_of_Paris","surface_form":"University of Paris","offset":1415},{"uri":"Pierre_Joliot","surface_form":"Pierre Joliot","offset":1453},{"uri":"Biochemist","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":1504}]}
