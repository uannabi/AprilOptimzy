{"id":709000,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break-open_shotgun","text":"e=\"preserve\">A break-open shotgun is a type of shotgun that loads shotgun shells by opening up the barrels, taking out the spent shells, placing a new shell in each chamber, then closing the barrels. Most are either single- or double-barrel. Triple- and quadruple-barrel (four barrel) shotguns also exist, but single- and double-barrel shotguns are easier to make and less likely to jam.\nMost double-barrel shotguns are made with their barrels touching side-by-side. However, there are also shotguns where one barrel is on top of the other. Over-and-under shotguns are easier to aim than side-by-side shotguns because you do not need to aim a little to the left or right.\nSince the metal cartridge was invented in 1845, most shotguns were break-open shotguns until the repeating shotgun was invented. However, break-open shotguns are still popular with civilians because they are easier to use and less likely to jam than repeating shotguns. Nonetheless, they hold fewer shells than repeating shotguns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shotgun","surface_form":"shotgun","offset":47},{"uri":"Shotgun_shell","surface_form":"shotgun shells","offset":66},{"uri":"Chamber_(firearms)","surface_form":"chamber","offset":165},{"uri":"Double-barrel_shotgun","surface_form":"double-barrel","offset":227},{"uri":"Jam_(firearms)","surface_form":"jam","offset":383},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":682},{"uri":"Cartridge_(firearms)","surface_form":"cartridge","offset":688},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invented","offset":702},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilians","offset":853}]}
