It was taught in German schools from 1915 to 1941.\nIn the 19th century the common form of German handwriting was German Kurrent. It uses very thin lines and sharp edges. Many students in primary school found it difficult to learn. So in 1911 the German designer and teacher Ludwig S\u00FCtterlin was asked to design a simpler script. S\u00FCtterlin script has thicker lines and rounder edges than German Kurrent. It can be easily written with any pen.\nIn everyday language some people call any handwritten blackletter script \"S\u00FCtterlin\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":62},{"uri":"German_Kurrent","surface_form":"German Kurrent","offset":195},{"uri":"Primary_school","surface_form":"primary school","offset":269},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"script","offset":403},{"uri":"Pen","surface_form":"pen","offset":519},{"uri":"Blackletter","surface_form":"blackletter","offset":578}]}
