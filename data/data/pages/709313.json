{"id":709313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)","text":"In concurrent computing, multiple calculations are made within overlapping time frames. It takes advantage of the concept that multiple threads or processes can make progress on a task asynchronously. This general approach to writing and executing computer programs is called concurrency.\nConcurrency is different from parallel computing, as parallel computing uses multiple processors, each of which are assigned a single, synchronous thread.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_program","surface_form":"computer program","offset":248},{"uri":"Parallel_computing","surface_form":"parallel computing","offset":319},{"uri":"Processor","surface_form":"processor","offset":375}]}
