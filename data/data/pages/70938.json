{"id":70938,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Dominican_Republic","text":"The Constitution of the Dominican Republic says that the country is a presidential democratic republic. It is a republic because the chief of State is a president, and not a king, queen or emperor. It is presidential because the president is also the head of government and there is not a prime minister as in other countries. It is democratic because the president, vice-president and the members of Congress are elected by the people.\nNational government.\nThe Constitution also says that there are three branches of government with separation of powers. They are the \"executive branch\", the \"legislative branch\", and the \"judicial branch\". The three branches are independent from each other.\nExecutive branch.\nThe executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law. The people elects a President (and a Vice-President) who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the Armed Forces. The President decides whether or not the bills that the Legislative branch passes will become laws. He may also make \"decrees\" to govern the country and to name persons in different positions. The President is in charge of many departments that control all of the different parts of the government. These departments are called Secretaries of State because they help the President to govern the country. For example, the Secretary of State of Agriculture takes care of the agriculture of the country. The President may serve two 4-year terms, making 8 years in all.\nLegislative branch.\nThe legislative branch is the part of the government that makes laws. The legislative branch is made up of Congress, which is located in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. The Congress is divided into two groups or \"chambers\".\nOne group is the Chamber of Deputies (\"C\u00E1mara de Diputados\"). The Chamber of Deputies is made up of Deputies, who are each elected by voters from their own province. The number of Deputies a province has is based on how many people live there: the more people a province has, the more deputies it gets. No province can have less than two Deputies. Deputies serve 4-year terms. The total number of Deputies for the period 2006-2010 is 178.\nThe other house is the Senate (\"Senado\"). In the Senate, each province is represented equally, by one Senator. Senators serve 4-year terms. There are 32 Senators, one for every province and one for the National District, where the capital city is.\nJudicial branch.\nThe judicial branch is the part of government makes sure that the laws are obeyed and interprets what the law means. The judicial branch is made up of the Supreme Court and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution, then it is not a law anymore. The Supreme Court is made up of at least 11 judges. The head of the Supreme Court is called the President of the Supreme Court. A Supreme Court Justice serves until he or she either dies, or resigns (quits in the middle of his or her term). The Supreme Court controls all the courts in the country.\nProvincial and municipal government.\nThere is a governor in every province; there is not a governor in the National District, where is the capital of the country. The governors are only representatives of the President of the Republic.\nEvery province is divided into two or more municipalities (Spanish: \"municipios\", singular \"municipio\"); the Distrito Nacional has only one municipality - Santo Domingo.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are only two branches in the municipalities: the executive and the legislative. They are elected for four years by the people that lives in the municipality.\nThe Mayor (\"S\u00EDndico\") is the head of the executive branch and the Municipal Council (\"Ayuntamiento\") is the legislative branch.\nThe rural parts of a municipality are divided into \"Secciones\" (singular, \"Secci\u00F3n\"; in English, \"section\"); every \"Secci\u00F3n\" has a person which represents the municipal administration.\nThe Dominican Republic has 154 municipalities (\"municipios\") (June 20 2006).\nMunicipal districts.\nA municipality can have one municipal district (\"distrito municipal\") or more. A municipal council (\"Junta Municipal\") for such a municipal district is elected by the municipal council of the municipality to which it belongs and not for the people that lives there.\nThere are 202 municipal districts (\"distrito municipal\") in the Dominican Republic (June 20 2006).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":24},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":94},{"uri":"Separation_of_powers","surface_form":"separation of powers","offset":534},{"uri":"Santo_Domingo","surface_form":"Santo Domingo","offset":1648},{"uri":"Provinces_of_the_Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"province","offset":3124},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":3197},{"uri":"Distrito_Nacional","surface_form":"Distrito Nacional","offset":3403},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":3434},{"uri":"Santo_Domingo","surface_form":"Santo Domingo","offset":3449},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":3515},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":3630},{"uri":"Rural","surface_form":"rural","offset":3776},{"uri":"June_20","surface_form":"June 20","offset":4019},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":4027},{"uri":"June_20","surface_form":"June 20","offset":4405},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":4413}]}
