The water flows from higher land, then it falls down a big step of rock to lower land of softer rock where it will continue on its journey. Usually the lower land is in a gorge. Waterfalls are usually made when a river is young, in places where softer rock is underneath harder rock| in the waterfalls\nMany people choose them as sacred spots. The roar from a big waterfall is very loud. Some people think it is beautiful music and that a waterfall is one of the most beautiful things in nature.\nThe highest waterfall in the world is \"Angel Falls\" in Venezuela where the water falls.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":233},{"uri":"Sacred","surface_form":"sacred","offset":391},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":549},{"uri":"Angel_Falls","surface_form":"Angel Falls","offset":596},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":612}]}
