{"id":709599,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteriovenous_malformation","text":"A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cerebral AVM, CAVM, cAVM) is a rare connection between the arteries and veins in the brain. It is an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum.\nIn serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain (intracranial hemorrhage). Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom.\nThe most problems related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures, cranial nerve deficits, backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Artery","surface_form":"arteries","offset":98},{"uri":"Vein","surface_form":"vein","offset":111},{"uri":"Human_brain","surface_form":"brain","offset":124},{"uri":"Arteriovenous_malformation","surface_form":"arteriovenous malformation","offset":140},{"uri":"Cerebrum","surface_form":"cerebrum","offset":174},{"uri":"Intracranial_hemorrhage","surface_form":"intracranial hemorrhage","offset":268},{"uri":"Headache","surface_form":"headache","offset":422},{"uri":"Seizure","surface_form":"seizure","offset":436}]}
