{"id":709617,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazil_wildfires","text":"The 2019 Brazil wildfires is the result of at least 75,336 wildfires occurred in the country since January 2019.\nAs of August 20, there are fires burning in the Amazon rainforest in four Brazilian states: Amazonas, Rond\u00F4nia, Mato Grosso and Par\u00E1. At least 39,194 fires have been detected in Amazonas, which is the largest state in Brazil by area, and which has the \"largest standing tracts of unbroken rainforest\" in the world.\nA state of emergency was declared by the government of Amazonas on August 11.\nThe federal government and President Jair Bolsonaro claims that the data on the numbers are \"fake\" and refuses to help end the fires or allow other countries to help.\nIn August, Bolsonaro said no one was allowed to set fires in the Amazon for 60 days. When someone wants to change rainforest land into a farm or other thing, first they cut down the trees and leave them there. Then they allow the land to dry. Then they set it on fire. So many of the trees were still killed because people could cut them down and wait to burn them until later.\nWildfires were also a problem on the Cerrado grassland, a place with many rare plants and animals. 40% of its animals do not live in any other place on Earth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amazon_rainforest","surface_form":"Amazon rainforest","offset":161},{"uri":"Amazonas_(Brazil)","surface_form":"Amazonas","offset":205},{"uri":"Rond%C3%B4nia","surface_form":"Rond\u00F4nia","offset":215},{"uri":"Mato_Grosso","surface_form":"Mato Grosso","offset":225},{"uri":"Par%C3%A1","surface_form":"Par\u00E1","offset":241},{"uri":"State_of_emergency","surface_form":"state of emergency","offset":430},{"uri":"President_of_Brazil","surface_form":"President","offset":533},{"uri":"Jair_Bolsonaro","surface_form":"Jair Bolsonaro","offset":543},{"uri":"Cerrado","surface_form":"Cerrado","offset":1088}]}
