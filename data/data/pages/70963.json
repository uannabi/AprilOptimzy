{"id":70963,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno","text":"The Ta\u00EDnos were an indigenous people that lived in the Americas before Columbus arrived there. They came from the Caribbean coast of South America. Around 1200 CE, they moved northward to the island chain of the Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles.\nWhen Christopher Columbus came to the Americas, the Ta\u00EDnos were living in the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico), and some islands of the northern Lesser Antilles. Their culture was different from the culture of the Arawak people (another indigenous group of South America). They were the first people that the Spanish met in the Americas.\nName.\nThe name Ta\u00EDno was given by Columbus. When he met some native men, they said \"Ta\u00EDno, Ta\u00EDno\", meaning \"We are good, noble\". Columbus thought that ta\u00EDno was the name of the people.\nRouse divides the Ta\u00EDnos into three main groups. One is the Classic Ta\u00EDno, from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. Another is the Western Ta\u00EDno or sub-Ta\u00EDno, from Jamaica, Cuba (except for the western tip of the island) and the Bahamas. The third is the Eastern Ta\u00EDno, from the Virgin Islands to Montserrat.\nThe Ta\u00EDnos of the Bahamas were known as the '\"Lucayan\". (At that time, the Bahamas were called the \"Lucayas\"). Lucayos were Ta\u00EDnos, but their culture was less developed. Archeologists call them \"sub-Ta\u00EDnos\".\nOrigins.\nThe Ta\u00EDnos' ancestors went from the center of the Amazon Basin to the Orinoco Valley. From there, they went through Guyana and Venezuela and got to the Caribbean islands.\nA different theory says that the Ta\u00EDnos' ancestors came from the Colombian Andes.\nThe Ta\u00EDno culture developed in the Greater Antilles.\nCulture and lifestyle.\nTa\u00EDno society was divided into two classes. There were the \"naborias\" (common people) and the \"nita\u00EDnos\" (nobles). Both classes were governed by chiefs known as \"caciques\". The caciques could be either male or female. There were also \"bohiques\" (medicine men).\nThe Ta\u00EDnos lived in villages called \"yucayeques\".. The villages in the Bahamas were the smallest. The Ta\u00EDnos built large round houses called caney, where several families lived. The cacique and his family lived in a rectangular house called bohio. People slept on cotton hammocks (\"hamacas\").\nThe Ta\u00EDnos often played a ball game called \"batos\". \"Batey\" was also the name of the place where they played and had dances. The cacique sat on a chair of wood called \"duho\", or \"dujo\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"indigenous","offset":19},{"uri":"Pre-Columbian","surface_form":"before Columbus arrived there","offset":64},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":114},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":133},{"uri":"Common_Era","surface_form":"CE","offset":160},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":212},{"uri":"Greater_Antilles","surface_form":"Greater Antilles","offset":236},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":259},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":292},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":332},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":363},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":369},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":378},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":393},{"uri":"Arawak_people","surface_form":"Arawak people","offset":509},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":604},{"uri":"Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"Virgin Islands","offset":1089},{"uri":"Montserrat","surface_form":"Montserrat","offset":1107},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1261},{"uri":"Archeology","surface_form":"Archeologists","offset":1289},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":1348},{"uri":"Amazon_Basin","surface_form":"Amazon Basin","offset":1386},{"uri":"Orinoco","surface_form":"Orinoco","offset":1406},{"uri":"Guyana","surface_form":"Guyana","offset":1452},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":1463},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theory","offset":1519},{"uri":"Colombia","surface_form":"Colombia","offset":1572},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":1582},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"classes","offset":1700},{"uri":"Medicine_man","surface_form":"medicine men","offset":1911},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":1946},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"round","offset":2047},{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangular","offset":2142},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":2190},{"uri":"Hammock","surface_form":"hammock","offset":2197}]}
