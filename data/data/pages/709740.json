{"id":709740,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hamilton Howard \"Albert\" Fish (May 19, 1870 \u2013 January 16, 1936) was an American serial killer, child rapist and cannibal. He was also known as the Gray Man, the Werewolf of Wysteria, the Brooklyn Vampire, the Moon Maniac, and The Boogey Man. Fish once boasted that he \"had children in every state\", and at one time stated his number of victims was about 100. However, it is not known whether he was referring to rapes or cannibalization, nor is it known if the statement was truthful. Fish was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime. Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide, and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people. He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by electric chair at Sing Sing. His last words were, \"I don't even know why I'm here.\"\nFish was known to stab himself with pins, as could be seen from X-rays. He was also known to eat his own feces. Fish supposedly ate the penis of at least one of his victims.\nDue to modus operandi, his crimes were sometimes confused with those of nearby serial killer Peter Kudzinowski.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peter_Kudzinowski","surface_form":"Peter Kudzinowski","offset":1153}]}
