{"id":709745,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar","text":"A vertical bar is the glyph \"|\". It has several other names besides vertical bar, such as \"pipe\", \"vertical slash\", and \"bar\". In mathematics, it may be put on both sides of a real or complex number to mean its absolute value. When applied on both sides of a matrix, it means its determinant. When placed in between two numbers, it means the divisibility relation (for example. formula_1 means \"a\" divides \"b\").\nIn mathematics, double vertical bars are also used to refer to various mathematical concepts. These include the parallel relation (as in formula_1) and the norm of a vector (as in formula_1).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Glyph","surface_form":"glyph","offset":22},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":130},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real","offset":176},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex number","offset":184},{"uri":"Absolute_value","surface_form":"absolute value","offset":211},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"matrix","offset":259},{"uri":"Determinant","surface_form":"determinant","offset":280},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"divides","offset":398},{"uri":"Parallel_(geometry)","surface_form":"parallel relation","offset":524},{"uri":"Norm_(mathematics)","surface_form":"norm","offset":568},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":578}]}
