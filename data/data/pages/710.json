{"id":710,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage","text":"Sausage is a food made of ground-up or chopped-up meat. It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing. Traditionally, a sausage casing is made of animal intestine, but can sometimes be made of plastic. There are many forms of sausages, including hot dog, pepperoni, bologna, and salami.\nSausages often have meat from the animal's head, lips, cheeks, ears and other parts. Some have blood in them. Irish and English sausages normally have a lot of \"rusk,\" or bread crumbs, and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries. Vegetarian or vegan sausages are often made of products other than animal products, such as tofu.\nSausages may be used as a meal, in a sandwich, or in other foods like stews. Sausages can be eaten as whole pieces, or they can be chopped up as already cooked pieces.\nMany countries and regions have special kinds of sausage. Sausages are some of the oldest foods.\nName origin.\nThe word \"sausage\" was first used in English in the mid-15th century. During the mid-15th century, the word \"sausage\" was spelled as \"sawsyge\". The word \"sawsyge\" came from Old North French \"saussiche\" (Modern French \"saucisse\")\". The French word came from Vulgar Latin \"salsica\" (sausage), from \"salsicus\" (seasoned with salt).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Intestine","surface_form":"intestine","offset":160},{"uri":"Hot_dog","surface_form":"hot dog","offset":253},{"uri":"Pepperoni","surface_form":"pepperoni","offset":262},{"uri":"Bologna","surface_form":"bologna","offset":273},{"uri":"Salami","surface_form":"salami","offset":286},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":404},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":414},{"uri":"Tofu","surface_form":"tofu","offset":631},{"uri":"Sandwich","surface_form":"sandwich","offset":674},{"uri":"Stew","surface_form":"stew","offset":707},{"uri":"Vulgar_Latin","surface_form":"Vulgar Latin","offset":1172}]}
