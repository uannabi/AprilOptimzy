The term \"welfare queen\" originates from media reporting in 1974 and again when Ronald Reagan used the term to describe Linda Taylor during his 1976 campaign.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slur","surface_form":"slur","offset":33},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":50},{"uri":"Welfare","surface_form":"welfare","offset":120},{"uri":"Welfare_fraud","surface_form":"welfare fraud","offset":202},{"uri":"Readers_Digest","surface_form":"Readers Digest","offset":295},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":392},{"uri":"Linda_Taylor","surface_form":"Linda Taylor","offset":432}]}
