This may be done for creativity, advertising, or humor.\nThese are many brands with sensational spelling, including Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (which should be spelled \"crispy cream\"), Froot Loops (fruit loops), Mortal Kombat (mortal combat) and Hasbro's Playskool (playschool). It can also happen with common nouns, such as drive-thru (drive through), blu-ray (blue ray) \"lite\" items (light).\nSome websites on the internet also gain fame from sensational spelling, such as Google, flickr, Tumblr.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Krispy_Kreme","surface_form":"Krispy Kreme Doughnuts","offset":180},{"uri":"Froot_Loops","surface_form":"Froot Loops","offset":245},{"uri":"Mortal_Kombat_series","surface_form":"Mortal Kombat","offset":272},{"uri":"Hasbro","surface_form":"Hasbro's","offset":306},{"uri":"Playskool","surface_form":"Playskool","offset":315},{"uri":"Drive-thru","surface_form":"drive-thru","offset":385},{"uri":"Blu-ray","surface_form":"blu-ray","offset":413},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":534},{"uri":"Flickr","surface_form":"flickr","offset":542},{"uri":"Tumblr","surface_form":"Tumblr","offset":550}]}
