{"id":710394,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_language","text":"Dalmatian was a Romance language, which was spoken in Dalmatia, on the Eastern Adriatic Sea. The language became extinct in the Middle Ages. In places it was used until the 18th or 19th century. Today, few sources are left. Only the dialect of Veglia (Krk) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) have enough sources so they can be studied. From the other dialects, there are only isloate words, or short phrases.\nIn 1897, the scholar Matteo Bartoli, himself a native of nearby Istria, visited postman Tuone Udaina (), nicknamed \"burbur\" ('barber' in Dalmatian) the last known speaker of any Dalmatian dialect, to study his language. Bartoli wrote down approximately 2,800 words, stories, and accounts of his life, which were published in a book in German (') in 1906. That book has provided much information on the vocabulary, phonology, and grammar of the language.\nOne year after the interview, on 10 June 1898, Tuone Udaina was accidentally killed at 74 in a roadwork explosion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dalmatia","surface_form":"Dalmatia","offset":54},{"uri":"Adriatic_Sea","surface_form":"Adriatic Sea","offset":79},{"uri":"Matteo_Bartoli","surface_form":"Matteo Bartoli","offset":418},{"uri":"Istria","surface_form":"Istria","offset":461},{"uri":"Tuone_Udaina","surface_form":"Tuone Udaina","offset":485},{"uri":"Tuone_Udaina","surface_form":"Tuone Udaina","offset":898}]}
