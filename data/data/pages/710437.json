The fourth named storm, second hurricane, first major hurricane, and a first Category 5 hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season.\nOn August 30, Dorian became a first major hurricane of the season, and then became a Category 4 hurricane from a Category 2 in 9 hours. Dorian later became a Category 5 hurricane, making 2019 the fourth consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane (Matthew in 2016, Irma and Maria in 2017, and Michael in 2018). The storm was the second most-intense storm to strike anywhere in the Atlantic basin.\nDorian struck the northwestern Bahamas with 185 mph sustained winds and heavy flooding. This was the most powerful tropical cyclone on the record to hit the Bahamas, and is regarded as the worst natural disaster in the country's history.\nThe cyclone brushed eastern Florida and Georgia. The storm was also expected to move over northeastern South Carolina, eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. After that, it transitioned into a category 2 extratropical storm and hit Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.\nTropical cyclone warnings and watches were put up for areas from the Leeward Islands to Hispaniola. Similar warnings were put up from Florida to Delaware.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":28},{"uri":"British_Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"British","offset":64},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":76},{"uri":"Virgin_Islands","surface_form":"Virgin Islands","offset":90},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":120},{"uri":"2019_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2019 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":238},{"uri":"Hurricane_Matthew","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":538},{"uri":"2016_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2016","offset":549},{"uri":"Hurricane_Irma","surface_form":"Irma","offset":555},{"uri":"Hurricane_Maria","surface_form":"Maria","offset":564},{"uri":"2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2017","offset":573},{"uri":"Hurricane_Michael","surface_form":"Michael","offset":583},{"uri":"2018_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2018","offset":594},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic basin","offset":671},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":718},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flooding","offset":765},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":953},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":965},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":1028},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":1052},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":1084},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":1168},{"uri":"Newfoundland_and_Labrador","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":1184},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches","surface_form":"Tropical cyclone warnings and watches","offset":1198},{"uri":"Leeward_Islands","surface_form":"Leeward Islands","offset":1267},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":1286},{"uri":"Delaware","surface_form":"Delaware","offset":1343}]}
