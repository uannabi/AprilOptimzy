{"id":710542,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Technical_Institute","text":"Sega Technical Institute (STI) was an American development division of Sega. It was created by Mark Cerny in 1991. They wanted to combine good Japanese developers, including Sonic Team programmer Yuji Naka and his team, with new American developers. STI created many \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" games, as well as other games for the Sega Genesis. It closed in late 1996.\nGames developed by STI are important in the history of the Genesis, and many were well-received or sold well. Developers have described STI as a unique workplace that did not fit into Sega's corporate structure, and have fond memories of the environment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game_developer","surface_form":"development","offset":47},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":71},{"uri":"Mark_Cerny","surface_form":"Mark Cerny","offset":95},{"uri":"Sonic_Team","surface_form":"Sonic Team","offset":174},{"uri":"Yuji_Naka","surface_form":"Yuji Naka","offset":196},{"uri":"Sonic_the_Hedgehog","surface_form":"Sonic the Hedgehog","offset":268},{"uri":"Sega_Genesis","surface_form":"Sega Genesis","offset":326}]}
