{"id":710756,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)","text":"Electoral districts in Canada (also called a \"constituency\" or \"riding\") are what Canada's representative democracy is based on. In Canadian French, it is called a \"circonscription\", but is also called a \"comt\u00E9\" (county). Every single federal electoral district is represented by one Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada. In provincial or territorial electoral districts, the person that represents the riding might be called a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Member of the National Assembly (NLA), Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP), or a Member of the House of Assembly (MHA).\nRight now, federal and provincial electoral districts are only represented by one person. In the past, however, some have been represented by more than one person.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":82},{"uri":"Representative_democracy","surface_form":"representative democracy","offset":91},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":284},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_Canada","surface_form":"House of Commons of Canada","offset":317},{"uri":"Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","surface_form":"provincial or territorial","offset":348},{"uri":"Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly","surface_form":"represents the riding","offset":411}]}
