{"id":71107,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)","text":"\"Chuck\" is an American television series that started on the NBC network on September 24, 2007 and ended on January 27, 2012.\nThe series is about Chuck Bartowski, a normal guy who fixes computers at the Buy More store in Burbank, California, as part of the \"Nerd Herd\". His old friend Bryce turns out to be a rogue spy. Just before he dies, Bryce sends Chuck an e-mail with thousands of pictures. The pictures are encoded with all of the nation's spy secrets. After viewing them, Chuck holds all of the secrets inside his head (with his flashes as the intersect).\nChuck is watched by agents from the CIA and the NSA, who hope to use Chuck's secrets to protect the United States from terrorism.\nThe humor elements of the show involve a satire of the Best Buy chain of electronics stores. The show wanted to use \"Geek Squad\" to describe the main characters' job. But Best Buy asked for them to change the name. So the characters on \"Chuck\" were called \"Nerd Herd\" instead. In fact, the exterior shots of the Burbank Buy More store where Chuck and Morgan work are a former Mervyn's store in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":14},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":23},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":61},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"network","offset":65},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":186},{"uri":"Burbank%2C_California","surface_form":"Burbank, California","offset":221},{"uri":"Secret_agent","surface_form":"spy","offset":315},{"uri":"E-mail","surface_form":"e-mail","offset":362},{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":387},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"nation's","offset":438},{"uri":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","surface_form":"CIA","offset":600},{"uri":"National_Security_Agency","surface_form":"NSA","offset":612},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":683},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satire","offset":735},{"uri":"Best_Buy","surface_form":"Best Buy","offset":749},{"uri":"Mervyn%27s","surface_form":"Mervyn's","offset":1070},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Canoga Park, California","offset":1110}]}
