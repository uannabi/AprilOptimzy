{"id":711166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki","text":"Anwar al-Awlaki (also spelled al-Aulaqi, al-Awlaqi; \"Anwar al-\u2018Awlaq\u012B\"; April 21/22, 1971\u00A0\u2013 September 30, 2011) was a Yemeni-American imam. He was a known recruiter and motivational speaker representing al-Qaeda.\nAl-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike without the rights of due process. President Barack Obama ordered the strike.\nOn January 29, 2017, al-Awlaki's 8-year-old daughter, Nawar Al-Awlaki, was killed in a U.S. commando attack in Yemen that was ordered by President Donald Trump. He was known as the \"bin Laden of the Internet\" for positing pro al-Qaeda speeches on the internet.\nAfter a request from the U.S. Congress, in November 2010, Google removed many of al-Awlaki's videos from its websites. According to \"The New York Times\", al-Awlaki's public statements and videos have been more influential in inspiring acts of terrorism after his killing than before his death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":125},{"uri":"Imam","surface_form":"imam","offset":134},{"uri":"Al-Qaeda","surface_form":"al-Qaeda","offset":203},{"uri":"Drone_strike","surface_form":"drone strike","offset":289},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":347},{"uri":"Raid_on_Yakla","surface_form":"U.S. commando attack in Yemen","offset":467},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":527},{"uri":"Osama_bin_Laden","surface_form":"bin Laden","offset":562},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":699},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":774},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":884}]}
