He was one of the main workers to the development of Garside methods in group theory.\nHis works helped solved the word problem of general Artin\u2013Tits groups.\nDehornoy died on September 4, 2019 in Caen, France at the age of 66.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"University_of_Caen","surface_form":"University of Caen","offset":103},{"uri":"Large_cardinal","surface_form":"large cardinal","offset":165},{"uri":"Dehornoy_order","surface_form":"Dehornoy order","offset":213},{"uri":"Braid_group","surface_form":"braid group","offset":236},{"uri":"Garside_element","surface_form":"Garside methods","offset":302},{"uri":"Word_problem_for_groups","surface_form":"word problem","offset":363},{"uri":"Artin-Tits_group","surface_form":"Artin\u2013Tits group","offset":387},{"uri":"Caen","surface_form":"Caen","offset":444}]}
