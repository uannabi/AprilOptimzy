He was born into a family of four girls and three boys and grew up enjoying the clear waters surrounding La Isla Bonita. When he was a child, Heredia went canoeing out to the sea, fishing and snorkeling in Caribbean Sea. Those were his favourite activities to do in his past time.\nFor his Primary education, Heredia attended San Pedro Roman Catholic School, now known as the San Pedro police station. He studied there from 1961 to 1966, he was appointed as a Student Councillor in 1962 and served in that role until he graduated. The two story wooden building provided him with a sound education. On Reconition Day he was awarded the \u201CMost Compassionate Student\u201D and \u201DMost Contributive Student\u201D Award. After successfully completing his studies there he attended Saint John\u2019s College High School (SJCHS) for his Secondary education in Belize City and studied there from 1967 to 1970. Heredia\u2019s entire family made the move to the the City. At SJCHS, Heredia studied Industrial Arts in 1969 and 1970 and was specialised in Welding.

He proudly graduated in 1970, winning four awards.\nAfter graduating, Heredia moved back to the island and began fishing with his Uncle, Francisco Arceo. Arceo was the Father of Heredia\u2019s Cousin and Long-time rival Patty Arceo. Arceo and Heredia fished for four months, until he heard of a great opportunity in Landyville in the Mainland. Bowen and Brown Distributers were planning to build their beer (Belikin) Factory and were in need of welders. Since he had majored in Welding, Heredia decided to take advantage of the opportunity and made the move to the Mainland where he remained for 14 months. With the ball in his court, Heredia along with others struggled to weld but in the end they manage to complete the project in time. After the project\u2019s completion, the manager of the Factory offered Him a job as a Maintainace worker but Heredia chose to move back to San Pedro Town.\nHe returned to the Island In January 1972 and opened his own Welding shop on Prescador Drive and eventually became the manager of that shop. Due to his stellar experience in the Fishing industry, Heredia was appointed as the Director of the Caribe\u00F1a Cooperative which he served for 30 years, he still had his passion for the open sea and went out on fishing trips with Guillermo Nunez and/or Severo Castillo at least once a week their catches were then sold to the Cooperative.\nOn 25 November 1975, only one short month after The Lions Club was formed in San Pedro Town.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"San_Pedro_Town","surface_form":"San Pedro Town","offset":62},{"uri":"Belizean","surface_form":"Belizean","offset":83},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":92},{"uri":"Belize_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"Belize House of Representatives","offset":126},{"uri":"Belize_Rural_South","surface_form":"Belize Rural South","offset":162},{"uri":"Minister_of_Tourism","surface_form":"Minister of Tourism","offset":216},{"uri":"Minister_of_Civil_Aviation","surface_form":"Minister of Civil Aviation","offset":303},{"uri":"Minister_of_Tourism","surface_form":"Minister of Tourism","offset":456},{"uri":"Minister_of_Culture","surface_form":"Minister of Culture","offset":480},{"uri":"Minister_of_Culture","surface_form":"Minister of Culture","offset":514},{"uri":"Minister_of_Civil_Aviation","surface_form":"Minister of Civil Aviation","offset":639},{"uri":"San_Pedro_Town","surface_form":"San Pedro Town","offset":739},{"uri":"La_Isla_Bonita","surface_form":"La Isla Bonita","offset":900},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":1001},{"uri":"Primary_education","surface_form":"Primary education","offset":1084},{"uri":"San_Pedro_Roman_Catholic_School","surface_form":"San Pedro Roman Catholic School","offset":1120},{"uri":"San_Pedro_police_station","surface_form":"San Pedro police station","offset":1170},{"uri":"Student_Councillor","surface_form":"Student Councillor","offset":1254},{"uri":"Reconition_Day","surface_form":"Reconition Day","offset":1395},{"uri":"Saint_John%E2%80%99s_College_High_School","surface_form":"Saint John\u2019s College High School","offset":1557},{"uri":"Secondary_education","surface_form":"Secondary education","offset":1606},{"uri":"Belize_City","surface_form":"Belize City","offset":1629},{"uri":"Industrial_Arts","surface_form":"Industrial Arts","offset":1759},{"uri":"Welding","surface_form":"Welding","offset":1815},{"uri":"Student_Councillor","surface_form":"Student Councillor","offset":1857},{"uri":"Student_Council_Executive_Committee","surface_form":"Student Council Executive Committee","offset":1941},{"uri":"Head_of_Games_and_Events","surface_form":"Head of Games and Events","offset":2018},{"uri":"Francisco_Arceo","surface_form":"Francisco Arceo","offset":2180},{"uri":"Patty_Arceo","surface_form":"Patty Arceo","offset":2258},{"uri":"Landyville","surface_form":"Landyville","offset":2354},{"uri":"Mainland","surface_form":"Mainland","offset":2372},{"uri":"Bowen_and_Brown_Distributers","surface_form":"Bowen and Brown Distributers","offset":2382},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"Factory","offset":2455},{"uri":"Welders","surface_form":"welders","offset":2483},{"uri":"Welding","surface_form":"Welding","offset":2516},{"uri":"Mainland","surface_form":"Mainland","offset":2603},{"uri":"Factory","surface_form":"Factory","offset":2828},{"uri":"Maintainace_worker","surface_form":"Maintainace worker","offset":2859},{"uri":"San_Pedro_Town","surface_form":"San Pedro Town","offset":2912},{"uri":"Welding_shop","surface_form":"Welding shop","offset":2989},{"uri":"Prescador_Drive","surface_form":"Prescador Drive","offset":3005},{"uri":"Fishing_industry","surface_form":"Fishing industry","offset":3106},{"uri":"Director_of_the_Caribe%C3%B1a_Cooperative","surface_form":"Director of the Caribe\u00F1a Cooperative","offset":3153},{"uri":"Guillermo_Nunez","surface_form":"Guillermo Nunez","offset":3297},{"uri":"Severo_Castillo","surface_form":"Severo Castillo","offset":3320},{"uri":"Cooperative","surface_form":"Cooperative","offset":3393},{"uri":"The_Lions_Club","surface_form":"The Lions Club","offset":3454},{"uri":"San_Pedro_Town","surface_form":"San Pedro Town","offset":3483}]}
