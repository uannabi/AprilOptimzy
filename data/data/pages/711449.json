He was fatally shot while seated in his own car after a live performance in Nakhon Pathom.\nBiography.\nBorn in Suphan Buri Province, he chose Suraphol as his stage name. His first hit came in 1954 with \"Nam Ta Sao Wieng\" (\"Tears of a Lao Girl\"). It marked the emergence of luk thung, a Thai counterpart to such crooning styles as Japanese enka and Indonesian kroncong, and embodied such influences as Hollywood film music, American country music, Malay pop and Afro-Cuban rhythms.\nEnjoying popularity at the same time as Elvis Presley and The Beatles, Suraphol was sometimes called the \"Thai Elvis\". By the 1960s, there was no Thai performer who was better known than Suraphol Sombatcharoen.\nSuraphol composed more than 100 songs. Among his best known are \"Sao Suan Taeng\" (\"The Girl from the Cucumber Field\"), \"Mong\" (\"Look\"), \"Nam Ta Ja Tho\" (\"The Tears of a Corporal\"), \"Khong Plom\" (\"Fake Stuff\"), and \"Muai Cham\" (\"Broken-Hearted Chinese Girl\").\nShortly before his murder, he released his last and most memorable song, \"Siphok Pi Haeng Khwam Lang\" (\"\u0E2A\u0E34\u0E1A\u0E2B\u0E01\u0E1B\u0E35\u0E41\u0E2B\u0E48\u0E07\u0E04\u0E27\u0E32\u0E21\u0E2B\u0E25\u0E31\u0E07\" or \"16 Years of Our Past\"), in which told sadly about the end of his own 16-year marriage, reflecting on both the happiness and bitterness of the union.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Elvis_Presley","surface_form":"Elvis Presley","offset":728},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":746}]}
