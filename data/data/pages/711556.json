{"id":711556,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization","text":"A cradle of civilization is a place where civilization emerged. There was no single \"cradle\", but several civilizations that developed independently. The Fertile Crescent (Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia), Ancient India, and Ancient China were the first. Whether there was influence between the early civilizations of the Near East and those of East Asia is not known.\nScholars accept that the civilizations of Mesoamerica emerged independently and later than those in Eurasia. They were mainly in modern Mexico, and Norte Chico, in the north-central coastal region of Peru.\nCivilization involves the use of writing, building cities, a class-based society, agriculture, animal husbandry, public buildings, metallurgy, and monumental architecture. The term \"cradle of civilization\" has been applied to a variety of cultures and areas, in particular the Ancient Near Eastern Chalcolithic and Fertile Crescent, Ancient India and Ancient China. It has also been applied to ancient Anatolia, the Levant and Iranian plateau, and used to refer to culture predecessors\u2014such as Ancient Greece as the predecessor of Western civilization.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Civilization","surface_form":"civilization","offset":42},{"uri":"Fertile_Crescent","surface_form":"Fertile Crescent","offset":154},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":172},{"uri":"Mesopotamia","surface_form":"Mesopotamia","offset":187},{"uri":"Ancient_India","surface_form":"Ancient India","offset":201},{"uri":"Ancient_China","surface_form":"Ancient China","offset":220},{"uri":"Near_East","surface_form":"Near East","offset":317},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":340},{"uri":"Mesoamerica","surface_form":"Mesoamerica","offset":406},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":464},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":500},{"uri":"Norte_Chico_civilization","surface_form":"Norte Chico","offset":512},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":564},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"writing","offset":603},{"uri":"Cities","surface_form":"cities","offset":621},{"uri":"Social_class","surface_form":"class","offset":631},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":643},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":652},{"uri":"Animal_husbandry","surface_form":"animal husbandry","offset":665},{"uri":"Metallurgy","surface_form":"metallurgy","offset":701},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":728},{"uri":"Ancient_Near_East","surface_form":"Ancient Near East","offset":847},{"uri":"Chalcolithic","surface_form":"Chalcolithic","offset":868},{"uri":"Fertile_Crescent","surface_form":"Fertile Crescent","offset":885},{"uri":"Ancient_India","surface_form":"Ancient India","offset":903},{"uri":"Ancient_China","surface_form":"Ancient China","offset":921},{"uri":"Anatolia","surface_form":"Anatolia","offset":972},{"uri":"Levant","surface_form":"Levant","offset":986},{"uri":"Iranian_plateau","surface_form":"Iranian plateau","offset":997},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":1064},{"uri":"Western_civilization","surface_form":"Western civilization","offset":1101}]}
