{"id":711557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86orkovac","text":"\u0106orkovac is an eastern confluent of the Vrbanja river in Bosnia. It begins on the north-eastern slopes of the Vla\u0161i\u0107 mountain's plateau, and the mouth opens at \u0160iprage, where the town's sawmill was. The spring of \u0106orkovac is 1,150 metres above sea level, and its length is around 6 kilometres. It flows between the Jasen and Stra\u017Ebenica mountains to its estuary. The watermills were in operation until the 1960s.\nIn the relatively narrow area there is a fertile and wide riverhead between \u0106orkovac, Ilomska, \u010Cudni\u0107, Kova\u010Devi\u0107a potok, Grabovi\u010Dka rijeka, Kobilja, Ugri\u0107 and other confluents of Vrbanja and the Ugar river.\nThe crest of the riverhead directs towards the villages of Petrovo Polje, Imljani, Vlatkovi\u0107i, and the Skender Vakuf Municipality.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["river"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":40},{"uri":"Bosnia","surface_form":"Bosnia","offset":57},{"uri":"Vla%C5%A1i%C4%87_(mountain)","surface_form":"Vla\u0161i\u0107","offset":110},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":160},{"uri":"Ilomska","surface_form":"Ilomska","offset":499},{"uri":"%C4%8Cudni%C4%87","surface_form":"\u010Cudni\u0107","offset":508},{"uri":"Kova%C4%8Devi%C4%87a_potok","surface_form":"Kova\u010Devi\u0107a potok","offset":516},{"uri":"Grabovi%C4%8Dka_rijeka","surface_form":"Grabovi\u010Dka rijeka","offset":534},{"uri":"Ugar_(river)","surface_form":"Ugar","offset":608},{"uri":"Imljani","surface_form":"Imljani","offset":694},{"uri":"Skender_Vakuf","surface_form":"Skender Vakuf","offset":723}]}
