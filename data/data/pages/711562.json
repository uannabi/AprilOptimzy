It is about three km long.\nSeveral of its constituent streams originate in the Guzovina - Vis elevation complex (1003 m), west of the village of Kova\u010Devi\u0107i: Tocil at 1000 m above sea level, Duboki potok (Deep creek) at 900 m, and nameless creek at 940 m. First, the Tocil and the Deep creek connect, and then that watercourse connects with the nameless creek between Durakovi\u0107i and Kovacevi\u0107i villages at an altitude of 672 m, on the road R-440: \u0160iprage - Kru\u0161evo Brdo\nFrom the \u010Cudni\u0107 basin and to the south, it is separated by Arab Hill. On this stream, in the 1960s, there were five watermills.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English","surface_form":"eng.","offset":18},{"uri":"Vrbanja_river","surface_form":"Vrbanja river","offset":67},{"uri":"Kru%C5%A1evo_Brdo","surface_form":"Kru\u0161evo Brdo","offset":90},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":118},{"uri":"Kotor-Varo%C5%A1","surface_form":"Kotor-Varo\u0161","offset":148},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":175},{"uri":"Priso%C4%8Dka","surface_form":"Durakovi\u0107i","offset":566},{"uri":"%C5%A0iprage","surface_form":"\u0160iprage","offset":645},{"uri":"Kru%C5%A1evo_Brdo","surface_form":"Kru\u0161evo Brdo","offset":655},{"uri":"%C4%8Cudni%C4%87","surface_form":"\u010Cudni\u0107","offset":677},{"uri":"Arab_Hill","surface_form":"Arab Hill","offset":727},{"uri":"Watermill","surface_form":"watermill","offset":784}]}
