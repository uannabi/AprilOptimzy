{"id":71182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterium","text":"A criterium, or crit, is a type of bicycle race held on a short course (usually less than 5\u00A0km), often run on closed-off city centre streets.\nRace length can be either a time or a number of laps. Often a criterium lasts about one hour, which is shorter than that of a traditional road race \u2013 which can last many hours, sometimes of several days or even weeks, as in a Grand Tour. However, the average speed and is much higher. The winner is the first rider to cross the finish line without having been \"lapped\" (overtaken).\nEvents often have prizes (called \"primes\", usually cash) for winning specific intermediate laps (for instance, every 10th lap).\nWinning criteriums needs a mix of good technical skills \u2013 especially the ability to corner rapidly and sharply \u2013 and riding safely with a large group on a short circuit and exceptional fitness to attack other riders and repeatedly accelerate hard from corners.\nCriteriums are relatively easy to organize and do not require a large amount of space. They are the most common type of bicycle racing in the continental United States.\nEquipment.\nRacing bicycles used for criteriums are typically no different than those used in other mass-start road events. However, some racers use shorter bicycles to help keep control when turning and slightly shorter cranks (pedal levers) to help pedalling through sharp turns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Road_bicycle_racing","surface_form":"bicycle race","offset":35},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"km","offset":92},{"uri":"Grand_Tour_(cycling)","surface_form":"Grand Tour","offset":368},{"uri":"Racing_bicycle","surface_form":"Racing bicycle","offset":1093},{"uri":"Crankset","surface_form":"cranks","offset":1302}]}
