{"id":71192,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_studio","text":"A movie studio, or film studio, is a place where movies are made. A movie studio can be an area where the movie is filmed; like an indoor (interior) stage or room, or an outdoor area in which only those making the movie are allowed to be.\nThe term \"movie studio\" also means a production company because these companies often had - in the 1920s to the 1940s - their own studios in their own buildings. Even though most production companies do not now have their own studios, the term is still used in this way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":49},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"filmed","offset":115},{"uri":"Stage_(theatre)","surface_form":"stage","offset":149},{"uri":"Production","surface_form":"production","offset":276},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":287},{"uri":"1920s","surface_form":"1920s","offset":338},{"uri":"1940s","surface_form":"1940s","offset":351},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":390}]}
