{"id":711932,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_64","text":"e=\"preserve\">Doom 64 is a video game that first came out only on the Nintendo 64, but can now be played on today's video game consoles. It is a direct sequel to Doom 2, making it the third part of the Doom story. This is ironic because the story of Doom 3 is not related to Doom or Doom 2, but it is a reboot, which means it is a new start to the Doom story.\nDoom 64 has all the same weapons and monsters from Doom 2, but it has a few more new types of monsters and a new weapon, the Unmaker. The weapons and monsters look a little different from the earlier games, but there are fewer differences than in Doom 3. Other than the new graphics and new weapon, the gameplay was not much different from the earlier Doom games. It came out in 1997, but the game did not sell well because many popular FPS games came out that same year, including GoldenEye 007, Quake II, and. However, the game does have a cult following and fans had made unlicensed mods on the PC and other video game consoles. Due to its popularity, Bethesda announced during Nintendo Direct 2019 that it would sell the game digitally on the Nintendo Switch on November 22, 2019. It will be the same game, but the lighting of the game will be fixed, which was a major criticism of the N64 version of the game.\nId Software released Doom 64 digitally the same day as Doom Eternal, the sequel to Doom (2016).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":26},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":69},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game consoles","offset":115},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"direct sequel","offset":144},{"uri":"Doom_2","surface_form":"Doom 2","offset":161},{"uri":"Irony","surface_form":"ironic","offset":221},{"uri":"Doom_3","surface_form":"Doom 3","offset":249},{"uri":"Doom","surface_form":"Doom","offset":274},{"uri":"Reboot_(fiction)","surface_form":"reboot","offset":302},{"uri":"Monster","surface_form":"monsters","offset":453},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":472},{"uri":"First-person_shooter","surface_form":"FPS","offset":796},{"uri":"GoldenEye_007","surface_form":"GoldenEye 007","offset":841},{"uri":"Quake_II","surface_form":"Quake II","offset":856},{"uri":"Cult_following","surface_form":"cult following","offset":901},{"uri":"Mod_(video_gaming)","surface_form":"mods","offset":945},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game consoles","offset":970},{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popularity","offset":1002},{"uri":"Bethesda_Softworks","surface_form":"Bethesda","offset":1014},{"uri":"Nintendo_Direct","surface_form":"Nintendo Direct 2019","offset":1040},{"uri":"DLC","surface_form":"digitally","offset":1089},{"uri":"Nintendo_Switch","surface_form":"Nintendo Switch","offset":1106},{"uri":"Lighting","surface_form":"lighting","offset":1178},{"uri":"Criticism","surface_form":"criticism","offset":1232},{"uri":"Id_Software","surface_form":"Id Software","offset":1274},{"uri":"Doom_Eternal","surface_form":"Doom Eternal","offset":1329},{"uri":"Doom_(2016_video_game)","surface_form":"Doom (2016)","offset":1357}]}
