It is organised by the \"Le Dauphin\u00E9 Lib\u00E9r\u00E9\" newspaper. Along with the Tour de Suisse, the Dauphin\u00E9 Lib\u00E9r\u00E9 is an important race in the lead-up to the Tour de France in July.\nBecause the Dauphin\u00E9 is a mountainous area, the winners are often climbing specialists. Many climbs that are famous from the Tour de France, like the Mont Ventoux, the Col du Galibier or \"Col de la Chartreuse\" appear often in the Dauphin\u00E9 Lib\u00E9r\u00E9.\nAll cyclists who have won the Tour de France five times or more have also won the Dauphin\u00E9 Lib\u00E9r\u00E9.\nThe first Dauphin\u00E9 Lib\u00E9r\u00E9 was held in 1947 when Eduard Klablinski from Poland was the winner. Nello Lauredi, Luis Oca\u00F1a, Charly Mottet and Bernard Hinault share the record of the most wins, with three each.\nIban Mayo won in 2004, when he climbed Mont Ventoux very quickly. In the 2005 Dauphin\u00E9 the winner was I\u00F1igo Landaluze, of the Euskaltel-Euskadi team.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Cycling race"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Criterium","surface_form":"Criterium","offset":48},{"uri":"Cycling","surface_form":"cycling","offset":105},{"uri":"Road_bicycle_racing","surface_form":"road race","offset":113},{"uri":"Dauphin%C3%A9","surface_form":"Dauphin\u00E9","offset":153},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":172},{"uri":"Tour_de_Suisse","surface_form":"Tour de Suisse","offset":280},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":359},{"uri":"Climbing_specialist_(cycling)","surface_form":"climbing specialists","offset":449},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":508},{"uri":"Mont_Ventoux","surface_form":"Mont Ventoux","offset":533},{"uri":"Col_du_Galibier","surface_form":"Col du Galibier","offset":551},{"uri":"Eduard_Klablinski","surface_form":"Eduard Klablinski","offset":777},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":800},{"uri":"Nello_Lauredi","surface_form":"Nello Lauredi","offset":823},{"uri":"Luis_Oca%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Luis Oca\u00F1a","offset":838},{"uri":"Charly_Mottet","surface_form":"Charly Mottet","offset":850},{"uri":"Bernard_Hinault","surface_form":"Bernard Hinault","offset":868},{"uri":"Iban_Mayo","surface_form":"Iban Mayo","offset":936},{"uri":"Mont_Ventoux","surface_form":"Mont Ventoux","offset":975},{"uri":"2005_Crit%C3%A9rium_du_Dauphin%C3%A9_Lib%C3%A9r%C3%A9","surface_form":"2005 Dauphin\u00E9","offset":1009},{"uri":"I%C3%B1igo_Landaluze","surface_form":"I\u00F1igo Landaluze","offset":1038},{"uri":"Euskaltel-Euskadi","surface_form":"Euskaltel-Euskadi","offset":1062}]}
