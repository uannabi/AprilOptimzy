{"id":711998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_election","text":"=\"preserve\">A writ of election is a writ [rit/] issued ordering the holding of an election.\nIn Canada, a writ is the \"only\" way of holding an election for the House of Commons. When the Government wants to or is required to dissolve Parliament, a writ of election is drawn up for each riding in Canada by the Chief Electoral Officer. They are then formally issued by the Governor General.\nWhere a single seat becomes vacant, a writ is also issued to trigger the by-election for that seat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_Canada","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":159},{"uri":"Government_of_Canada","surface_form":"Government","offset":186},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Canada","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":233},{"uri":"Governor_General_of_Canada","surface_form":"Governor General","offset":371},{"uri":"By-election","surface_form":"by-election","offset":462}]}
