{"id":71214,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter","text":"In baseball, a designated hitter (DH) is a person who bats in place of the pitcher in the American League of Major League Baseball. In the National League, the pitchers have to bat for themselves. The designated hitter is usually one of the best hitters on the team but is not a good defensive player.\nThe reason for the designated hitter is because many pitchers are not good hitters. Pitchers are chosen because they are good at pitching, not because they are good at hitting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":3},{"uri":"Baseball_bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":54},{"uri":"Pitcher_(baseball)","surface_form":"pitcher","offset":75},{"uri":"American_League","surface_form":"American League","offset":90},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":109},{"uri":"National_League","surface_form":"National League","offset":139},{"uri":"Defense_(sports)","surface_form":"defensive","offset":284}]}
