It is named after its originator, the physicist Max Born. The Born rule is one of the key principles of quantum mechanics.\nIt gives the probability that a measurement on a quantum system will yield a predicted result.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum mechanics","offset":91},{"uri":"Max_Born","surface_form":"Max Born","offset":158},{"uri":"Probability","surface_form":"probability","offset":246},{"uri":"Quantum_system","surface_form":"quantum system","offset":282}]}
