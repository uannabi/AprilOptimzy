{"id":713228,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions","text":"In cases of diseases and/or disorders.\nExecutive functions are primarily controlled from a part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which relies on a regulated, adequate supply of dopamine. In cases of addiction, ADHD, autism, and other nervous-system disorders, it is possible for this part of the brain to only receive a portion of the dopamine that it needs in order to work at full capacity. As a result an individual can lose partial or even complete control of these mental abilities. It is possible that by increasing dopamine production in the brain by medication, exercise, or a variety of other methods, the prefrontal cortex can receive additional dopamine, and the person can regain control of some or all of these functions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
