{"id":71329,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Martyr_d%27Anghiera","text":"e=\"preserve\">Peter Martyr d'Anghiera (2 February 1457 \u2013 October 1526) was an Italian-born historian of Spain and of the discoveries and explorations in the Americas.\nHe was born on February 2, 1457 at Arona, near Anghiera (called now Angera) on Lake Maggiore, Lombardy, Italy. He went to Rome in 1477, at the age of twenty, and there he met important persons of the Catholic Church. In 1486, Anghiera met the Spanish ambassador in Rome, and with him to Spain in August, 1487, to the court of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella of Castile.\nHe wrote in Latin the first accounts of explorations in the Americas in a series of letters and reports that were published from 1511 to 1530 in chapters called \"Decades\". The first three \"Decades\", together with a description of his experiences in Egypt, were published in 1516 under the title: \"De orbe novo decades cum Legatione Babylonica\" or, for short, \"De orbe novo\" (\"On the New World\").\nHe was the first writer to use the word \"Hispaniola\" to name the island that Columbus named \"La Espa\u00F1ola\". He also wrote that the Ta\u00EDno name of the island was \"Quizqueia\", a name that no other historian of that time mentioned. Quizqueia is used now as \"Quisqueya\" or \"Kiskeya\" for the whole island (in Haiti) or for the eastern part (in the Dominican Republic).\nHe died in October 1526 at Granada, Spain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":77},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"historian","offset":90},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":103},{"uri":"The_Americas","surface_form":"the Americas","offset":152},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":288},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":366},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":431},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":453},{"uri":"Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon","surface_form":"Ferdinand II of Aragon","offset":492},{"uri":"Isabella_of_Castile","surface_form":"Isabella of Castile","offset":519},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":552},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":789},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":977},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":1001},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Columbus","offset":1013},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":1066},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":1238},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":1277},{"uri":"Granada","surface_form":"Granada","offset":1325},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1334}]}
