{"id":7133,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi-Yau_manifold","text":"A Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, or 'Calabi\u2013Yau space', is a special type of manifold. It is described in certain branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry.\nThe Calabi\u2013Yau manifold's properties, such as Ricci flatness, have applications in theoretical physics. Particularly in superstring theory, the extra dimensions of spacetime might take the form of a 6-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold. This led to the idea of string theory mirror symmetry.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manifold","surface_form":"manifold","offset":67},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":116},{"uri":"Algebraic_geometry","surface_form":"algebraic geometry","offset":136},{"uri":"Ricci_flat","surface_form":"Ricci flat","offset":202},{"uri":"Theoretical_physics","surface_form":"theoretical physics","offset":239},{"uri":"Superstring_theory","surface_form":"superstring theory","offset":276},{"uri":"Spacetime","surface_form":"spacetime","offset":320},{"uri":"String_theory","surface_form":"string theory","offset":414},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetry","offset":435}]}
