{"id":713600,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply","text":"e=\"preserve\">The money supply (or money stock) is the total value of money available in an economy at a point of time. There are many ways to define \"money\". Normal measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits. Each country\u2019s central bank may use its own definitions of what they consider to be money for its purposes.\nMoney supply data is recorded and published. It is done usually by the government or the central bank of the country. Public and private sector analysts look at changes in the money supply. This is because they believe that changes affect the price level of securities, inflation, the exchange rates and the business cycle.\nEmpirical measures in the United States Federal Reserve System.\nMoney is used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and as a ready store of value.\nThe ratio of a pair of these measures, most often M2 / M0, is called an (actual, empirical) money multiplier.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Economy","surface_form":"economy","offset":91},{"uri":"Circulation_(currency)","surface_form":"currency in circulation","offset":190},{"uri":"Demand_deposits","surface_form":"demand deposits","offset":218},{"uri":"Central_bank","surface_form":"central bank","offset":250},{"uri":"Central_bank","surface_form":"central bank","offset":432},{"uri":"Price_level","surface_form":"price level","offset":586},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":613},{"uri":"Exchange_rate","surface_form":"exchange rate","offset":628},{"uri":"Business_cycle","surface_form":"business cycle","offset":651},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"Money","offset":731},{"uri":"Medium_of_exchange","surface_form":"medium of exchange","offset":750},{"uri":"Unit_of_account","surface_form":"unit of account","offset":772},{"uri":"Store_of_value","surface_form":"store of value","offset":804},{"uri":"Money_multiplier","surface_form":"money multiplier","offset":912}]}
