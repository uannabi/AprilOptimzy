{"id":713603,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy","text":"e=\"preserve\">Monetary policy is the policy used by the monetary authority of a country that controls either the interest rate that can be paid on very short-term borrowing or the money supply. They often target inflation or the interest rate to help make price stability and general trust in the currency.\nOther goals of a monetary policy are usually to help make the gross domestic product more stable, to get and keep low unemployment, and to have predictable exchange rates with other currencies.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monetary_authority","surface_form":"monetary authority","offset":55},{"uri":"Interest_rate","surface_form":"interest rate","offset":112},{"uri":"Federal_funds","surface_form":"very short-term borrowing","offset":146},{"uri":"Money_supply","surface_form":"money supply","offset":179},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":211},{"uri":"Interest_rate","surface_form":"interest rate","offset":228},{"uri":"Price_stability","surface_form":"price stability","offset":255},{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":296},{"uri":"Gross_domestic_product","surface_form":"gross domestic product","offset":368},{"uri":"Unemployment","surface_form":"unemployment","offset":424},{"uri":"Exchange_rates","surface_form":"exchange rates","offset":462}]}
