{"id":713645,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_punk","text":"Celtic punk is punk rock mixed with traditional Celtic music.\nCeltic punk bands often play covers of traditional Irish, Welsh or Scottish folk and political songs. They will often make original songs too. Common themes in Celtic punk music include politics, Celtic culture and identity, heritage, religion, drinking and working class pride.\nThe genre became popular in the 1980s by The Pogues. The Pogues are a band of London Irish punk musicians in London. They celebrated their Irish heritage.\nThe term \"Celtic punk\" is usually used to describe bands who base their music in Irish or Scottish traditional music. It is considered part of the more general folk punk genre. However, folk punk is usually used for bands that use English, American and other forms of folk music as inspiration.\nThe usual Celtic punk band includes a rock instrument as well as traditional instruments such as bagpipes, fiddle, tin whistle, accordion, mandolin, and banjo. Like Celtic rock, Celtic punk is a form of Celtic fusion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":15},{"uri":"Celtic_music","surface_form":"Celtic music","offset":48},{"uri":"Cover","surface_form":"cover","offset":91},{"uri":"Theme","surface_form":"theme","offset":212},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":248},{"uri":"Gaelic_culture","surface_form":"Celtic culture","offset":258},{"uri":"Celtic_identity","surface_form":"identity","offset":277},{"uri":"Cultural_heritage","surface_form":"heritage","offset":287},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":297},{"uri":"Alcoholic_beverage","surface_form":"drinking","offset":307},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":320},{"uri":"The_Pogues","surface_form":"The Pogues","offset":382},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":437},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":450},{"uri":"Heritage","surface_form":"heritage","offset":486},{"uri":"Folk_punk","surface_form":"folk punk","offset":656},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":829},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"instrument","offset":834},{"uri":"Bagpipes","surface_form":"bagpipes","offset":888},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"fiddle","offset":898},{"uri":"Tin_whistle","surface_form":"tin whistle","offset":906},{"uri":"Accordion","surface_form":"accordion","offset":919},{"uri":"Mandolin","surface_form":"mandolin","offset":930},{"uri":"Banjo","surface_form":"banjo","offset":944},{"uri":"Celtic_rock","surface_form":"Celtic rock","offset":956},{"uri":"Celtic_fusion","surface_form":"Celtic fusion","offset":994}]}
