No candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round, so a runoff was held on 13 October.\nBefore the death of incumbent president Beji Caid Essebsi on 25 July, the elections had been planned for 17 and 24 November. However, as a result of Essebsi's death, the elections were brought forward in order to ensure that a new president would take office within 90 days, as required by the constitution.\nThe elections were the second direct vote for the presidency since the 2011 revolution.\nKa\u00EFs Sa\u00EFed and Nabil Karoui were the two candidates who made it to the run off. In the run-off, Sa\u00EFed won the election in a landslide victory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":36},{"uri":"Two-round_system","surface_form":"runoff","offset":136},{"uri":"Beji_Caid_Essebsi","surface_form":"Beji Caid Essebsi","offset":207},{"uri":"2011_Tunisian_revolution","surface_form":"2011 revolution","offset":546},{"uri":"Ka%C3%AFs_Sa%C3%AFed","surface_form":"Ka\u00EFs Sa\u00EFed","offset":563},{"uri":"Nabil_Karoui","surface_form":"Nabil Karoui","offset":578},{"uri":"Landslide_victory","surface_form":"landslide victory","offset":687}]}
