{"id":713827,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_gameplay","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cooperative gameplay (often abbreviated as co-op) is something in video games that allows players to work together as teammates. This would be different from other multiplayer modes, such as competitive multiplayer modes like player versus player or deathmatch. Playing at the same time allows players to help each another in many ways: giving weapons or items, healing, giving covering fire in a firefight, and doing cooperative things such as helping a teammate go past obstacles.\nCo-op gameplay has been becoming more popular in video games in recent years. This is partly because controller and networking technology has become better.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_games","surface_form":"video games","offset":79},{"uri":"Multiplayer_video_game","surface_form":"multiplayer","offset":177},{"uri":"Player_versus_player","surface_form":"player versus player","offset":239},{"uri":"Deathmatch_(gaming)","surface_form":"deathmatch","offset":263}]}
