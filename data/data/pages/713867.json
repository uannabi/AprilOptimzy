His name means lord of the mouth. Neper also represented sustenance and nourishment. He determined the times of the year when the crops grew, were harvested, and disappeared. He was worshipped mainly because he was a god that kept people healthy through their food.\nNeper was a god in human form. However, he had distinctive marks to represent grains. He had dots on his clothing to represent corn grains. He also had grains above his head, like in the picture to the left. He was also often shown carrying wheat, or similar crops. He wore little clothes, like in the picture where it shows him wearing a cloth around his waist. Neper was worshipped all over Egypt.\nNeper had a female version of himself, called Nepit. Nepit was the goddess of grain. Neper's mother, Renenutet, was a goddess of nourishment, and harvesting, who also represented grains. Neper was also seen as a form of Osiris, the god of death and the underworld. People saw him as a form of Osiris because he appeared and disappeared at the times of annual harvest, just like Osiris came back from the dead. He, along with Osiris, was often thought of the god that was \"Living after he had died\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":74},{"uri":"Wheat","surface_form":"wheat","offset":106},{"uri":"Corn","surface_form":"corn","offset":113},{"uri":"Barley","surface_form":"barley","offset":123},{"uri":"Renenutet","surface_form":"Renenutet","offset":898},{"uri":"Nourishment","surface_form":"nourishment","offset":926},{"uri":"Osiris","surface_form":"Osiris","offset":1017}]}
