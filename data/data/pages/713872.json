The storm struck eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Imelda created a \"very\" serious flash flood event in both states. It was one of the wettest tropical cyclones in U.S. history, particularly in Texas.\nThe Galveston/Houston area was \"especially\" hit hard by Imelda. Several people were killed due to flooding from the storm.\nThe storm also led to several tornadoes in Texas and Louisiana.\nImelda developed as a tropical storm near the southeast Texas coastline. The storm moved very slowly over southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2019_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2019","offset":58},{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"Atlantic tropical cyclone","offset":63},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":115},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":133},{"uri":"Flash_flood","surface_form":"flash flood","offset":176},{"uri":"Galveston%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Galveston","offset":298},{"uri":"Houston","surface_form":"Houston","offset":308},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornadoes","offset":447}]}
