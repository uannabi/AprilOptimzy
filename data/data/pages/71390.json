{"id":71390,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline","text":"Choline is an organic compound. It is the precursor molecule (~building block) for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is involved in many functions including memory and muscle control.\nSome animals cannot produce choline, but must have it in their diet to stay healthy. Humans make a small amount of choline in the liver. In the United States, choline is recommended as an essential nutrient after research showed that humans need to get it. They need to have choline in their diet or take a supplementation for proper health. Possible benefits include reducing the risk of neural tube defects and fatty liver disease. It has also been found that intake of choline during pregnancy can have long-term beneficial effects on memory for the child.\nCholine is usually grouped with the Vitamin B complex. It is a vitamin that is needed by the human body. Adults should take between 425 and 550 milligrams of it daily. Choline is used by the body in the walls of cells and as a neurotransmitter. It also helps to prevent heart disease. There are claims that it helps reduce body fat, but this has not been proven.\nHistory.\nCholine was discovered by Andreas Strecker in 1864. In 1998 choline was classified as an needed nutrient by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (USA).\nSources.\nSources of Choline are egg yolks, soy and cooked beef, chicken, veal and turkey (bird) livers. Many foods contain small amounts of choline, even iceberg lettuce.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":14},{"uri":"Neurotransmitter","surface_form":"neurotransmitter","offset":87},{"uri":"Acetylcholine","surface_form":"acetylcholine","offset":104},{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":173},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":184},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":330},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":344},{"uri":"Essential_nutrient","surface_form":"essential nutrient","offset":388},{"uri":"Dietary_supplement","surface_form":"supplementation","offset":507},{"uri":"B_vitamin_complex","surface_form":"Vitamin B complex","offset":796},{"uri":"Vitamin","surface_form":"vitamin","offset":823},{"uri":"Human_body","surface_form":"human body","offset":853},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":972},{"uri":"Neurotransmitter","surface_form":"neurotransmitter","offset":987},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":1030},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":1088},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"nutrient","offset":1228},{"uri":"Food_and_Nutrition_Board","surface_form":"Food and Nutrition Board","offset":1244},{"uri":"Institute_of_Medicine","surface_form":"Institute of Medicine","offset":1276},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":1299},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"egg","offset":1337},{"uri":"Yolk","surface_form":"yolk","offset":1341},{"uri":"Soybean","surface_form":"soy","offset":1348},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":1363},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":1369},{"uri":"Veal","surface_form":"veal","offset":1378},{"uri":"Turkey_(bird)","surface_form":"turkey (bird)","offset":1387},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":1401},{"uri":"Lettuce","surface_form":"lettuce","offset":1467}]}
