{"id":714046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_View","text":"Weekend View was a weekend morning show on The Weather Channel that aired from 5:00 to 11:00\u00A0a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday and Sunday mornings. It gave the forecast for the weekend, as well as the week ahead.\nProgram history.\nWeekend View was supposed to debut on September 17, 2005, but it was delayed to October 1, 2005 due to the busy Atlantic hurricane season. Initial plans included a primetime talk show in the second quarter of 2006, but that never came to function.\nIn fall 2006, Stephanie Abrams left the show for \"Abrams & Bettes Beyond the Forecast\" with Mike Bettes and was not replaced. A year later, Samantha Mohr joined The Weather Channel to replace Kelly Cass, who moved to \"PM Edition\". Cass returned to the program in May 2008. In April of that year, Dao Vu (who was the second non-meteorologist to host a live program, the other being Liz Jarvis-Fabian, who was with The Weather Channel from 1986 to 1989) left and was not replaced.\nIn March 2009, \"Weekend View\" was extended to 5-11\u00A0a.m. ET, replacing \"Weekend Outlook\". By this point Bill Keneely was moved to \"PM Edition\", and Betty Davis joined Kelly Cass on the 7-11\u00A0a.m. block. Jeff Morrow and Alex Wallace hosted the new 5-7\u00A0a.m. block.\nIn July 2010, Betty Davis left the show and The Weather Channel. She was replaced by Maria LaRosa.\nIn November 2010, Cass moved to \"Weather Center\" and Maria LaRosa joined Todd Santos for \"Weekend Now\". Jen Carfagno and Eric Fisher were their replacements on the 7-11\u00A0a.m. block.\nIn July 2012, Wallace left for \"First Outlook\", and was replaced by Danielle Banks. In October, Morrow left The Weather Channel, and was replaced by Ray Stagich. In November, Banks left for \"Weekend Now\" and \"Weather Center Live\", but was not replaced.\nIn July 2013, Eric Fisher left The Weather Channel, and was replaced by Reynolds Wolf.\nOn November 10, 2013, Weekend View aired its last broadcast. It was replaced by \"Weather Center Live\" on November 16, as part of the 2013 relaunch of The Weather Channel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weekend","surface_form":"weekend","offset":19},{"uri":"Morning","surface_form":"morning","offset":27},{"uri":"The_Weather_Channel","surface_form":"The Weather Channel","offset":43},{"uri":"2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Atlantic hurricane season","offset":338},{"uri":"Stephanie_Abrams","surface_form":"Stephanie Abrams","offset":488},{"uri":"Abrams_%26amp%3B_Bettes_Beyond_the_Forecast","surface_form":"Abrams & Bettes Beyond the Forecast","offset":524},{"uri":"Mike_Bettes","surface_form":"Mike Bettes","offset":566},{"uri":"Samantha_Mohr","surface_form":"Samantha Mohr","offset":614},{"uri":"Kelly_Cass","surface_form":"Kelly Cass","offset":666},{"uri":"PM_Edition","surface_form":"PM Edition","offset":692},{"uri":"Liz_Jarvis-Fabian","surface_form":"Liz Jarvis-Fabian","offset":855},{"uri":"Weekend_Outlook","surface_form":"Weekend Outlook","offset":1024},{"uri":"Bill_Keneely","surface_form":"Bill Keneely","offset":1056},{"uri":"Betty_Davis_(meteorologist)","surface_form":"Betty Davis","offset":1100},{"uri":"Jeff_Morrow_(meteorologist)","surface_form":"Jeff Morrow","offset":1154},{"uri":"Alex_Wallace_(meteorologist)","surface_form":"Alex Wallace","offset":1170},{"uri":"Weather_Center_Live","surface_form":"Weather Center","offset":1346},{"uri":"Maria_LaRosa","surface_form":"Maria LaRosa","offset":1366},{"uri":"Todd_Santos","surface_form":"Todd Santos","offset":1386},{"uri":"Weekend_Now","surface_form":"Weekend Now","offset":1403},{"uri":"Jen_Carfagno","surface_form":"Jen Carfagno","offset":1417},{"uri":"Eric_Fisher_(meteorologist)","surface_form":"Eric Fisher","offset":1434},{"uri":"First_Outlook","surface_form":"First Outlook","offset":1526},{"uri":"Danielle_Banks","surface_form":"Danielle Banks","offset":1562},{"uri":"Ray_Stagich","surface_form":"Ray Stagich","offset":1643},{"uri":"Weather_Center_Live","surface_form":"Weather Center Live","offset":1703},{"uri":"Reynolds_Wolf","surface_form":"Reynolds Wolf","offset":1819}]}
