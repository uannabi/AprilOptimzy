{"id":714170,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Doolittle","text":"W. Ford Doolittle (born February 21, 1941 in Urbana, Illinois) is Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nDoolittle is an evolutionary and molecular biologist. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and other awards.\nDoolittle studied cyanobacteria. He found evidence for the endosymbiont origins of chloroplasts. He has a theory for the initial evolution of eukaryotes. He has shown why horizontal gene transfer is important to prokaryotic evolution.\nIn 1981, Doolittle received notice for his article in \"The CoEvolution Quarterly\" entitled \"Is Nature Really Motherly?\". This was a criticism of J. E. Lovelock's formulation of the Gaia Theory. Doolittle's article is often cited by Lovelock's critics.\nDoolittle thinks the idea of an all-encompassing Tree of Life is wrong. However, he is not a supporter of intelligent design. A \"single\" common ancestor and tree of all of life on Earth is not the only way evolution could have happened.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urbana%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Urbana, Illinois","offset":45},{"uri":"Professor_Emeritus","surface_form":"Professor Emeritus","offset":66},{"uri":"Dalhousie_University","surface_form":"Dalhousie University","offset":88},{"uri":"Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Halifax, Nova Scotia","offset":112},{"uri":"Evolutionary","surface_form":"evolutionary","offset":150},{"uri":"Molecular_biologist","surface_form":"molecular biologist","offset":167},{"uri":"National_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"National Academy of Sciences","offset":213},{"uri":"Royal_Society_of_Canada","surface_form":"Royal Society of Canada","offset":262},{"uri":"Cyanobacteria","surface_form":"cyanobacteria","offset":322},{"uri":"Endosymbiont","surface_form":"endosymbiont","offset":363},{"uri":"Chloroplasts","surface_form":"chloroplasts","offset":387},{"uri":"Eukaryotes","surface_form":"eukaryotes","offset":446},{"uri":"Horizontal_gene_transfer","surface_form":"horizontal gene transfer","offset":475},{"uri":"Prokaryotic","surface_form":"prokaryotic","offset":516},{"uri":"James_Lovelock","surface_form":"J.
