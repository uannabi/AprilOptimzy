{"id":71418,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine","text":"Adenine is one of the nucleobase or basic molecules which form DNA and RNA. They are usually called Nitrogenous bases in genetics.\nFunction.\nIn DNA, adenine sticks to thymine with two hydrogen bonds to help in making the nucleic acid structures stronger. In RNA, which is used in the cytoplasm for protein synthesis, adenine sticks to uracil.\nHistory.\nAdenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4, but no longer. However, two B vitamins, niacin and riboflavin, bind with adenine to form the essential cofactors NAD and FAD respectively.\nSome think that, at the origin of life on Earth, the first adenine was formed by the polymerization (joining) of five hydrogen cyanide (HCN) molecules. This is not generally accepted.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nucleobase","surface_form":"nucleobase","offset":22},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecule","offset":42},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":63},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":71},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":121},{"uri":"Thymine","surface_form":"thymine","offset":167},{"uri":"Hydrogen_bonds","surface_form":"hydrogen bonds","offset":184},{"uri":"Cytoplasm","surface_form":"cytoplasm","offset":284},{"uri":"Protein_synthesis","surface_form":"protein synthesis","offset":298},{"uri":"Uracil","surface_form":"uracil","offset":335},{"uri":"Niacin","surface_form":"niacin","offset":433},{"uri":"Riboflavin","surface_form":"riboflavin","offset":444},{"uri":"Cofactor","surface_form":"cofactor","offset":496},{"uri":"NAD","surface_form":"NAD","offset":506},{"uri":"FAD","surface_form":"FAD","offset":514},{"uri":"Origin_of_life","surface_form":"origin of life","offset":556},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":574},{"uri":"Polymerization","surface_form":"polymerization","offset":617},{"uri":"Hydrogen_cyanide","surface_form":"hydrogen cyanide","offset":650}]}
