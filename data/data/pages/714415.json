{"id":714415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_(New_Spain)","text":"Louisiana () was an administrative district of the Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1763 to 1801. It included the area west of the Mississippi River basin, plus New Orleans. Spain got the territory from France, which had named it \"La Louisiane\" after King Louis XIV in 1682. It is sometimes called Spanish Louisiana. The district was given back to France, under the terms of the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso (1800) and the Treaty of Aranjuez (1801). In 1802, King Charles IV of Spain wrote a royal bill on 14 October. This changed the transfer and outlined the conditions.\nHowever, Spain agreed to still run the colony until French officials came and made the transfer official (1803). The ceremony happened at the Cabildo in New Orleans on 30 November 1803. This was just three weeks before the formalities of cession from France to the United States pursuant to the Louisiana Purchase.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Viceroyalty","surface_form":"Viceroyalty","offset":51},{"uri":"New_Spain","surface_form":"New Spain","offset":66},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":128},{"uri":"%C3%8Ele_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":158},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":171},{"uri":"Early_modern_France","surface_form":"France","offset":200},{"uri":"Louisiana_(New_France)","surface_form":"La Louisiane","offset":228},{"uri":"Louis_XIV_of_France","surface_form":"Louis XIV","offset":253},{"uri":"Third_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso","surface_form":"Third Treaty of San Ildefonso","offset":376},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Aranjuez_(1801)","surface_form":"Treaty of Aranjuez (1801)","offset":421},{"uri":"Charles_IV_of_Spain","surface_form":"Charles IV of Spain","offset":462},{"uri":"The_Cabildo","surface_form":"the Cabildo","offset":709},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":724},{"uri":"French_First_Republic","surface_form":"France","offset":822},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":836},{"uri":"Louisiana_Purchase","surface_form":"Louisiana Purchase","offset":866}]}
