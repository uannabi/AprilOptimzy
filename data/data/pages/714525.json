{"id":714525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bay_Castle","text":"Red Bay Castle () is located in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, on a piece of land projecting into the sea north of Glenariff located on the road to Cushendall.\nHistory.\nIt was built by the Bissett family in the 13th century on the site of an earlier motte-and-bailey outpost of the Kingdom of D\u00E1l Riata. The Bissett family were stripped of their lands in Scotland and fled for their lives to Ireland after Walter de Bisset was accused of the murder of Patrick, Earl of Atholl, at Haddington, East Lothian in 1242. King Henry III of England granted Bisset large possessions in the Barony of Glenarm, Ireland.\nJohn Mor MacDonald 1st of Dunnyveg married Margery Bissett of the Glens of Antrim, and acquired as a result the castle of Red Bay. His descendants known as the MacDonnells of Antrim extended and rebuilt the castle in the 16th century. In 1565, the castle was burned to the ground by Shane O'Neill, chief of the O'Neills of Tyrone; it was rebuilt by Sorley Boy MacDonnell, however later fell into disrepair.\nIn 1604 the castle was restored and was later destroyed by Oliver Cromwell in 1652 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County_Antrim","surface_form":"County Antrim","offset":32},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":47},{"uri":"Glenariff","surface_form":"Glenariff","offset":117},{"uri":"Cushendall","surface_form":"Cushendall","offset":150},{"uri":"Bissett_family_(Ireland)","surface_form":"Bissett family","offset":191},{"uri":"Motte-and-bailey","surface_form":"motte-and-bailey","offset":252},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_D%C3%A1l_Riata","surface_form":"Kingdom of D\u00E1l Riata","offset":284},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":357},{"uri":"Padraig%2C_Earl_of_Atholl","surface_form":"Patrick","offset":454},{"uri":"Earl_of_Atholl","surface_form":"Earl of Atholl","offset":463},{"uri":"Haddington%2C_East_Lothian","surface_form":"Haddington","offset":482},{"uri":"East_Lothian","surface_form":"East Lothian","offset":494},{"uri":"Henry_III_of_England","surface_form":"Henry III of England","offset":521},{"uri":"Barony_of_Glenarm","surface_form":"Barony of Glenarm","offset":582},{"uri":"John_M%C3%B3r_Tanister","surface_form":"John Mor MacDonald","offset":610},{"uri":"Clan_MacDonald_of_Dunnyveg","surface_form":"1st of Dunnyveg","offset":629},{"uri":"Margery_Byset","surface_form":"Margery Bissett","offset":653},{"uri":"Glens_of_Antrim","surface_form":"Glens of Antrim","offset":676},{"uri":"MacDonnells_of_Antrim","surface_form":"MacDonnells of Antrim","offset":770},{"uri":"S%C3%A9an_%C3%93_N%C3%A9ill","surface_form":"Shane O'Neill","offset":893},{"uri":"O%27Neills_of_Tyrone","surface_form":"O'Neills of Tyrone","offset":921},{"uri":"Sorley_Boy_MacDonnell","surface_form":"Sorley Boy MacDonnell","offset":959},{"uri":"Oliver_Cromwell","surface_form":"Oliver Cromwell","offset":1076},{"uri":"Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Cromwellian conquest of Ireland","offset":1111}]}
