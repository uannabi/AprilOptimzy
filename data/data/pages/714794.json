{"id":714794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria_people","text":"The Peoria (or Peouaroua) are a Native American people. They are in the federally recognized Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma. Historically, they were part of the Illinois Confederation.\nTraditionally, the Peoria spoke a dialect of the Miami-Illinois language. The name \"Peoria\" comes from their autonym (name for themselves) in the Illinois language, \"peewaareewa\" (modern pronunciation \"peewaalia\"). It first meant \"Comes carrying a pack on his back.\" No speakers of the Peoria language are alive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_Americans_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Native American","offset":32},{"uri":"Federally_recognized_tribes","surface_form":"federally recognized","offset":72},{"uri":"Illinois_Confederation","surface_form":"Illinois Confederation","offset":166},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":224},{"uri":"Miami-Illinois_language","surface_form":"Miami-Illinois language","offset":239},{"uri":"Endonym","surface_form":"autonym","offset":299}]}
