{"id":71480,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_English","text":"Simplified English is a set of approved words and writing rules. Its makers made it to help engineers write manuals (instruction books) so that people all over the world can read them.\nThe rules say to only use the words in simplified English in approved ways. This decreases misunderstanding. For example, the rules approve the use of the verb \"close\" (\"Do not close the door\"). The rules approve the use of the adjective \"closed\", meaning \"not open\" (\"The door is not closed\"). The adjective \"close\" means near (\"Do not go close to the door\"). The rules disapprove the use of the adjective \"close\". The rules approve the use of the adjective \"near\" (\"Do not go near the door\") for this meaning. The rules specify the use of the adjective \"near\" instead of the adjective \"close\". This way, the reader can be sure if the instructions say to keep the door open or to stay far from the door.\nPeople started developing simplified English in the 1970s. People continue developing simplified English today. AECMA is the \"European Association of Aerospace Manufacturers\". AECMA began work on simplified English. ASD is the \"AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe\". ASD has a Maintenance Group called STEMG that continues work on simplified English. STEMG is the \"Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group\". STEMG maintains the ASD-STE100, the latest simplified English.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Engineers","surface_form":"engineers","offset":92}]}
