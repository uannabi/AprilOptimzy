{"id":714807,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaho","text":"The Arapaho (;,) are a tribe of Native Americans. They used to live on the plains of Colorado and Wyoming. They were close friends of the Cheyenne tribe. They were barely friends with the Lakota and Dakota.\nEarly history.\nAround 3,000 years ago, the ancestors of the Arapaho-speaking people (\"Heeteinono'eino\") lived in the western Great Lakes region. They lived there along the Red River Valley. This would be in what is present-day Manitoba, Canada and Minnesota, United States. The Arapaho were an agricultural people. They grew crops, including maize.\nLanguage.\nThe Arapaho language is currently spoken in two different dialects. It is considered to be a part the Algonquian language family. There are only about 250 fluent speakers of Northern Arapaho. Most of them live on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. There are even fewer fluent Southern Arapaho speakers. All of them are very old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":32},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":85},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":98},{"uri":"Cheyenne","surface_form":"Cheyenne","offset":138},{"uri":"Lakota_people","surface_form":"Lakota","offset":188},{"uri":"Dakota_people","surface_form":"Dakota","offset":199},{"uri":"Red_River_Valley","surface_form":"Red River Valley","offset":379},{"uri":"Manitoba","surface_form":"Manitoba","offset":434},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":455},{"uri":"Maize","surface_form":"maize","offset":549},{"uri":"Arapaho_language","surface_form":"Arapaho language","offset":570},{"uri":"Wind_River_Indian_Reservation","surface_form":"Wind River Reservation","offset":783}]}
