{"id":71484,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine","text":"Thymine, or 5-methyluracil, is a pyrimidine base found in the nucleic acid DNA.\nIn RNA thymine is swapped for uracil to represent the same genetic information. In DNA, thymine (T) connects to adenine (A) by two hydrogen bonds. These pair bonds hold the two strands of the DNA double helix structure together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pyrimidine","surface_form":"pyrimidine","offset":33},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"base","offset":44},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":62},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":75},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":83},{"uri":"Uracil","surface_form":"uracil","offset":110},{"uri":"Adenine","surface_form":"adenine","offset":192},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":211},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bonds","offset":220}]}
