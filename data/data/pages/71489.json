{"id":71489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution","text":"Probability distribution is a term from mathematics. Suppose there are many events with random outcomes. A probability distribution is the theoretical counterpart to the frequency distribution. A frequency distribution simply shows how many times a certain event occurred. A probability distribution says how many times it \"should\" have occurred in the long run (that is, its probability). The probability distribution of a random variable formula_1 is often written as formula_1 (or simply formula_1). Such a distribution can either be discrete, taking a discrete (or countable) amount of values, or continuous, taking an uncountable amount of values (as from a continuous interval).\nwhere result is the outcome of the dice roll, and the probability shows the chances of that result occurring. If we roll a dice 60 times, then in the long run, we should expect to have each side appear 10 times on average.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Term","surface_form":"term","offset":30},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":40},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":88},{"uri":"Frequency_distribution","surface_form":"frequency distribution","offset":170},{"uri":"Probability","surface_form":"probability","offset":376},{"uri":"Countable_set","surface_form":"countable","offset":569},{"uri":"Uncountable_set","surface_form":"uncountable","offset":623},{"uri":"Interval_(mathematics)","surface_form":"interval","offset":674}]}
