In the sequence of North American pre-Columbian cultural stages, is a period defined by the \"archaic stage\" of cultural development.\nThe Archaic stage is characterized by subsistence economies. These economies were supported through the use of nuts, seeds, and shellfish. Because it ended when people started using sedentary farming, this date can be different by a lot across the Americas.\nThe rest of the Americas also have an Archaic Period.\nClassifications.\nThis classification system was first proposed by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in the widely accepted 1958 book \"Method and Theory in American Archaeology\".\nIn the organization of the system, the Archaic period is after the Lithic stage. THe Archaic period is before the Formative stage.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":76},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":167},{"uri":"Pre-Columbian","surface_form":"pre-Columbian","offset":182},{"uri":"Subsistence_economy","surface_form":"subsistence","offset":319},{"uri":"Nut_(fruit)","surface_form":"nut","offset":392},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":398},{"uri":"Shellfish","surface_form":"shellfish","offset":409},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":473},{"uri":"Archaic_Period_(Americas)","surface_form":"Archaic Period","offset":577},{"uri":"Gordon_Willey","surface_form":"Gordon Willey","offset":659},{"uri":"Philip_Phillips_(archaeologist)","surface_form":"Philip Phillips","offset":677},{"uri":"Lithic_stage","surface_form":"Lithic stage","offset":838},{"uri":"Formative_stage","surface_form":"Formative stage","offset":885}]}
