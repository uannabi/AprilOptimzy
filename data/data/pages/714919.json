{"id":714919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37th_parallel_north","text":"The 37th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 37 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.\nAt this latitude, the sun can be seen for 14 hours, 42 minutes during the summer solstice and 9 hours, 37 minutes during the winter solstice. This is about the northern limit of the visibility of Canopus, the second-brightest star of the night sky.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the parallel is the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, and Kansas, and the northern borders of Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The border comes from the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854 when Congress divided Indian Territory into Kansas and Nebraska north of the 37th parallel. They gave the rest to the Indian Territory to the south.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circle_of_latitude","surface_form":"circle of latitude","offset":29},{"uri":"Degree_(angle)","surface_form":"degrees","offset":59},{"uri":"True_north","surface_form":"north","offset":67},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth's","offset":80},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equatorial plane","offset":88},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":117},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":129},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":148},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":156},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":166},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":181},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":204},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":242},{"uri":"Summer_solstice","surface_form":"summer solstice","offset":294},{"uri":"Winter_solstice","surface_form":"winter solstice","offset":345},{"uri":"Canopus","surface_form":"Canopus","offset":416},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":491},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":546},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":552},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":566},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":602},{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":611},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":627},{"uri":"Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska_Act","surface_form":"Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act","offset":663},{"uri":"Indian_Territory","surface_form":"Indian Territory","offset":713}]}
