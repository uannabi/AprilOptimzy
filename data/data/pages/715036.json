He was known in the media as \"The Lonely Hearts Killer\" and \"The Glamour Girl Slayer\". He would use several pseudonyms, posing as a professional photographer to lure his victims with the promise of a modelling career.\nGlatman was later found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder by California and sentenced to death, a sentence that he accepted willingly. He specifically asked the warden to do nothing to save his life. He was executed in the gas chamber of San Quentin State Prison on September 18, 1959.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
