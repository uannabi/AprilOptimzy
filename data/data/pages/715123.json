It is native to India and is also grown in plantations elsewhere in Pakistan (Chiniot).\nMadagascar rosewood (\"Dalbergia maritima\"), known as \"bois de rose\", is highly prized for its red colour. It is overexploited in the wild. A 2010 moratorium on trade and illegal logging is being ignored.\nThroughout southeast Asia \"Dalbergia oliveri\" is harvested for use in woodworking. It has a fragrant odour. \"Dalbergia cultrata\" is being used and sold as \"D. olvieri\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":35},{"uri":"Chiniot","surface_form":"Pakistan (Chiniot)","offset":384},{"uri":"Moratorium","surface_form":"moratorium","offset":550},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":574},{"uri":"Logging","surface_form":"logging","offset":582},{"uri":"Woodworking","surface_form":"woodworking","offset":678},{"uri":"Odour","surface_form":"odour","offset":709}]}
