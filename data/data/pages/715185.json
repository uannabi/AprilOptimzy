The film focuses on the World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who did not carry or use a weapon or firearm of any kind. This was because he was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian. Doss became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty during the Battle of Okinawa. Andrew Garfield stars as Doss, with Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, and Vince Vaughn in supporting roles.\nThe movie was released in the United States on November 4, 2016.
