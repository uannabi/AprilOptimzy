{"id":715206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatal_hernia","text":"e=\"preserve\">A hiatal hernia is a kind of hernia in which abdominal organs, usually the stomach, slip through the diaphragm. This may result in gastroesophageal reflux disease (or GERD) or heartburn. There are other symptoms, like dysphagia (or trouble swallowing) and chest pain. Other problems may include bowel obstruction and iron deficiency anemia.\nThe most common risk factors are obesity and older age. Other risk factors are scoliosis, injury and several types of surgery.\nBetween ten and eighty percent of people in the United States are affected with hiatal hernias.\nThe symptoms from a hiatal hernia might be improved by changes, like weight loss, changing eating patterns and raising the head of a bed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hernia","surface_form":"hernia","offset":42},{"uri":"Organ_(anatomy)","surface_form":"organs","offset":68},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":88},{"uri":"Diaphragm","surface_form":"diaphragm","offset":114},{"uri":"Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease","surface_form":"gastroesophageal reflux disease","offset":144},{"uri":"Heartburn","surface_form":"heartburn","offset":189},{"uri":"Dysphagia","surface_form":"dysphagia","offset":231},{"uri":"Chest","surface_form":"chest","offset":269},{"uri":"Bowel_obstruction","surface_form":"bowel obstruction","offset":308},{"uri":"Iron_deficiency_anemia","surface_form":"iron deficiency anemia","offset":330},{"uri":"Obesity","surface_form":"obesity","offset":387},{"uri":"Older_age","surface_form":"older age","offset":399},{"uri":"Scoliosis","surface_form":"scoliosis","offset":433},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injury","offset":444},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":472},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":529},{"uri":"Weight_loss","surface_form":"weight loss","offset":646}]}
