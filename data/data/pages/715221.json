{"id":715221,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium","text":"e=\"preserve\">A consortium (which may also be called syndicate) is formed by two or more independent companies, individuals, or other economic actors that work together for a limited amount of time, usually to fulfill a purpose. Consortia are common in the building industries, roads and bridges are often built by consortia.\nOverview.\nThe term can be traced to the 16th century, where it developed from \"con sortes\", which is the plural of Latin \"consors\". It can roughly be translated as \"united by fate\". The english word consort probably has the same origin.\nThe company Airbus started as a consortium of different companies with the aim of building airplanes.\nIn 1970, they officially formed a \"groupement d'int\u00E9r\u00EAt \u00E9conomique\" (which is a consortium, in the French legal system). Today, Airbus is a Societas Europaea, a shareholding company under European law. Not all consortia are done for profit: The Unicode consortium wants to promote the Unicode standard. It is a non-profit organisation, based in California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Airbus","surface_form":"Airbus","offset":574},{"uri":"Airplane","surface_form":"airplane","offset":653},{"uri":"Societas_Europaea","surface_form":"Societas Europaea","offset":804},{"uri":"Unicode_consortium","surface_form":"Unicode consortium","offset":909},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":949},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":1009}]}
