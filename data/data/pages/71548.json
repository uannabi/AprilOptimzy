{"id":71548,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution","text":"In probability theory and statistics, the chi-square distribution (also chi-squared or formula_1\u00A0 distribution) is one of the most widely used theoretical probability distributions. Chi-square distribution with formula_1 degrees of freedom is written as formula_1. It is a special case of gamma distribution.\nChi-square distribution is primarily used in statistical significance tests and confidence intervals. It is useful, because it is relatively easy to show that certain probability distributions come close to it, under certain conditions. One of these conditions is that the null hypothesis must be true. Another one is that the different random variables (or observations) must be independent of each other.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability theory","offset":3},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":26},{"uri":"Theory","surface_form":"theoretical","offset":143},{"uri":"Probability_distribution","surface_form":"probability distribution","offset":155},{"uri":"Gamma_distribution","surface_form":"gamma distribution","offset":289},{"uri":"Statistical_significance","surface_form":"statistical significance","offset":354},{"uri":"Confidence_interval","surface_form":"confidence intervals","offset":389},{"uri":"Null_hypothesis","surface_form":"null hypothesis","offset":582}]}
