It has a long handle, and a tip with a flat end for hitting nails. The most common type of hammer (sometimes called a \"claw hammer\") has a curved end (on the other side of the hitting end) for pulling nails out.\nA sledgehammer is a hammer that has a longer shaft, and a more massive head. The user can swing it with two hands and apply more force.\nHistory.\nHammers were used around 3.3 million years ago. The first hammers were made without handles. Stones attached to sticks with strips of leather or animal sinew were being used. Hammers with handles were made in 30,000 BCE during the middle of the Paleolithic Stone Age. The hammer was used for building, food and protection.\nHammers as weapons.\nBig hammers were sometimes used as weapons. A tiny hammer is also used inside most small arms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":34},{"uri":"Hammer_(piano)","surface_form":"Hammer (piano)","offset":48},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":78},{"uri":"Nail","surface_form":"nail","offset":95},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":122},{"uri":"Palaeolithic","surface_form":"Paleolithic","offset":730},{"uri":"Stone_Age","surface_form":"Stone Age","offset":742},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":863},{"uri":"Small_arm","surface_form":"small arm","offset":911}]}
