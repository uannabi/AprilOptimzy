With Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert he was involved in a series of tests done at Harvard University, in the 1960s. These tests involved psychedelic drugs.\nIn the 1960s, professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert collaborated on a book titled \"The Psychedelic Experience\", which adapted portions of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" as a guide for use in LSD experiences. They hoped to give users of LSD a simulation of death and rebirth, to \"liberate\" them from past problems or mistakes in their lives.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":62},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":80},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":112},{"uri":"Timothy_Leary","surface_form":"Timothy Leary","offset":126},{"uri":"Ram_Dass","surface_form":"Richard Alpert","offset":144},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":204},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":231},{"uri":"Psychedelic","surface_form":"psychedelic","offset":259},{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":271},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":285},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":292},{"uri":"Psychedelic","surface_form":"Psychedelic","offset":386},{"uri":"Experience","surface_form":"Experience","offset":398},{"uri":"Tibetan_Book_of_the_Dead","surface_form":"Tibetan Book of the Dead","offset":442},{"uri":"Lysergic_acid_diethylamide","surface_form":"LSD","offset":490},{"uri":"Simulation","surface_form":"simulation","offset":541}]}
