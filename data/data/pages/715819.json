{"id":715819,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent","text":"e=\"preserve\">In medicine, a stent is a metal or plastic tube inserted into the lumen of an anatomic vessel or duct to keep the passageway open, and stenting is the placement of a stent. \"Stent\" is also used as a verb to describe the placement of such a device, particularly when a disease such as atherosclerosis has pathologically narrowed a structure such as an artery.\nA stent is different from a shunt. A shunt is a tube that connects two previously unconnected parts of the body to allow fluid to flow between them. Stents and shunts can be made of similar materials but perform two different tasks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":16},{"uri":"Lumen_(anatomy)","surface_form":"lumen","offset":79},{"uri":"Verb","surface_form":"verb","offset":212},{"uri":"Atherosclerosis","surface_form":"atherosclerosis","offset":297},{"uri":"Pathology","surface_form":"pathologically","offset":317},{"uri":"Artery","surface_form":"artery","offset":364},{"uri":"Shunt_(medical)","surface_form":"shunt","offset":400}]}
