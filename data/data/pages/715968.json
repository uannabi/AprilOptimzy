He was born in Danville, Georgia.\nHe was known for working as a security guard for AT&T during the Centennial Olympic Park bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. He found a backpack filled with three pipe bombs on the park grounds, Jewell called the police and helped to evacuate the area before the bomb exploded, saving many people from injury or death.\nAfter the bombing, Jewell was seen as a hero but later he was viewed as a suspect, before being cleared. Jewell's case is considered an example of the damage that can be done by media reporting based on unreliable or incomplete information.\nDespite never being charged, the media continued to criticize Jewell and calling him the suspected bomber. Jewell was eventually found not guilty, and Eric Rudolph was later found to have been the bomber.\nIn 2006, Governor Sonny Perdue publicly thanked Jewell on behalf of the State of Georgia for saving the lives of those at the Olympics.\nJewell died on August 29, 2007 of heart failure caused by diabetes in Woodbury, Georgia at age 44.\nIn 2019, Clint Eastwood directed a movie about him titled \"Richard Jewell\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Danville%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Danville, Georgia","offset":164},{"uri":"Security_guard","surface_form":"security guard","offset":213},{"uri":"AT%26amp%3BT","surface_form":"AT&T","offset":232},{"uri":"Centennial_Olympic_Park_bombing","surface_form":"Centennial Olympic Park bombing","offset":248},{"uri":"1996_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1996 Summer Olympics","offset":287},{"uri":"Atlanta%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Atlanta, Georgia","offset":311},{"uri":"Suspect","surface_form":"suspect","offset":597},{"uri":"Eric_Rudolph","surface_form":"Eric Rudolph","offset":915},{"uri":"Sonny_Perdue","surface_form":"Sonny Perdue","offset":987},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"State of Georgia","offset":1041},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":1139},{"uri":"Diabetes","surface_form":"diabetes","offset":1163},{"uri":"Woodbury%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Woodbury, Georgia","offset":1175},{"uri":"Clint_Eastwood","surface_form":"Clint Eastwood","offset":1213},{"uri":"Richard_Jewell_(movie)","surface_form":"Richard Jewell","offset":1263}]}
