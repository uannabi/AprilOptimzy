{"id":716036,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume","text":"e=\"preserve\">In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a measurement that can put induced consumption into numbers. Induced consumption is the idea that an increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) happens with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which people spend on consumption is called the propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of more income that a person spends. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents of that dollar. Obviously, the household cannot spend \"more\" than the extra dollar (without borrowing).\nJohn Maynard Keynes says that the marginal propensity to consume is less than one.\nThe MPC is higher for poorer people than in rich.\nBackground.\nMathematically, the formula_1 function is written as the derivative of the consumption function formula_1 with respect to disposable income formula_1, i.e., the instantaneous slope of the formula_1-formula_1 curve.\nHere formula_1; formula_1\nTherefore, formula_1 or 83%.\nFor example, suppose you receive a bonus with your paycheck, and it's $500 on top of your normal annual earnings. You now have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on something, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 (formula_1).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":16},{"uri":"Induced_consumption","surface_form":"induced consumption","offset":98},{"uri":"Consumption_(economics)","surface_form":"consumption","offset":212},{"uri":"Disposable_income","surface_form":"disposable income","offset":253},{"uri":"John_Maynard_Keynes","surface_form":"John Maynard Keynes","offset":755},{"uri":"Derivative","surface_form":"derivative","offset":957},{"uri":"Consumption_function","surface_form":"consumption function","offset":975}]}
