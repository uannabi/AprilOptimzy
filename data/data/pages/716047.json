Douglas was elected Premier of Saskatchewan and created universal healthcare for it. Douglas\u2019s health plan was copied by other provinces and spread to all of Canada. Douglas also created a Socialist political party called the New Democratic Party or NDP.\nDouglas is generally very respected because he created Canada\u2019s universal healthcare system but recently some people have suggested that he should not be that praised because in the 1930\u2019s he was a supporter of eugenics.\nDouglas died of cancer on 24 February 1986, at the age of 81 in Ottawa. His daughter, Shirley Douglas, was an actress.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadian","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":66},{"uri":"Socialist","surface_form":"socialist","offset":75},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":85},{"uri":"Saskatchewan","surface_form":"Saskatchewan","offset":101},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":133},{"uri":"CCF","surface_form":"CCF","offset":160},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialism","offset":177},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":195},{"uri":"Premier_of_Saskatchewan","surface_form":"Premier of Saskatchewan","offset":230},{"uri":"Universal_healthcare","surface_form":"universal healthcare","offset":266},{"uri":"Provinces","surface_form":"provinces","offset":337},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":368},{"uri":"Socialist","surface_form":"Socialist","offset":399},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":409},{"uri":"New_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"New Democratic Party","offset":436},{"uri":"NDP","surface_form":"NDP","offset":460},{"uri":"Universal_healthcare","surface_form":"universal healthcare","offset":529},{"uri":"Eugenics","surface_form":"eugenics","offset":676},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":702},{"uri":"Ottawa","surface_form":"Ottawa","offset":750},{"uri":"Shirley_Douglas","surface_form":"Shirley Douglas","offset":772}]}
