{"id":716196,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy","text":"Apostasy is a term used in a religious context, for leaving one's religion. Usually it means moving to another religion. Someone who does this is called an apostate. Apostasy is different from heresy: A heretic only questions one (or more) of the traditions and beliefs of their religion. An apostate questions all of them.\nThe word was first used in Christianity: In the Roman Catholic Church the punishment for apostasy is excommunication. Today, the word is used mostly in the context of apostasy in Islam.\nSometimes the term is used as a metaphor to refer to changing a non-religious belief or cause, such as a political party or a sports team.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":66},{"uri":"Heresy","surface_form":"heresy","offset":193},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":351},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":372},{"uri":"Excommunication","surface_form":"excommunication","offset":425},{"uri":"Apostasy_in_Islam","surface_form":"apostasy in Islam","offset":491},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":542},{"uri":"Political_party","surface_form":"political party","offset":615},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sports","offset":636}]}
