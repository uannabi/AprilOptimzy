{"id":716343,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_goshawk","text":"The northern goshawk \"Accipiter gentilis\") is a medium-large raptor in the family Accipitridae.\nThere are other species in this genus, but this bird is spoken of as \"the\" goshawk because it has a wide range over most of Europe, Eurasia and North America. Probably only the golden eagle has a wider range.\nThe goshawk is a \"true hawk\", and its scientific name in Latin is \"Accipiter\", which means \"hawk\".\nIn the Middle Ages only the nobility were permitted to fly goshawks for falconry.\nIt is mainly a resident bird, but those from colder regions migrate south for the winter. In North America, migratory goshawks are often seen migrating south along mountain ridge tops at nearly any time of the fall, depending on latitude.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bird_of_prey","surface_form":"raptor","offset":61},{"uri":"Accipitridae","surface_form":"Accipitridae","offset":82},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":112},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":128},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":220},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":228},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":240},{"uri":"Golden_eagle","surface_form":"golden eagle","offset":273},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":362},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":411},{"uri":"Falconry","surface_form":"falconry","offset":476},{"uri":"Bird_migration","surface_form":"migrate","offset":546}]}
