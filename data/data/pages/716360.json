{"id":716360,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2_inhibitors","text":"e=\"preserve\">COX-2 inhibitors are a special type of analgesic. Cyclooxygenase (commonly abbreviated as COX) is an enzyme that has an important role in starting an inflammation and pain. There are many different types of COX; the most common are known as COX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs work by blocking COX. The problem with blocking all COX is that COX-1 is also used to regulate kidney function. Blocking COX-1 runs the risk of bleeding of the stomach, and reduction of the kidney function. COX-2 inhibitors only block COX-2, and do not have an effect on COX-1.. Clinical studies have shown that they increase the risk of a heart attack, and of a stroke. Several COX-2 inhibitors have been taken off the market, because of these side-effects.\nOther than as an analgesic, COX-2 inhibitors have also been used in the treatment of cancer, and of some neurological conditions, such as depression, and schizophrenia.\nBecause of the severe side-effects, COX-2 inhibitors are usually only available with a prescription.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Analgesic","surface_form":"analgesic","offset":52},{"uri":"Cyclooxygenase","surface_form":"Cyclooxygenase","offset":63},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":114},{"uri":"Inflammation","surface_form":"inflammation","offset":163},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":180},{"uri":"Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug","surface_form":"NSAIDs","offset":271},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidney","offset":373},{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":422},{"uri":"Stomach","surface_form":"stomach","offset":438},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidney","offset":468},{"uri":"Myocardial_infarction","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":618},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":641},{"uri":"Depression_(mental_illness)","surface_form":"depression","offset":875},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":891},{"uri":"Prescription","surface_form":"prescription","offset":993}]}
