These artists may make an entire album called a \"tribute album\" that is nothing but songs that were first played by other musicians. A \"tribute band\" is a band that only plays songs that were made famous by one other band. They will often dress like that band and try to look like them as they perform. For example, a Kiss tribute band will only play songs by the band Kiss. They will also dress like the band and use the same makeup designs as members of the bands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":16},{"uri":"Contract","surface_form":"contract","offset":220},{"uri":"Ancient_China","surface_form":"Imperial China","offset":370},{"uri":"Regulated","surface_form":"regulated","offset":435},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":445},{"uri":"Goods","surface_form":"goods","offset":454},{"uri":"Service_(economics)","surface_form":"services","offset":464},{"uri":"Great_power","surface_form":"great power","offset":497},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":578},{"uri":"Involved","surface_form":"involved","offset":603},{"uri":"Korea","surface_form":"Joseon","offset":683},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":691},{"uri":"Siam","surface_form":"Siam","offset":698},{"uri":"Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB_Kingdom","surface_form":"Ry\u016Bky\u016B Kingdom","offset":724},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":760},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":787},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":795},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":807},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"\"tribute album\"","offset":902},{"uri":"Dress","surface_form":"dress","offset":1093},{"uri":"Performance","surface_form":"perform","offset":1148},{"uri":"Kiss_(band)","surface_form":"Kiss","offset":1172},{"uri":"Makeup","surface_form":"makeup","offset":1281},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":1288}]}
