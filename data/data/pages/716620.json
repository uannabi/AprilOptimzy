He is professor emeritus of education and humanities at the University of Virginia.\nIn the 1960s Hirsch's \"Validity in Interpretation\" made an important work to contemporary literary theory and he was called \"the founder of contemporary intentionalism\".\nIn popular culture Hirsch is best known for his work on cultural literacy, and is the founder and chairman of the Core Knowledge Foundation.\nHe is a long-term critic of American schools, and promotes ideas for improving the education of children. His \"The Schools We Need: And Why We Don't Have Them\" (1996) was hated by the liberal left. It also managed to annoy the right wing because it attacked the local control of schools. in 2016 he published \" Why Knowledge Matters: Rescuing our Children from Failed Educational Theories\". This outlined three major problems with education in the United States. These are, according to him, the emphasis on teaching skills, such as critical thinking skills, rather than knowledge, individualism rather than communal learning, and developmentalism, that is, teaching children what is \"appropriate\" for their age.\nBeginning in 1990s, Hirsch began publishing books in the \"Core Knowledge Grader Series\" which the Foundation describes as \"an engaging, illustrated guide to the essential knowledge outlined in the Core Knowledge Sequence\". This series of books was received well by parents educating children at home, and it has been adopted by many school systems.\nSol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written extensively on education reform, wrote in 2013 that Hirsch was \"the most important education reformer of the past half-century.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Literary_critic","surface_form":"literary critic","offset":103},{"uri":"University_of_Virginia","surface_form":"University of Virginia","offset":180},{"uri":"Literary_theory","surface_form":"literary theory","offset":294},{"uri":"Authorial_intent","surface_form":"intentionalism","offset":357},{"uri":"Cultural_literacy","surface_form":"cultural literacy","offset":430},{"uri":"Core_Knowledge_Foundation","surface_form":"Core Knowledge Foundation","offset":488},{"uri":"Sol_Stern","surface_form":"Sol Stern","offset":1577},{"uri":"Manhattan_Institute","surface_form":"Manhattan Institute","offset":1611}]}
