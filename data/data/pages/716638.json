{"id":716638,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator","text":"e=\"preserve\">In statistics, an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given amount based on observed data: thus the rule (the estimator), the amount that is being measured (the estimand) and its result (the estimate) are different.\nAn estimator of a parameter formula_1 is often written as formula_1. If the expected value of the estimator is equal to the parameter, then the estimator is called unbiased. Otherwise, it is called biased.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":16},{"uri":"Sample_(statistics)","surface_form":"observed data","offset":106},{"uri":"Estimand","surface_form":"estimand","offset":191}]}
