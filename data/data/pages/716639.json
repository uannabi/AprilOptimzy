{"id":716639,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parameter","text":"e=\"preserve\">A statistical parameter or population parameter is an amount put into the probability distribution of a statistic or a random variable. It can be thought of as a numbered amount of a trait of a statistical population or a statistical model.\nA statistical parameter is different from its estimator in that the parameter is a fixed amount, while the value of an estimator changes according to some probability distribution. The notations formula_1 (for the parameter) and formula_1 (for the estimator) are often used to clarify this distinction.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Probability_distribution","surface_form":"probability distribution","offset":87},{"uri":"Statistic","surface_form":"statistic","offset":117},{"uri":"Random_variable","surface_form":"random variable","offset":132},{"uri":"Statistical_population","surface_form":"statistical population","offset":207},{"uri":"Statistical_model","surface_form":"statistical model","offset":235},{"uri":"Estimator","surface_form":"estimator","offset":300}]}
