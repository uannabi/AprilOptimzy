For formula_1, let\nReasons to use it.\nThe method of moments is simple and gets consistent estimators (under very weak assumptions). However, these estimators are often biased.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":16},{"uri":"Estimation","surface_form":"estimation","offset":65},{"uri":"Statistical_parameter","surface_form":"parameters","offset":90},{"uri":"Consistent_estimator","surface_form":"consistent estimator","offset":272},{"uri":"Bias_of_an_estimator","surface_form":"biased","offset":361}]}
