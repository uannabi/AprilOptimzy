{"id":71701,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape","text":"A landscape means an area of land as one can see it. This includes landforms, flora, fauna and human elements, for instance human activity or the built environment.\nAccording to its meaning, lighting and weather conditions are part of landscape as well. Objects inside the building can sometimes be considered part of landscape as well.\nGeology.\nThe landscape is determined mainly by the underlying geology. This can be seen clearly in the East African Great Rift Valley. There almost everything in the landscape is caused by or connected with the pulling apart of Africa which is happening there. Even in Great Britain, a geologically quiet place, the whole landscape can be understood by understanding its geological past.\nEtymology.\nThe word was borrowed as a painters' term from Dutch during the 16th century, when Dutch artists began to become masters of the landscape genre. The Dutch word \"landschap\" had earlier meant simply \u201Cregion, tract of land\u201D but now meant \u201Ca picture depicting scenery on land\u201D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Landform","surface_form":"landform","offset":67},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":78},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"fauna","offset":85},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":440},{"uri":"Great_Rift_Valley","surface_form":"Great Rift Valley","offset":453},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":606},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":783}]}
