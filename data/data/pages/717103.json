{"id":717103,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Knight_Memorial_Grand_Master_Award","text":"The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. The SFWA gives up to one award each year to a writer of fantasy or science fiction. It started in 1975 when Robert Heinlein became the first SFWA Grand Master. The name Damon Knight was added in 2002. He started the SFWA and died in 2002.\nThe award is given each year at the SFWA Nebula Awards banquet, but it is not one of the Nebulas. Only SFWA officers and past presidents suggest Grand Masters, and the final choice must be approved by a majority of that group. The winner is announced in advance.\nGrand Masters.\nThere have been 34 in the 44 years from 1974/1975 to 2017/2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Writers_of_America","surface_form":"Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America","offset":74},{"uri":"Fantasy","surface_form":"fantasy","offset":178},{"uri":"Science_fiction","surface_form":"science fiction","offset":189},{"uri":"Robert_Heinlein","surface_form":"Robert Heinlein","offset":230},{"uri":"Damon_Knight","surface_form":"Damon Knight","offset":291},{"uri":"Nebula_Awards","surface_form":"Nebula Awards","offset":402}]}
