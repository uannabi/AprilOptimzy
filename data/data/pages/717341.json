{"id":717341,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spit_(landform)","text":"A spit is a stretch of land or sand which projects out to sea. It is joined to the mainland at one end. Spits are created by deposition of sand.\nSpits are formed where the prevailing wind blows at an angle to the coastline, resulting in 'longshore drift'. An example of a spit is Spurn Head, along the Holderness coast in Humberside.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":31},{"uri":"Longshore_drift","surface_form":"longshore drift","offset":238},{"uri":"Humberside","surface_form":"Humberside","offset":322}]}
