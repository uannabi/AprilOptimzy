{"id":7174,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","text":"The president of the United States of America (often shortened to P.O.T.U.S.) is the chief executive of the United States. The office of president was created in the United States Constitution in 1788. The first president (George Washington) took office in 1789. The president is in charge of the executive branch of the United States government. The United States Constitution makes the president the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. It also lists powers given to the President, though these powers have been expanded through practice over time.\nSince the United States began as a slave holding society based on race, every president of the United States has been a white man except for Barack Obama, and at least 12 of the first 18 presidents owned slaves. On November 9, 2016, Donald Trump was elected to be the 45th president of the United States (Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms in office, and is counted as the nation's 22nd and 24th president). There are currently four living former presidents. The most recent death of a former president was the death of George H. W. Bush on November 30, 2018. He was also the most recently serving president to die. The current president was formally inaugurated on January 20, 2017, succeeding Barack Obama.\nElection process and terms.\nThe president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four-year term, and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers, the other being the Vice President of the United States. A president must receive more than 270 electoral college votes in order to win an election. Ronald Reagan received 525 votes which is the most electoral votes of any other president.\nA president can only serve two terms as president, which is eight years. Franklin D. Roosevelt served four terms as president. He died shortly after beginning his fourth term. After his death, Congress passed an amendment that limits the number of terms a president can have.\nWilliam Henry Harrison served the shortest term, one month, because he died in office from pneumonia.\nInaugurations.\nA president officially becomes president after being inaugurated on January 20th. The president must be given the oath of office by the Chief Justice of the United States. It is traditionally held at the United States Capitol.\nSuccession.\nIf the president dies or retires between elections, or is otherwise removed from office, the Acting President will become president, who is usually the Vice President.\nAbraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy were assassinated while in office. William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin Roosevelt died from illness while president. John Tyler was the first Vice President of the United States to become president.\nGerald Ford, Richard Nixon's vice president, became president after Nixon resigned. Nixon is the only president to have resigned.\nAndrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are the only presidents to have been impeached.\nTraveling.\nA president travels by either traveling on Air Force One, Marine One, or by the Presidential state car. At all times, the president is protected by Secret Service agents. Sometimes, the president may travel to Camp David for either relaxation or to do some work in peace.\nPresidential rankings.\nBy a majority of historical sources by historians or by the American people; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton are ranked high on polls.\nOn the other hand; James Buchanan, Warren G. Harding, Herbert Hoover, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and George W. Bush are thought to be the worst.\nPresidential libraries.\nSince Herbert Hoover, each president has created a institutional place known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system.\nThere are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations, such as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois.\nSeveral presidential libraries contain the graves of the president such as Richard Nixon at his library in Yorba Linda, California and Ronald Reagan at his library in Simi Valley, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chief_executive","surface_form":"chief executive","offset":85},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":108},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":127},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":137},{"uri":"United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"United States Constitution","offset":166},{"uri":"George_Washington","surface_form":"George Washington","offset":223},{"uri":"Commander-in-chief","surface_form":"commander-in-chief","offset":402},{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"armed forces","offset":428},{"uri":"Slavery_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"slave holding","offset":589},{"uri":"Race_(sociology)","surface_form":"race","offset":620},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white","offset":674},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":695},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016","surface_form":"November 9, 2016","offset":769},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":787},{"uri":"Grover_Cleveland","surface_form":"Grover Cleveland","offset":859},{"uri":"Living_Presidents_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"living former presidents","offset":1002},{"uri":"George_H._W._Bush","surface_form":"George H.
