{"id":71768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora","text":"In botany, \"flora\" (plural: floras or florae) has two meanings.\nThe first meaning refers to all plant life in an area or time period (especially the naturally occurring or indigenous plant life). The corresponding term for animal life is fauna.\nThe second meaning refers to a \"book or other work\" which describes the plant species in an area or time period, with the aim of allowing identification.\nThe term flora comes from the Latin language. Flora was the goddess of flowers in Roman mythology.\nPlants are grouped into floras based on region, period, special environment, or climate. Regions can be geographically distinct habitats like mountain vs. flatland. Floras can mean plant life of an historic era as in \"fossil flora\".\nBacterial organisms are sometimes included in a flora [http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora] [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm#F]. Other times, the terms \"bacterial flora\" and \"plant flora\" are used separately.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":3},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":20},{"uri":"Indigenous","surface_form":"indigenous","offset":172},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":223},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"fauna","offset":238},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":317},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":323},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":429},{"uri":"Flora_(goddess)","surface_form":"Flora","offset":445},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":459},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":470},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman mythology","offset":481},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":626}]}
