It was originally found around the Mediterranean, but it has spread to most of Europe and the Near East. It has been introduced into the west coasts of Canada, the United States, and Chile.\nStudy organism for evolutionary biology.\n\"D. subobscura\", among others in its species group, is a model organism for evolutionary-biological studies. Its genetics and ecology have been studied for over forty years. \"D. subobscura\" is frequently used in evolutionary-biological studies.\nThey have served as favorable models ever since Dobzhansky and his colleagues published their influential works in the 1930s and 40s. From its discovery in the Palearctic realm to its colonization of North and South America, it has attracted the interests of scientists. It has provided evidence of its evolution, biology, and ecology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fruit_fly","surface_form":"fruit fly","offset":40},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":57},{"uri":"Drosophilidae","surface_form":"Drosophilidae","offset":64},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean","offset":114},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":231},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":243},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":262},{"uri":"Model_organism","surface_form":"model organism","offset":367},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":423},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":436},{"uri":"Dobzhansky","surface_form":"Dobzhansky","offset":603},{"uri":"Palearctic","surface_form":"Palearctic","offset":715},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":858}]}
