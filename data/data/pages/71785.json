{"id":71785,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffyverse","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Buffyverse is a fictional universe created by writer/director Joss Whedon. It is the setting used for the movie \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (BtVS), the \"BtVS\" television series and the \"Angel\" television series. Comic books and novels based on both the Buffy and Angel television series and the Fray comic book also take place in the Buffyverse. The term Buffyverse was created by the fans of the shows and later used by Whedon as the name for his world. The term has also been used in the titles of published works.\nThe Buffyverse is a world where Vampires and demons exist. Many different types of fictional creatures and monsters can be found in this world. These creatures include werewolves, ghosts, trolls, and witches. It is a world where magic is used often. Most of the people in the Buffyverse do not know that these creatures live in this world or that magic exists.\nThe Slayer.\nThe Slayer or \"Chosen One\" is a young girl with super-human strength, agility and stamina. It is her destiny to fight evil. When one Slayer is killed, a new girl is \"chosen\" to become the new Slayer. The new slayer has all of the power of the last Slayer as soon as she is chosen. The new Slayer also begins to have dreams that tell her of her future and Slayers from the past.\nThe first Slayer was created long before written history by a group of men who looked like Aborigine. She was created by combine her with a demon. As each Slayer is killed, the demon moves to the next slayer. It gives her the powers of the Slayer as well as the dreams of its past with the other slayers.\nHellmouth.\nIn the Buffyverse there are many different \"dimensions\" or worlds. Some are full of evil. A place where the borders between the normal world and an evil dimension are weak is called a Hellmouth. Evil in the normal world will naturally move towards a hellmouth. The area closest to a hellmouth will be home to much evil and strange circumstances.\nThere are two well known hellmouths in the Buffyverse. The first is located in Sunnydale, California. This is the place where the stories in \"Buffy\" take place. It is the largest and most powerful hellmouth in the Buffyverse. The second hellmouth is in Cleveland, Ohio. Not much is known about this hellmouth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_universe","surface_form":"fictional universe","offset":33},{"uri":"Screenwriter","surface_form":"writer","offset":63},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"director","offset":70},{"uri":"Joss_Whedon","surface_form":"Joss Whedon","offset":79},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":123},{"uri":"Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(movie)","surface_form":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","offset":130},{"uri":"Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer","surface_form":"BtVS","offset":169},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":175},{"uri":"Angel_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Angel","offset":202},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"Comic book","offset":228},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":244},{"uri":"Fray","surface_form":"Fray","offset":311},{"uri":"Fan","surface_form":"fan","offset":401},{"uri":"Vampire","surface_form":"Vampire","offset":565},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"demon","offset":578},{"uri":"Fiction","surface_form":"fiction","offset":616},{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":626},{"uri":"Monster","surface_form":"monster","offset":640},{"uri":"Werewolf","surface_form":"werewolves","offset":701},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":713},{"uri":"Troll","surface_form":"troll","offset":721},{"uri":"Witch","surface_form":"witch","offset":733},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":762},{"uri":"Superpower","surface_form":"super-human","offset":954},{"uri":"Strength","surface_form":"strength","offset":966},{"uri":"Agility","surface_form":"agility","offset":976},{"uri":"Stamina","surface_form":"stamina","offset":988},{"uri":"Destiny","surface_form":"destiny","offset":1007},{"uri":"Evil","surface_form":"evil","offset":1024},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dream","offset":1222},{"uri":"Writing","surface_form":"written","offset":1325},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":1333},{"uri":"Australian_Aborigine","surface_form":"Aborigine","offset":1375},{"uri":"Circumstance","surface_form":"circumstances","offset":1931},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"stories","offset":2076},{"uri":"Cleveland%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Cleveland, Ohio","offset":2199}]}
