{"id":717891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal","text":"The Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal was a political scandal in the United States.\nIn October 2019, a whistleblower anonymously complained that U.S. President Donald Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and other high-ranking Trump administration members had made phonecalls with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, asking him to have the Ukrainian government investigate Joe Biden, who was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic primaries at the time; as well as his son Hunter Biden, in exchange for keeping U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The complaint raised concerns that Trump was asking for other countries to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.\nThe controversy led to an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Because of the scandal, Trump was formally impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 18, 2019. However, the Senate voted to clear Trump of charges.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Political_scandal","surface_form":"political scandal","offset":32},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":148},{"uri":"Rudy_Giuliani","surface_form":"Rudy Giuliani","offset":173},{"uri":"President_of_Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainian president","offset":265},{"uri":"Volodymyr_Zelensky","surface_form":"Volodymyr Zelensky","offset":285},{"uri":"Joe_Biden","surface_form":"Joe Biden","offset":361},{"uri":"2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries","surface_form":"2020 Democratic primaries","offset":399},{"uri":"Hunter_Biden","surface_form":"Hunter Biden","offset":457},{"uri":"2020_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"2020 presidential election","offset":617},{"uri":"Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump","surface_form":"impeachment inquiry against Trump","offset":671},{"uri":"Impeachment_of_Donald_Trump","surface_form":"impeached","offset":749},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"U.S. House of Representatives","offset":766},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":831},{"uri":"Impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump","surface_form":"voted","offset":838}]}
