She was an aquanaut on the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations 5 (NEEMO 5) crew in June 2003.\nEarly life.\nHwang was born in Taiwan on 21 July 1970. She moved with her family to the United States at the age of two. Most of her early education was in Texas.\nEducation.\nHwang received her bachelor\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. Hwang moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan to attend graduate school at the University of Michigan where she earned two master's degrees. One was in biomedical engineering and the other in electrical engineering. While in graduate school, she also became a teacher in the martial arts of Aikido and Iaido.\nCareer.\nHwang joined Wyle Laboratories in September 2001. At first she worked as a scientist in the sensors group. This work included research for monitoring the health of cell cultures on the space shuttle or station. In 2002 she moved to the neurosciences group. This group studies the effects of space flight on astronauts, with a focus on helping them adapt to space and their return to Earth. In 2011, Hwang moved to the Integrated Science & Engineering (ISE) group.\nNEEMO 5.\nIn June 2003, Hwang became an aquanaut in the NASA andNOAA, NEEMO 5 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) project. This was held in Aquarius, the world's only undersea research laboratory. NEEMO 5 was the longest NEEMO mission to that date. The crew lived underwater for fourteen days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":19},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":34},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":49},{"uri":"Aquanaut","surface_form":"aquanaut","offset":75},{"uri":"NEEMO","surface_form":"NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations","offset":91},{"uri":"June_16%E2%80%9329%2C_2003","surface_form":"NEEMO 5","offset":138},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":196},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":253},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":321},{"uri":"Bachelor%E2%80%99s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor\u2019s degree","offset":358},{"uri":"Biomedical_engineering","surface_form":"biomedical engineering","offset":379},{"uri":"Boston_University","surface_form":"Boston University","offset":405},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":426},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":434},{"uri":"Ann_Arbor%2C_Michigan","surface_form":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","offset":464},{"uri":"Graduate_school","surface_form":"graduate school","offset":494},{"uri":"University_of_Michigan","surface_form":"University of Michigan","offset":517},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"master's degree","offset":561},{"uri":"Biomedical_engineering","surface_form":"biomedical engineering","offset":590},{"uri":"Electrical_engineering","surface_form":"electrical engineering","offset":630},{"uri":"Martial_arts","surface_form":"martial arts","offset":713},{"uri":"Aikido","surface_form":"Aikido","offset":729},{"uri":"Iaido","surface_form":"Iaido","offset":740},{"uri":"Wyle_Laboratories","surface_form":"Wyle Laboratories","offset":768},{"uri":"Sensor","surface_form":"sensor","offset":847},{"uri":"Cell_culture","surface_form":"cell culture","offset":919},{"uri":"Space_shuttle","surface_form":"space shuttle","offset":940},{"uri":"Space_station","surface_form":"station","offset":957},{"uri":"Neuroscience","surface_form":"neuroscience","offset":991},{"uri":"Astronaut","surface_form":"astronaut","offset":1062},{"uri":"Aquanaut","surface_form":"aquanaut","offset":1258},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":1274},{"uri":"NOAA","surface_form":"NOAA","offset":1282},{"uri":"June_16%E2%80%9329%2C_2003","surface_form":"NEEMO 5","offset":1288},{"uri":"Aquarius_(laboratory)","surface_form":"Aquarius","offset":1368},{"uri":"Underwater_habitat","surface_form":"undersea research laboratory","offset":1395},{"uri":"NEEMO","surface_form":"NEEMO","offset":1449}]}
