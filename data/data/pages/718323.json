{"id":718323,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9420_Chilean_protests","text":"Many civil protests against poverty are taking place in several cities in Chile. The protests began in the capital Santiago as a campaign by secondary school students to avoid paying the Metro de Santiago subway in response to recent price hikes, leading to multiple takeovers of the city's main train stations.\nThis had led to open confrontations with the national police (Carabineros).\nOn 18 October, the situation escalated as organized bands of protesters rose in rebellion across the city, taking control of many terminals of the Santiago Metro network (part of \"Red\") and disabling them with extensive infrastructure damage. The Metro network was disabled in its entirety.\nOn 18 October, President of Chile Sebasti\u00E1n Pi\u00F1era announced a state of emergency, sending Chilean Army forces across the main regions to enforce order and crack down on the destruction of public property because of privatization.\nA curfew was declared on 19 October in the Greater Santiago area, for the first time since 1987, at the end of the Pinochet dictatorship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":28},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":74},{"uri":"Santiago%2C_Chile","surface_form":"Santiago","offset":115},{"uri":"Secondary_school","surface_form":"secondary school","offset":141},{"uri":"Fare_evasion","surface_form":"avoid paying","offset":170},{"uri":"Santiago_Metro","surface_form":"Metro de Santiago","offset":187},{"uri":"Carabineros_de_Chile","surface_form":"Carabineros","offset":374},{"uri":"Red_Metropolitana_de_Movilidad","surface_form":"Red","offset":568},{"uri":"President_of_Chile","surface_form":"President of Chile","offset":694},{"uri":"Sebasti%C3%A1n_Pi%C3%B1era","surface_form":"Sebasti\u00E1n Pi\u00F1era","offset":713},{"uri":"Emergency","surface_form":"emergency","offset":751},{"uri":"Chilean_Army","surface_form":"Chilean Army","offset":770},{"uri":"Privatization","surface_form":"privatization","offset":895},{"uri":"Curfew","surface_form":"curfew","offset":912},{"uri":"Augusto_Pinochet","surface_form":"Pinochet dictatorship","offset":1025}]}
