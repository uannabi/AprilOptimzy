{"id":718469,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm","text":"=\"preserve\">Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithmic computing process for cryptography. Basically, it solves the following problem: Given an integer formula_1, find its prime factors.\nIts effectiveness may eventually undermine the security of the important RSA encryption device.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":42},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime factor","offset":171},{"uri":"RSA_algorithm","surface_form":"RSA","offset":259},{"uri":"Encryption","surface_form":"encryption","offset":263}]}
