{"id":71895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift","text":"e=\"preserve\">Genetic drift is a random effect on biological populations. Its effect is to remove genetic variation from a population of living organisms.\nIn natural populations there are a number of forces acting. There are forces which add heritable variation to the population, such as mutation and recombination. There are also factors which remove variation from the population, and drift is one of these.\nOverview.\nIn a species, or an interbreeding population, there is usually a great deal of genetic variation. This genetic variation is in the form of different alleles at many loci (gene positions) on the chromosomes.\nChanges in allele frequency are mainly caused by natural selection, that is, by differential survival, and contribution to the next generation. But as populations get smaller, there is a tendency for each generation to become more homozygous, with less variety of alleles. This is an effect similar to inbreeding: it leads to genetic uniformity.\nGenetic drift is the name given to this loss of variation. It can affect evolution in surprisingly big ways, but \"only when populations are quite small\". What 'small' means would depend on the organism. 50 individuals is small, 5000 is not, 500 is maybe. The basic mechanism of drift is that genetic variety is reduced by chance, making the individuals more similar to each other, and hence more vulnerable.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":32},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":60},{"uri":"Genetic","surface_form":"genetic","offset":97},{"uri":"Variation_(biology)","surface_form":"variation","offset":105},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":143},{"uri":"Heritable","surface_form":"heritable","offset":241},{"uri":"Mutation","surface_form":"mutation","offset":288},{"uri":"Recombination","surface_form":"recombination","offset":301},{"uri":"Allele","surface_form":"allele","offset":569},{"uri":"Allele","surface_form":"loci","offset":585},{"uri":"Chromosome","surface_form":"chromosome","offset":614},{"uri":"Allele_frequency","surface_form":"allele frequency","offset":638},{"uri":"Natural_selection","surface_form":"natural selection","offset":676},{"uri":"Homozygous","surface_form":"homozygous","offset":858},{"uri":"Inbreeding","surface_form":"inbreeding","offset":929}]}
