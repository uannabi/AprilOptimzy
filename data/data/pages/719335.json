{"id":719335,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Liberal_Party_(Brazil)","text":"The Social Liberal Party (; often abbreviated as PSL) is a right-wing conservative party in Brazil. Until 2018, the main ideology followed by the party was social-liberalism, however, with the membership of the controversial congressman Jair Bolsonaro, the party shifted its political positions to more right-wing and conservative-oriented ones, namely economic liberalism, liberalism, monarchism and anti-communism.\nThe party was founded on October 30, 1994. Its current president is Luciano Bivar.\nIn the 2018 Presidential elections in Brazil, the party won through Jair Bolsonaro, defeating far-left rival Fernando Haddad, a member of the Workers' Party, thus making Bolsonaro the President-elected of Brazil. He received more support from Evangelical Christians, the middle-class, farmers, as well as from people in South Brazil.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":59},{"uri":"Conservatism","surface_form":"conservative","offset":70},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":92},{"uri":"2018","surface_form":"2018","offset":106},{"uri":"Social_liberalism","surface_form":"social-liberalism","offset":156},{"uri":"Jair_Bolsonaro","surface_form":"Jair Bolsonaro","offset":237},{"uri":"Economic_liberalism","surface_form":"economic liberalism","offset":353},{"uri":"Liberalism","surface_form":"liberalism","offset":374},{"uri":"Monarchism","surface_form":"monarchism","offset":386},{"uri":"Anti-communism","surface_form":"anti-communism","offset":401},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":442},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":454},{"uri":"Luciano_Bivar","surface_form":"Luciano Bivar","offset":485},{"uri":"2018_Brazilian_general_election","surface_form":"2018 Presidential elections in Brazil","offset":507},{"uri":"Fernando_Haddad","surface_form":"Fernando Haddad","offset":609},{"uri":"Workers%27_Party_(Brazil)","surface_form":"Workers' Party","offset":642},{"uri":"Evangelicalism","surface_form":"Evangelical","offset":743},{"uri":"Middle-class","surface_form":"middle-class","offset":771},{"uri":"Farmers","surface_form":"farmers","offset":785},{"uri":"South_Brazil","surface_form":"South Brazil","offset":820}]}
