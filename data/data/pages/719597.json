It is also the county seat of Brown County. In 2010, 3,172 people lived there.\nHistory.\nHiawatha was created in 1857. This makes it one of the oldest towns in Kansas. John M. Coe, John P. Wheller, and Thomas J. Drummond were important in creating the city, and the place was found on February 17, 1857. B.L. Rider was responsible for naming Hiawatha. It was named after Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, \"The Song of Hiawatha\". Hiawatha became the Brown County Seat in 1858. The first school opened in 1870.\nThe main street was called Oregon Street after the Oregon Trail. Parallel streets north of it were named after Indian tribes north of the Trail, and streets south carried tribal names of those south of the Trail.\nHiawatha is named after a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called \"The Song of Hiawatha\". The Onondaga and Mohawk Indian leader Hiawatha is in the poem.
