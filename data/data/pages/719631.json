{"id":719631,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%A1para_People","text":"ce=\"preserve\">S\u00E1para people, also Z\u00E1para people or S\u00E1paros, are natives of the Amazon rainforest. They have lived around the border of Peru and Ecuador long before the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Their oral traditions and expressions were declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Since 2009, the S\u00E1para people are a Nation inside of the Republic of Ecuador.\nPopulation and Territory.\nAbout 480 S\u00E1paros live in 400,000 hectares of Amazonian territory between the Conambo and Pinduyacu rivers, and between the rivers Curaray and Napo inside of the Yasuni National Park in Ecuador. There are also a hundred S\u00E1paros living in two towns, Arabelas and Iquitos, near the river Tigre in Peru. Most of the S\u00E1para territory is located within these coordinates: latitude: -2.2186; longitude: -76.5087. <mapframe latitude=\"-2.2186\" longitude=\"-76.5087\" zoom=\"10\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" align=\"right\" />The S\u00E1para people are the smallest native group in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The population has decreased from about 200,000 people in the 16th century to almost 500 in the second decade of the 21st century. They live in the Ecuadorian towns of Kuitza (Llanchamacocha), Aremano (Jandiayacu), Mazaraka (Mazaramu), Cuyacocha, and Akamaru.\nOrigin and Culture.\nIn Kichwa language, \"Z\u00E1paro\" means a basket made of \"bejuco\", a tropical woody vine while in the Zaparo language, the word \"Z\u00E1para\" means person of the forest. The spelling of the Nation\u2019s name has been changed to \"S\u00E1para\" because the Z sound does not exist in the language of the S\u00E1paras.\nThe S\u00E1paras consider their lands, language and spirituality the three main aspects of their identity.\nTheir dress is mainly a vest made out of a bark from the Llanchama tree and a feather headdress.\nSome S\u00E1paras have married persons from other tribes such as the Kichwa, Shuar, and Achuar. However, the people still identify themselves as S\u00E1para. S\u00E1paras have become confused with their neighbors because the young people speak Kichwa and because of their low population. In fact, in the mid-1970s, the Z\u00E1para were declared extinct in Ecuador, while in Per\u00FA, they were unknown before 2001 although they appeared on the language map of the country.\nBeliefs.\nThe S\u00E1para people do not have a religion. Their mythology and stories develop from their environment. Dreams and the spiritual role of Amazonian animals are important for S\u00E1paras when making decisions.\nDuring the 20th century, missionaries came to the rainforest to convert native people to Christianity. The S\u00E1paras have refused these outside influences. Even when speaking Spanish, some leaders prefer not to use vocabulary related to western ideas, such as the word \"devil\".\nLanguage.\nZaparoan, or \"Saparoan\", is a family of languages. Within this group, there are five separate languages: Coronado, Omurano, Andoa, Gae and \"Z\u00E1paro\". More than a dozen extinct tribes spoke the Zaparoan languages. The only Zaparoan languages and dialects alive in modern times are Iquitos, Sabela and Z\u00E1paro. Iquitos is spoken by 500 people in Peru and the dialect Sabela is spoken by approximately 100 people in Ecuador.\nThe Z\u00E1paro language is spoken, in Ecuador, by 9 S\u00E1paras, elders who are over 60 years\".\" Most of the S\u00E1para people speak Kichwa, the largest native language in South America, as their mother tongue. In the 20th century, they also started to speak Spanish.\nDeclarations.\nEcuador and Per\u00FA suggested including the language and cultural expressions of the S\u00E1para people in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee made the declaration in November 2008.\nOrganization and Government.\nThe S\u00E1para people became the Z\u00E1para Nationality of Ecuador in 2003. In the beginning, the S\u00E1para organization, NAZAE, represented the towns of Llanchamacocha, Jandiayacu, Mazaramu, and one family in Cuyacocha. Since 2005, the Nation includes the towns of Shiona, Pindoyacu, Balsaura and San Jos\u00E9 del Curaray.\nIn 2009, the S\u00E1para people were of\uFB01cially recognized as the S\u00E1para Nation or NASE by the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONFENIAE), and the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE). Because of their distinction, the S\u00E1para Nation became member of the executive board of the Development Council of Nationalities and Peoples of Ecuador, CODENPE.\nThreats and Political problems.\nThe S\u00E1para population decreased because of diseases, forced migrations, and slavery. Diseases brought by rubber companies and religious missionaries reduced the S\u00E1para people to one group. The people also were separated from each other when their land was divided in 1941 during the war between Ecuador and Peru.\nThe S\u00E1para Nation have asked for rights such as health and bilingual education, in addition to demanding the Government of Ecuador to help them to keep their language alive. The S\u00E1paras are concerned about their right to own the land where they have lived for centuries and about protecting the environment from the actions of oil, timber and pharmaceutical companies.\nEconomy.\nThe S\u00E1paras have been fishers, hunters, gatherers and farmers. During the 1940\u2019s, the S\u00E1paras started to move to cities for study and work. At the same time, S\u00E1para men were drafted into the Army. They also left their communities to work for the Shell Oil Company and large plantations. Around 2007, men used to go to the Ecuadorian coast to work for construction companies. Meanwhile, women stayed in the villages taking care of the children, keeping the house and farming. As a result of such migration, most S\u00E1para men have learned Spanish.\nEducation.\nS\u00E1para people have two different education systems, the mainstream educational system and the Intercultural Bilingual Education System of the Governmental Education Division of Ecuador. While some S\u00E1paras have moved to cities to attend Spanish-language high schools, others attend Kichwa-language schools located in their villages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amazon_rainforest","surface_form":"Amazon rainforest","offset":79},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":135},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":144},{"uri":"Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas","surface_form":"Spanish colonization of the Americas","offset":168},{"uri":"Oral_tradition","surface_form":"oral traditions","offset":212},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":305},{"uri":"Nation","surface_form":"Nation","offset":349},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":382},{"uri":"Hectare","surface_form":"hectares","offset":451},{"uri":"Conambo","surface_form":"Conambo","offset":495},{"uri":"Pinduyacu","surface_form":"Pinduyacu","offset":507},{"uri":"Curaray","surface_form":"Curaray","offset":548},{"uri":"Napo_river","surface_form":"Napo","offset":560},{"uri":"Yasuni_National_Park","surface_form":"Yasuni National Park","offset":579},{"uri":"Arabelas","surface_form":"Arabelas","offset":666},{"uri":"Iquitos","surface_form":"Iquitos","offset":679},{"uri":"Latitude","surface_form":"latitude","offset":784},{"uri":"Longitude","surface_form":"longitude","offset":803},{"uri":"Woody_vine","surface_form":"woody vine","offset":1352},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythology","offset":2274},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":2517},{"uri":"Devil","surface_form":"devil","offset":2696},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":3069},{"uri":"Quechua","surface_form":"Kichwa","offset":3255},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"native language","offset":3275},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":3294},{"uri":"Representative_List_of_the_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_of_Humanity","surface_form":"Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity","offset":3507},{"uri":"The_Confederation_of_Indigenous_Nationalities_of_Ecuador","surface_form":"the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador","offset":4151},{"uri":"Migration","surface_form":"migrations","offset":4472},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavery","offset":4488},{"uri":"The_1941_war_between_Ecuador_and_Peru","surface_form":"the war between Ecuador and Peru","offset":4691},{"uri":"Lumber","surface_form":"timber","offset":5057},{"uri":"Shell_Oil_Company","surface_form":"Shell Oil Company","offset":5349},{"uri":"Mainstream","surface_form":"mainstream","offset":5714}]}
