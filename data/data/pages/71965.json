{"id":71965,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Jeunet","text":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet (born 3 September 1953 in Roanne, Loire, France) is a French movie director.\nCareer.\nJean-Pierre Jeunet bought his first camera at the age of 17 and made short movies while studying animation at Cin\u00E9mation Studios. He made friends with Marc Caro. Caro was a designer and comic book artist. Caro worked on many of Jeunet's movies with him.\nTogether, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live-action movie was \"The Bunker of the Last Gunshots\" (1981). It was a short movie about soldiers in a futuristic world. Jeunet also directed numerous television advertisements and music videos.\nJeunet and Caro's first full length movie was \"Delicatessen\" (1991). It was a black comedy set in a famine-plagued future. Next came \"The City of Lost Children\" (1995). It was a dark fantasy movie with a story about a doctor who kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams.\nBecause \"The City of Lost Children\" was well liked, Jeunet was asked to direct the fourth movie in the Alien series - ' (1997). Though not well received by critics, \"Alien: Resurrection\" turned a profit at the box office.\nJeunet returned to France after making \"Alien: Resurrection\". The fact that he had made a Hollywood movie gave him freedom on his next movie, \"Am\u00E9lie\". \"Am\u00E9lie\" is lighter and more romantic than his earlier movies. This story was a huge success worldwide. It was nominated for several Academy Awards. For this movie he also got an European Film Award for Best Director.\nIn 2004, Jeunet released \"A Very Long Engagement\". It is based on the novel by Sebastien Japrisot. The movie is set after World War I. It is about a woman (played by Audrey Tautou) looking for her missing lover.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Actor"],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_3","surface_form":"3 September","offset":25},{"uri":"1953","surface_form":"1953","offset":37},{"uri":"Roanne","surface_form":"Roanne","offset":45},{"uri":"Loire","surface_form":"Loire","offset":53},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":60},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":73},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"movie director","offset":80},{"uri":"Camera","surface_form":"camera","offset":140},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":179},{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animation","offset":201},{"uri":"Cin%C3%A9mation_Studios","surface_form":"Cin\u00E9mation Studios","offset":214},{"uri":"Marc_Caro","surface_form":"Marc Caro","offset":255},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":290},{"uri":"Award-","surface_form":"award-","offset":393},{"uri":"Live-action","surface_form":"live-action","offset":431},{"uri":"The_Bunker_of_the_Last_Gunshots","surface_form":"The Bunker of the Last Gunshots","offset":454},{"uri":"1981","surface_form":"1981","offset":488},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":522},{"uri":"Future","surface_form":"futuristic","offset":536},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":584},{"uri":"Advertisement","surface_form":"advertisement","offset":595},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":614},{"uri":"Delicatessen_(movie)","surface_form":"Delicatessen","offset":675},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":690},{"uri":"Black_comedy","surface_form":"black comedy","offset":706},{"uri":"Famine","surface_form":"famine","offset":728},{"uri":"The_City_of_Lost_Children","surface_form":"The City of Lost Children","offset":762},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":790},{"uri":"Fantasy_movie","surface_form":"fantasy movie","offset":811},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"story","offset":832},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":846},{"uri":"Kidnap","surface_form":"kidnap","offset":857},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dream","offset":898},{"uri":"Alien_(movie)","surface_form":"Alien","offset":1009},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":1027},{"uri":"Movie_criticism","surface_form":"critics","offset":1062},{"uri":"Movie_theatre","surface_form":"box office","offset":1116},{"uri":"Hollywood%2C_California","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":1218},{"uri":"Freedom","surface_form":"freedom","offset":1243},{"uri":"Am%C3%A9lie","surface_form":"Am\u00E9lie","offset":1271},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"romantic","offset":1309},{"uri":"Nominate","surface_form":"nominated","offset":1391},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":1413},{"uri":"European_Film_Awards","surface_form":"European Film Award","offset":1459},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":1501},{"uri":"A_Very_Long_Engagement","surface_form":"A Very Long Engagement","offset":1524},{"uri":"Sebastien_Japrisot","surface_form":"Sebastien Japrisot","offset":1577},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1620},{"uri":"Audrey_Tautou","surface_form":"Audrey Tautou","offset":1664},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":1703}]}
