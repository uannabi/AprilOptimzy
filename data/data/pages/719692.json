{"id":719692,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimbanguism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kimbanguism is an African religion practiced by the \"Church of Jesus Christ on Earth through his prophet\" Simon Kimbangu. It has roots in Christianity and has its headquarters in N'kamba in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nHistory.\nIn April 1921, during the Belgian colonization in Congo, Simon Kimbangu started preaching to people and using the powers that he believed he had received from God in visions to heal people. During his ministry, he attracted a large group of people. Under pressure from the Catholic Church, who was afraid of the popularity of the movement, the Belgian authorities tried to arrest Kimbangu on June 09, 1921. They failed in arresting him, and Kimbangu escaped. He continued his ministry in secret before turning himself in on September 12, 1921. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was changed to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1951.\nDuring Kimbangu\u2019s imprisonment, Kimbanguism was prohibited, but the followers continued to practice it. It grew through the leadership of Kimbangu\u2019s wife, Muile Marie, and his son, Joseph Diangenda. After Kimbangu\u2019s death, the movement was recognized as a religion by the Belgian authorities in 1959 and became a member of the World Council of Churches in 1969. The church was led by Kimbangu\u2019s youngest son, Joseph Diangenda Kuntima, until his death in 2001. Since 2001, Kimbangu\u2019s grandson, Simon Kimbangu Kiangani, has become the spiritual leader.\nBelief and Practices.\nSimon Kimbangu is an inspirational figure and he is considered the Black Messiah by his followers.\nThree dates are important in Kimbanguist beliefs: April 6 (the start of the ministry of healing), May 25 (Christmas), and October 12 (Kimbangu\u2019s death anniversary). Kimbanguism has roots in Christianity and the Bible. However, it has developed its own beliefs.\nThe basic principles of the Kimbanguist church are Bolingo (Love in English), Mibeko (Laws in English), and Misala (Works in English). According to Kimbanguist beliefs, Simon Kimbangu is God the Holy Spirit. Charles Kisolokele, his first son, is God the Father. Salomon Dialungana, his second son, is believed to be Jesus Christ who has come back in our times. Joseph Diangenda, his third son, is the reincarnation of his Father, the Holy Spirit.\nAccording to\u00A0 Kimbanguist rules, polygamy, smoking, drugs, alcohol, eating pork, sleeping naked, and trading on Sundays are all forbidden. During the Sunday services, believers do not wear shoes in the church. Green and white are the colors used in Kimbanguism. Green represents hope and white represents integrity. The churches are painted in these colors, and the believers wear them almost every day. The Kimbanguist has its headquarters in N'kamba, the hometown of Simon Kimbangu, which is considered \u201Cthe New Jerusalem.\u201D\nOrganization.\nKimbanguism has expanded outside of the Congo. Some smaller communities are in other central African countries, as well as Belgium, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nThe spiritual leader is the supreme authority of the church. He is followed by the elders, who are the highest level of the Kimbanguist clergy. National and regional representatives make the second level of the leadership of the church. Decisions are made by the elders during meetings of representatives from the congregations. The Kimbanguist Church has its headquarters in N'kamba, the hometown of Simon Kimbangu, which is considered \u201Cthe New Jerusalem.\u201D Baptism is required to become a member of the church.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Simon_Kimbangu","surface_form":"Simon Kimbangu","offset":119},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":151},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":176},{"uri":"Nkamba","surface_form":"N'kamba","offset":192},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of Congo.","offset":207},{"uri":"Belgian_colonization_in_Congo","surface_form":"Belgian colonization in Congo","offset":272},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":519},{"uri":"New_Jerusalem","surface_form":"New Jerusalem","offset":2785},{"uri":"Clergy","surface_form":"clergy","offset":3142}]}
