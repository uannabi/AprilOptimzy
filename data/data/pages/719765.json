{"id":719765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_the_Insult_Comic_Dog","text":"Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is a puppet character puppeteered and voiced by Robert Smigel, best known for mocking celebrities in an Eastern European accent.\nAs his name means, Triumph's comedic style is almost exclusively insult comedy. Triumph often puffs a cigar, which usually falls out of his mouth when he starts talking. He debuted in 1997 on NBC's \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and also appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\". He now appears on \"Conan\", and Adult Swim's \"The Jack and Triumph Show\".\nSmigel and Triumph have been kicked out from several events for Triumph's antics, including Westminster (three times), the Honolulu line for auditions for \"American Idol\", and the 2004 Democratic National Convention (while shooting an aborted movie project).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puppet","surface_form":"puppet","offset":34},{"uri":"Robert_Smigel","surface_form":"Robert Smigel","offset":77},{"uri":"Eastern_Europe","surface_form":"Eastern Europe","offset":133},{"uri":"Insult_comedy","surface_form":"insult comedy","offset":223},{"uri":"Cigar","surface_form":"cigar","offset":260},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":350},{"uri":"Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien","surface_form":"Late Night with Conan O'Brien","offset":357},{"uri":"The_Tonight_Show_with_Conan_O%27Brien","surface_form":"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien","offset":410},{"uri":"Conan_(talk_show)","surface_form":"Conan","offset":467},{"uri":"Adult_Swim","surface_form":"Adult Swim","offset":479},{"uri":"The_Jack_and_Triumph_Show","surface_form":"The Jack and Triumph Show","offset":493},{"uri":"American_Idol","surface_form":"American Idol","offset":677},{"uri":"2004_Democratic_National_Convention","surface_form":"2004 Democratic National Convention","offset":701}]}
