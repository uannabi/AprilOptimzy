{"id":720045,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene_Islands","text":"The Mascarene Islands, () or Mascarenes, is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar.\nThey include Mauritius, R\u00E9union and Rodrigues. Their name comes from the Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas, who first visited them in April 1512.\nThe islands were formed by the volcanism of the R\u00E9union hotspot beneath the Mascarene Plateau. They are a distinct ecoregion with a unique flora and fauna.\nExtinct animals include the dodo (a flightless pigeon), and the Rodgrigues solitaire. The islands also had giant tortoises, and still has some endemic birds and reptiles.\nBefore the ships found the islands, the islands had no humans. Now they have many people, and the original ecology of the islands is being destroyed.\nThe Mascarene Islands are a French overseas department. Mauritius styles itself the Republic of Mauritius, and is self-governed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":55},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":70},{"uri":"Madagascar","surface_form":"Madagascar","offset":91},{"uri":"Mauritius","surface_form":"Mauritius","offset":116},{"uri":"R%C3%A9union","surface_form":"R\u00E9union","offset":127},{"uri":"Rodrigues","surface_form":"Rodrigues","offset":139},{"uri":"Portuguese_people","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":176},{"uri":"Pedro_Mascarenhas","surface_form":"Pedro Mascarenhas","offset":197},{"uri":"Volcanism","surface_form":"volcanism","offset":285},{"uri":"R%C3%A9union_hotspot","surface_form":"R\u00E9union hotspot","offset":302},{"uri":"Mascarene_Plateau","surface_form":"Mascarene Plateau","offset":330},{"uri":"Ecoregion","surface_form":"ecoregion","offset":369},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":393},{"uri":"Fauna","surface_form":"fauna","offset":403},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"Extinct","offset":410},{"uri":"Dodo","surface_form":"dodo","offset":438},{"uri":"Rodgrigues_solitaire","surface_form":"Rodgrigues solitaire","offset":474},{"uri":"Tortoises","surface_form":"tortoises","offset":523},{"uri":"Endemic","surface_form":"endemic","offset":553},{"uri":"French","surface_form":"French","offset":759}]}
