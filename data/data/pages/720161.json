They order a large vodka tonic and a pint of cider. Then ten of the bikers from the beginning come in and shoot the bar with the crossbow. One then offers to show Kim his \"chopper\" while she is playing pool. She declines, claiming not to have brought her magnifying glass. He then takes an axe and attacks the pool table.

It is then seen that the inspector is looking at some heads. Noddy then goes to a priest. The priest also has a motorcycle. They travel to the garage where the bike is kept. The priest is sarcastic. He does not believe Noddy. Not wanting to be taken into the sunlight, the bike uses its brake lever to cut off the priest's fingers. Determining the bike is a vampire, the priest decides to do an exorcism. Believing the bike will come back for Kim, the priest gives her some garlic.\nThe vampire bike disables the bike Noddy and the priest are riding. They wait for a bus. It is a race against the sun to get to the vampire bike before nightfall. During the exorcism, the priest is hit in the head with a spanner. Noddy is blown around the room by a mysterious wind, knocking him into cupboards. The priest is then crucified with a crown of barbed wire. The priest sprinkles holy water. This makes the bike angry. It grows spikes and glows red.\nNoddy runs off and steals a police motorcycle. He drags the policeman behind him. The policeman is almost run over by the vampire bike. The bike is chased by a police car. The priest attempts to explain it to the authorities. Kim is washed removing her garlic. The bike evades the police by driving vertically down a wall. It goes to the hospital to finish off Kim. It cuts the tea lady in two. Kim uses her crucifix to scare it away. The motorbike goes after Roach. Roach crashes and lands in a coffin. He is presumed dead.\nThe bike then goes for Noddy but gets its front wheel stuck in a bridge. Noddy throws it in a river. Thinking he is safe, Noddy has a victory smoke. The audience sees a red-light under the water. Noddy then sees it and screams. He runs around like a lunatic. He hides in a gym. The bike doesn't take long to find him. It starts attacking the patrons with its spikes. Noddy then bashes the bike. It pretends to die. Everyone feels safe, until it starts throwing people's limbs in the air. The inspector scares it with his smell. The bike manages to trap Noddy against a wall. Noddy turns on a sun bed. Everyone uses their crucifix and/or garlic breath to force it into the light and it melts. Kim asks how much Noddy really spent on the bike. The priest says they are usually reliable. Back in Noddy's workshop, he accidentally cuts his hand. The blood drips onto the bike's old fuel tank which springs open, leaving the audience expecting a sequel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Horror_comedy_(genre)","surface_form":"comedy horror","offset":53},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":75},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"evil spirit","offset":131},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham, England","offset":169},{"uri":"Motorcycle_courier","surface_form":"motorcycle courier","offset":259},{"uri":"Motorbike","surface_form":"motorbike","offset":317},{"uri":"Norton_Commando","surface_form":"Norton Commando","offset":337},{"uri":"Motorbike_gang","surface_form":"motorbike gang","offset":497},{"uri":"Hells_Angels","surface_form":"Hells Angels","offset":607},{"uri":"Michael_Elphick","surface_form":"Michael Elphick","offset":621},{"uri":"Anthony_Daniels","surface_form":"Anthony Daniels","offset":662},{"uri":"Priest","surface_form":"priest","offset":697},{"uri":"Motorbike_gang","surface_form":"motorbike gang","offset":794},{"uri":"Crossbow","surface_form":"crossbow","offset":835},{"uri":"Girlfriend","surface_form":"girlfriend","offset":1052},{"uri":"Public_house","surface_form":"pub","offset":1540},{"uri":"Cue_sports","surface_form":"pool","offset":1747},{"uri":"Magnifying_glass","surface_form":"magnifying glass","offset":1800},{"uri":"Axe","surface_form":"axe","offset":1835},{"uri":"Crucifix","surface_form":"crucifix","offset":2258},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":2640},{"uri":"Vampire","surface_form":"vampire","offset":3078},{"uri":"Garlic","surface_form":"garlic","offset":3194},{"uri":"Spanner","surface_form":"spanner","offset":3423},{"uri":"Policeman","surface_form":"policeman","offset":3723},{"uri":"Police_car","surface_form":"police car","offset":3823},{"uri":"Coffin","surface_form":"coffin","offset":4159}]}
