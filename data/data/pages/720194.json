It is called the \"Tomb of Jesus\" (\"Kirisuto no haka\"). It's also where Jesus' last descendants, the family of Sajiro Sawaguchi, lives. The Sawaguchi family says that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead, his brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross. Jesus left, and he went through Siberia to Mutsu Province (in northern Japan). Once in Japan, he changed his name to Torai Tora Daitenku. He became a rice farmer, and he married a twenty-year old Japanese woman named Miyuko. He raised three daughters near what is now Shing\u014D. While in Japan, he supposedly traveled around. He supposedly died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. Jesus' bones were collected, bundled, and buried in the mound said to be the grave of Jesus Christ.\nAnother mound near the supposed grave of Jesus is said to have an ear of the brother of Jesus. It is also said to have some hair from Mary, the mother of Jesus. They were the only things from his family that Jesus could carry when he left Judaea. The claims started in 1933 after the people found supposed \"ancient Hebrew documents about Jesus' life and death in Japan.\" They were supposedly the from Jesus. These documents are called the Takeuchi Documents. They are said to be very old documents that were passed down through the family of Takeuchi Kiyomaro. The documents were supposedly taken by the Japanese authorities, and the documents were taken to Tokyo, shortly before World War II. They have not been seen since.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_villages_in_Japan","surface_form":"village","offset":5},{"uri":"Aomori_Prefecture","surface_form":"Aomori Prefecture","offset":16},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":35},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":87},{"uri":"Lake_Towada","surface_form":"Lake Towada","offset":182},{"uri":"Akita_Prefecture","surface_form":"Akita Prefecture","offset":291},{"uri":"Humid_continental_climate","surface_form":"Humid continental climate","offset":332},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":442},{"uri":"Aomori_Prefecture","surface_form":"Aomori Prefecture","offset":802},{"uri":"Akita_Prefecture","surface_form":"Akita Prefecture","offset":820},{"uri":"Nambu_clan","surface_form":"Nambu clan","offset":993},{"uri":"Morioka_Domain","surface_form":"Morioka Domain","offset":1007},{"uri":"Edo_period","surface_form":"Edo period","offset":1033},{"uri":"Meiji_restoration","surface_form":"Meiji restoration","offset":1061},{"uri":"Elementary_school","surface_form":"elementary school","offset":1310},{"uri":"Middle_school","surface_form":"middle school","offset":1344},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":1477},{"uri":"Chrysanthemum","surface_form":"chrysanthemum","offset":1519},{"uri":"Dioscorea","surface_form":"Japanese yam","offset":1534},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":1551},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"resting place","offset":1708},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":1725},{"uri":"Tomb_of_Jesus","surface_form":"Tomb of Jesus","offset":1750},{"uri":"Calvary","surface_form":"Golgotha","offset":1939},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":2041},{"uri":"Mutsu_Province","surface_form":"Mutsu Province","offset":2052},{"uri":"Rice_production_in_Japan","surface_form":"rice farmer","offset":2159},{"uri":"Excarnation","surface_form":"exposed","offset":2383},{"uri":"Grave","surface_form":"grave","offset":2497},{"uri":"Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","surface_form":"Mary, the mother of Jesus","offset":2654},{"uri":"Hebrew","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":2835},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":3178},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":3200}]}
