{"id":72051,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(anatomy)","text":"In anatomy, the atlas is the top \"cervical vertebra\" (neck bones) of the spine. In anatomy, the \"atlas\" is written (C1) for short.\nIt is named for the Atlas of mythology, because it supports the head in the same way as Atlas held the world on his shoulders.\nThe \"atlas\" connects to a vertebra called the axis. Together they form the joint connecting the skull to the rest of the spine. The \"atlas\" and \"axis\" are different in shape from all the other vertebrae. They have more movement. They allow the head to nod and to rotate (turn).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":3},{"uri":"Spine","surface_form":"spine","offset":73},{"uri":"Atlas_(Mythology)","surface_form":"Atlas","offset":151},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythology","offset":160},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":195},{"uri":"Vertebra","surface_form":"vertebra","offset":284},{"uri":"Axis_(anatomy)","surface_form":"axis","offset":304},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":354}]}
