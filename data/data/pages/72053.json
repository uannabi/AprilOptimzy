Each vertebra has a hole through which the spinal cord passes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Irregular_bone","surface_form":"irregular bone","offset":52},{"uri":"Spinal_column","surface_form":"spinal column","offset":85},{"uri":"Sacrum","surface_form":"sacrum","offset":252},{"uri":"Intervertebral_disc","surface_form":"intervertebral disc","offset":288},{"uri":"Coccyx","surface_form":"coccygeal","offset":323},{"uri":"Bone","surface_form":"bone","offset":333},{"uri":"Spinal_cord","surface_form":"spinal cord","offset":610}]}
