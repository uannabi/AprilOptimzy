Another vote in February 1872 reversed the switch, and Lincoln Center became the permanent county seat. The people moved all the buildings in Abram to Lincoln, combining the two communities. In 1879, the town was incorporated as the city of Lincoln Center. It is still officially called \"Lincoln Center\" in the United States Census.
