In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and people from Marion County and McPherson County started the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a railroad was built from Florence to McPherson. In 1880 it was extended to Lyons. In 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was used by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was left in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, because of heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was left. The original railroad connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, Ellinwood. Later, the Santa Fe depot building became the Marion Library. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Santa Fe\".\nIn 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a railroad north-south from Herington through Marion to Caldwell. It closed in 1891. It was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which closed in 1980 and became the Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad.

A depot and restaurant were built too. Both Santa Fe and Rock Island had round trip fares from Chicago and western cities to Chingawasa Springs. The Panic of 1893 closed down the health spa and hotel, and businesses along the tracks never developed well. In 1893, the railroad stopped, and tracks were removed in 1910.\n20th century.\nThe National Old Trails Road, also called the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was created in 1912, and it went through Lehigh, Hillsboro, Marion and Lost Springs.\nIn 1937, the Marion County Lake was completed by the Civilian Conservation Corps south-east of Marion.

From 1964 to 1968, the Marion Reservoir was built north-west of Marion. Downstream from the Marion Reservoir, levees were built in the low areas of Marion and Florence.\n21st century.\nIn 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was built west of Marion, north to south through Marion County.
