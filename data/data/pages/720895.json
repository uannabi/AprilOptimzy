The two-storey station building, with a simple design and a kampung-style roof, was officially opened on 10 February 1996. The construction of the station affected 16 factories as land between the Yew Tee and Kranji MRT stations was bought by the government. The station was called Choa Chu Kang North. It was renamed Yew Tee in 1994.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Mass Rapid Transit","offset":45},{"uri":"North_South_MRT_Line","surface_form":"North South Line","offset":85},{"uri":"Choa_Chu_Kang","surface_form":"Choa Chu Kang","offset":105},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":120},{"uri":"Kampung","surface_form":"kampung","offset":311}]}
