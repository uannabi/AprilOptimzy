{"id":720912,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt","text":"AutoIt is a freeware programming language for Microsoft Windows. In versions 1 and 2, it was used to create automation scripts for Microsoft Windows programs. These are sometimes called macros. In version 3, the programming language was extended to allow it to do more things.\nThe scripting language in AutoIt 1 and 2 was statement-driven. It was designed to simulate a user's input to the computer. From version 3 onward, the AutoIt syntax changed. It is now similar to the BASIC programming language. AutoIt version 3 is a general-purpose programming language. It can have types of data, such as arrays.\nAn AutoIt script can be converted into a stand-alone executable. This can be run on computers that do not have the AutoIt interpreter installed. A wide range of function libraries are available. They are known as UDFs, or \"User Defined Functions\". Some are included as standard. Others are available from the website. They add extra abilities to the language. AutoIt has a special editor, an Integrated development environment or IDE. It is based on the free SciTE editor. The compiler and help text are included in this special editor and provide a standard environment for developers.\nUsage.\nAutoIt is often used to produce utility software for Microsoft Windows. These programs can automate routine tasks. Example use includes: systems management, monitoring, maintenance, and software installation. It is also used to simulate user interaction. In this use an application is \"driven\" to do things by an AutoIt script which behaves like a human user. An AutoIT script can issue keypresses, mouse clicks, type text and so on. In this way it simulates a human user of an application.\nAutoIt has been used in low-cost laboratory automation. Applications include instrument synchronisation, alarm monitoring and results gathering. Devices such as 3D-printers can also be controlled.\nHello world.\nMsgBox($MB_SYSTEMMODAL, \"Title\", \"Hello, world!\")\nAutomating the Windows Calculator.\nMsgBox($MB_OK, \"Attention\", \"Avoid touching the keyboard or mouse during automation.\", 6)\nIf WinExists(\"[CLASS:CalcFrame]\") = 0 Then Exit\nMsgBox($MB_OK, \"Leap Year\", @YEAR & \" is not a leap year.\", 5)\nMsgBox($MB_OK, \"Leap Year\", @YEAR & \" is a leap year.\", 5)\nFind average.\n_Example(); Run the example.\nFunc _Example()\nLocal $sInput = InputBox(\"Find Average\", \"Enter some numbers separated by commas: 1,2,42,100,3\")\nLocal $fAverage = _Find_Average($aSplit)\nMsgBox($MB_OK, \"Find Average\", \"Result: \" & $fAverage)\nEndFunc;==>_Example\nFunc _Find_Average($aArray)\nIf Not IsArray($aArray) Then Return SetError(1, 0, VarGetType($aArray))\nFor $i = 1 To $aArray[0]\nEndFunc;==>_Find_Average\nLicense.\nThe developers of AutoIt originally released the source code under the GNU General Public License (GPL).\nIn 2006, the license was changed for version 3.2.0 and later versions to their own closed source license.\nSome of the code from version 3.1 was used to create a fork by the AutoHotkey project. This was allowed under the GPL licence terms. The AutoHotkey community is continuing to develop and release the code under the GPL.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Freeware","surface_form":"freeware","offset":12},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":21},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":46},{"uri":"Automation","surface_form":"automation","offset":108},{"uri":"Macro_(computer_science)","surface_form":"macros","offset":186},{"uri":"Scripting_language","surface_form":"scripting language","offset":281},{"uri":"BASIC","surface_form":"BASIC","offset":475},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":541},{"uri":"Array_data_structure","surface_form":"arrays","offset":598},{"uri":"Executable","surface_form":"executable","offset":659},{"uri":"Integrated_development_environment","surface_form":"Integrated development environment","offset":998},{"uri":"SciTE","surface_form":"SciTE","offset":1065},{"uri":"Utility_software","surface_form":"utility software","offset":1232},{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":1253},{"uri":"Keyboard_(computer)","surface_form":"keypresses","offset":1587},{"uri":"Computer_mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":1599},{"uri":"3D_printing","surface_form":"3D-printer","offset":1852},{"uri":"GPL","surface_form":"GNU General Public License (GPL)","offset":2748},{"uri":"Closed_source","surface_form":"closed source","offset":2865},{"uri":"Fork_(software_development)","surface_form":"fork","offset":2943},{"uri":"AutoHotkey","surface_form":"AutoHotkey","offset":2955}]}
