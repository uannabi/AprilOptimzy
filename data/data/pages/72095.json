{"id":72095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodendron","text":"\"Philodendron\" (\"tree lover\") is a large genus of the Arum family, Araceae. Currently, about 900 different species are known. The plants are evergreen flowering plants. Some of them are vines, some can grow as epiphytes. Most of them grow like bushes. They can reach a height of about 6 meters.\nVery often, \"Philodendron\" are grown as houseplants. They grow quickly, and are easy to care for. Sometimes \"Monstera\" are still called \"Philodendron\". That plant is very similar.\n\"Philodendron\" are sometime grown because they can neutralise some poisons commonly found indoors, most notably formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and benzene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":41},{"uri":"Arum","surface_form":"Arum","offset":54},{"uri":"Araceae","surface_form":"Araceae","offset":67},{"uri":"Evergreen","surface_form":"evergreen","offset":141},{"uri":"Flowering_plants","surface_form":"flowering plants","offset":151},{"uri":"Vine","surface_form":"vine","offset":186},{"uri":"Epiphyte","surface_form":"epiphyte","offset":210},{"uri":"Houseplant","surface_form":"houseplant","offset":335},{"uri":"Monstera","surface_form":"Monstera","offset":404},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":542},{"uri":"Formaldehyde","surface_form":"formaldehyde","offset":587},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"carbon monoxide","offset":601},{"uri":"Benzene","surface_form":"benzene","offset":621}]}
