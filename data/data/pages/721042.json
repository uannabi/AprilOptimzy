{"id":721042,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educating_Rita_(movie)","text":"\"Educating Rita\" is a British 1983 drama/comedy film directed by Lewis Gilbert. The screenplay is by Willy Russell based on his 1980 stage play. The film stars Michael Caine, Julie Walters, Michael Williams and Maureen Lipman. It won multiple major awards for best actor and best actress and was nominated for three Academy Awards.\nCaine and Walters both won BAFTA and Golden Globe awards for best actor and actress. The British Film Institute ranked \"Educating Rita\" the 84th greatest British film of the 20th century.\nPlot.\nRita (Julie Walters) is a 26-year-old Liverpudlian working-class hairdresser. She is dissatisfied with the routine of her work. She is reluctant to have a child. She fears it will tie her to the same monotonous routine for life. She yearns to escape to something, without exactly knowing what that is. She signs up for an Open University course in English Literature. Her assigned tutor is Frank Bryant (Michael Caine). Bryant is a jaded university lecturer. He describes his abilities as \"appalling but good enough for his appalling students\". His passion for literature is reignited by Rita. Her ability for the subject is limited by her lack of education. Frank finds her enthusiasm refreshing. Frank's cynicism returns as he notices Rita beginning to adopt the pretensions of the university culture he despises. The film ends with Frank being sent to Australia.\nProduction.\nLewis Gilbert says it was difficult to raise finance for the film. \"Columbia wanted me to cast Dolly Parton as Rita\". Julie Walters, in her feature-film debut, reprised her role from the stage production.\nThe film was shot in Dublin. Trinity College, Dublin, is used as the setting for the university. University College Dublin, in Belfield, Dublin, is used for Rita's summer school. The room used by Bryant as his office is in the College Historical Society. The room used by Bryant as his tutorial room is in the University Philosophical Society. The production left portraits of Douglas Hyde and Isaac Butt, and a bust of John Pentland Mahaffy on display. Number 8 Hogan Avenue in Dublin near Grand Canal Dock was used for Rita's house. A house in Burlington Road, Ballsbridge was used for Bryant's. The scene set in France was filmed in Maynooth, County Kildare. Pearse Station and Dublin Airport were also used. The scene in the pub was shot in The Stag's Head pub on Dame Court in Dublin.\nCritics.\nThe American \"Variety\" magazine in December 1982 praised Walters' interpretation of Rita as \"witty, down-to-earth, kind and loaded with common sense.\"\nIan Nathan reviewing the film for Britain's \"Empire\" film magazine calls it a \"gem,\". He gave it four out of five stars.\nAmerican critic Janet Maslin called the film \"the perfect play about literature for anyone who wouldn't dream of actually reading books\".\nChicago critic Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four. He said Russell's screen adaptation \"added mistresses, colleagues, husbands, in-laws, students and a faculty committee, [that were] all unnecessary\".\nRetrospective assessments.\nIn 1999, the film was among the BFI Top 100 British films.\nIn 2007, while promoting the remake of \"Sleuth\", Caine called \"Educating Rita\" \"the last good picture [he] made before [he] mentally retired.\"\nHome media.\nThe film was released on DVD in the UK and the US. In 2008, ITV Studios released it on Blu-Ray in the UK (Region B) as a 25th Anniversary edition.\nProposed remake.\nIn November 2002, the then-82-year-old director Lewis Gilbert said he would like to remake it \"with a black cast that could include Halle Berry and Denzel Washington\". principal photography was to commence in 2003. The project was abandoned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Film","surface_form":"film","offset":48},{"uri":"Lewis_Gilbert","surface_form":"Lewis Gilbert","offset":65},{"uri":"Willy_Russell","surface_form":"Willy Russell","offset":101},{"uri":"Educating_Rita","surface_form":"his 1980 stage play","offset":124},{"uri":"Michael_Caine","surface_form":"Michael Caine","offset":160},{"uri":"Julie_Walters","surface_form":"Julie Walters","offset":175},{"uri":"Michael_Williams_(actor)","surface_form":"Michael Williams","offset":190},{"uri":"Maureen_Lipman","surface_form":"Maureen Lipman","offset":211},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":316},{"uri":"BAFTA_Awards","surface_form":"BAFTA","offset":359},{"uri":"Golden_Globe","surface_form":"Golden Globe","offset":369},{"uri":"British_Film_Institute","surface_form":"British Film Institute","offset":421},{"uri":"BFI_Top_100_British_films","surface_form":"84th greatest British film of the 20th century","offset":472},{"uri":"Julie_Walters","surface_form":"Julie Walters","offset":532},{"uri":"Liverpudlian","surface_form":"Liverpudlian","offset":564},{"uri":"Working-class","surface_form":"working-class","offset":577},{"uri":"Open_University","surface_form":"Open University","offset":848},{"uri":"English_Literature","surface_form":"English Literature","offset":874},{"uri":"Michael_Caine","surface_form":"Michael Caine","offset":930},{"uri":"Dolly_Parton","surface_form":"Dolly Parton","offset":1499},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":1630},{"uri":"Trinity_College%2C_Dublin","surface_form":"Trinity College, Dublin","offset":1638},{"uri":"University_College_Dublin","surface_form":"University College Dublin","offset":1706},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":1746},{"uri":"College_Historical_Society","surface_form":"College Historical Society","offset":1836},{"uri":"University_Philosophical_Society","surface_form":"University Philosophical Society","offset":1919},{"uri":"Douglas_Hyde","surface_form":"Douglas Hyde","offset":1986},{"uri":"Isaac_Butt","surface_form":"Isaac Butt","offset":2003},{"uri":"John_Pentland_Mahaffy","surface_form":"John Pentland Mahaffy","offset":2029},{"uri":"Grand_Canal_Dock","surface_form":"Grand Canal Dock","offset":2100},{"uri":"Ballsbridge","surface_form":"Ballsbridge","offset":2172},{"uri":"National_University_of_Ireland%2C_Maynooth","surface_form":"Maynooth","offset":2245},{"uri":"County_Kildare","surface_form":"County Kildare","offset":2255},{"uri":"Pearse_Station","surface_form":"Pearse Station","offset":2271},{"uri":"Dublin_Airport","surface_form":"Dublin Airport","offset":2290},{"uri":"Variety_(magazine)","surface_form":"Variety","offset":2422},{"uri":"Empire_(film_magazine)","surface_form":"Empire","offset":2604},{"uri":"Janet_Maslin","surface_form":"Janet Maslin","offset":2696},{"uri":"Roger_Ebert","surface_form":"Roger Ebert","offset":2833},{"uri":"Movie_adaptation","surface_form":"screen adaptation","offset":2900},{"uri":"BFI_Top_100_British_films","surface_form":"BFI Top 100 British films","offset":3091},{"uri":"Sleuth_(2007_movie)","surface_form":"Sleuth","offset":3158},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":3298},{"uri":"ITV","surface_form":"ITV","offset":3333},{"uri":"Blu-Ray","surface_form":"Blu-Ray","offset":3360},{"uri":"Lewis_Gilbert","surface_form":"Lewis Gilbert","offset":3485},{"uri":"Halle_Berry","surface_form":"Halle Berry","offset":3569},{"uri":"Denzel_Washington","surface_form":"Denzel Washington","offset":3585},{"uri":"Principal_photography","surface_form":"principal photography","offset":3605}]}
