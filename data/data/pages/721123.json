It was written by Al Hunter Ashton for the BBC.\nIt stars Gary Oldman, Phil Davis, Charles Lawson and Steve McFadden.\nThe film is based on the activities of the Inter City Firm, a football firm of West Ham United during the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe film, courted controversy on release. It has come to be regarded among the best films on the subject of football hooliganism.\nIt is notable for having almost no background music. The only music is over the opening titles. It is Dean Martin's rendition of \"That's Amore\".\nOldman's performance has been hailed as one of the greatest of his career.\nPlot.\nClive Bissel (nicknamed \"Bex\", or \"Bexy\") is a married man with a baby son. He is the leader of a hooligan firm known as the ICC (Inter City Crew). His wife disapproves of his activities as a football hooligan. These contrast to his respectable job as an estate agent. He is unwilling to give up violence as it gives him a \"buzz\".\nBexy's father accepts his son's lifestyle. He takes a group photograph of the 'tooled up' gang. He boasts that he did similar activities when younger. He feels that Bex has gone soft because they now use weapons.\nThe film begins with a rival gang called \"The Buccaneers\" vandalising Bexy's Ford Sierra XR4x4. While Bexy is playing football, they spray graffiti in the dressing room. Yeti, the leader of the Bucaneeers drives a white Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet across the football pitch.\nBexy wants to form a 'National Firm' made up from rival gangs. He wants this 'firm' to be big enough to take on the large international hooligan groups. Bexy meets leaders from other firms in the Tower Hotel in London. This includes the Buccaneers. The other gangs like the idea. They do not like the idea of Bexy being \"top boy\". The rival firms agree to fight each other to decide who will lead the new \"firm\" into Europe.\nBexy uses intimidation to keep his position as leader of the ICC. The young men think of themselves as respected figures in their local community. Bexy's wife tells him that is not correct. She says everyone thinks of him as a joke. She says they fear his violent nature, so few are willing to stand up to him.\nThe ICC survive violent clashes with the other gangs. They must still defeat the Buccaneers. Bexy is looking forward to defeating Yeti. Bexy beats up Yeti during the ICC's clash with the Buccaneers. He is shot dead by an injured Yeti.\nThe closing scene depicts the surviving ICC members in a pub. They honour Bexy as a hero. They will fight the European firms in memory of their dead leader. The hooligans agree that Bex was a visionary who brought them together. They give him legendary status. They vow to continue.\nReception and legacy.\nIt has been both celebrated and condemned for its violent content.\nTom Dawson in \"The List\" reported that it \"is widely considered to be the toughest and most insightful screen depiction of football hooligans\".\n\"Vice\" critic Harry Sword wrote that \"The Firm\" remains the definitive celluloid document on football hooliganism\".\nPhilip French in \"The Observer\" described the film as \"by some way the best movie on the subject of football hooliganism and a key text on the subject of Thatcher's Britain.\"\nFilm4 hailed \"The Firm\" as a \"brilliant and compelling drama\". It features Oldman \"at his visceral, intense best\".\nJosh Winning of \"Total Film\" observed its \"unflinching depictions of violence\". He named Oldman's \"stunning\" performance as the best of his career.\nIn 2018, Matthew Thrift of the British Film Institute wrote that Bissell \"remains probably Gary Oldman's greatest screen performance\".\n\"The Firm\" has been described as a cult classic.\nHome media releases.\nThe film was first released on VHS on 21 Oct 1996. It was in a double pack with the similarly themed ID.\nA DVD was first released by Prism Leisure on 2 Feb 2004.\nThe film has been sold as part of numerous box-sets.
