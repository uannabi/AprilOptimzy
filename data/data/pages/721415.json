{"id":721415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneware","text":"Stoneware is a broad term for pottery or other ceramics fired at a relatively high temperature. It may or may not be glazed. It was developed after earthenware and before porcelain. Stoneware can be made from a much wider range of clays than porcelain.\nHistorically, reaching high temperatures was a big challenge. Lower temperatures were used for a long time. Earthenware can be fired as low as 600\u00B0C. This was done in primitive pit firing, but to was more typical.\nAs a rough guide, modern earthenwares are normally fired in a kiln at temperatures in the range of about 1,000\u00B0C (1,830 \u00B0F) to; stonewares at between about to; and porcelains at between about to.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pottery","surface_form":"pottery","offset":30},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramic","offset":47},{"uri":"Glaze","surface_form":"glaze","offset":117},{"uri":"Earthenware","surface_form":"earthenware","offset":148},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":171},{"uri":"Clay","surface_form":"clay","offset":231},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":242},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"C","offset":400},{"uri":"Pit_fire","surface_form":"pit firing","offset":430},{"uri":"Kiln","surface_form":"kiln","offset":529},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"C","offset":578},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"\u00B0F","offset":587}]}
