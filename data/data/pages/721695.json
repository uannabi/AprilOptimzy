{"id":721695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salp","text":"A salp is a barrel-shaped, planktic tunicate.\nSalps moves by contracting. This pumps water through their gelatinous bodies. It is one of the most efficient examples of jet propulsion in the animal kingdom.\nThe salp pumps water through its internal feeding filters and feeds on phytoplankton.\nSalps are common in all seas. The most salps are in the Southern Ocean (near Antarctica), where they may form enormous swarms, often in deep water. They are sometimes even more abundant than krill.\nAlthough salps look similar to jellyfish with their simple body form and behaviour, in fact they are chordates. This means they are animals with a dorsal nerve cord. They are related to vertebrates, animals with backbones.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plankton","surface_form":"planktic","offset":27},{"uri":"Tunicate","surface_form":"tunicate","offset":36},{"uri":"Jet_propulsion","surface_form":"jet propulsion","offset":168},{"uri":"Phytoplankton","surface_form":"phytoplankton","offset":277},{"uri":"Southern_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Ocean","offset":348},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":369},{"uri":"Krill","surface_form":"krill","offset":483},{"uri":"Jellyfish","surface_form":"jellyfish","offset":521},{"uri":"Chordate","surface_form":"chordate","offset":591},{"uri":"Dorsal","surface_form":"dorsal","offset":637},{"uri":"Nerve_cord","surface_form":"nerve cord","offset":644},{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":676},{"uri":"Vertebral_column","surface_form":"backbone","offset":702}]}
