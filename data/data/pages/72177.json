{"id":72177,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_Summer_Olympics","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 1944 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XIII Olympiad, were not held.\nThe games were cancelled because of World War II. They would have been held in London, England, which won the bid in the June 1939 International Olympic Committee election, over Rome, Detroit, Lausanne, Athens, Budapest, Helsinki and Montreal.\nLondon hosted the next Olympic Games, the 1948 Summer Olympics, awarded without an election.\nIn spite of the war, the IOC had many events at its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland to celebrate its 50th anniversary. These events happened on 17 June to 19 June 1944 and were called \"The Jubilee Celebrations of IOC\" by Carl Diem, the man who began the modern tradition of the Olympic torch relay.\nPolish POWs in the Woldenberg (Dobiegniew) Oflag II-C POW camp were granted permission by their Nazi captors to have an unofficial \"POW Olympics\" in 1944, showing that the Olympic spirit can survive even during war.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":142},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":185},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":193},{"uri":"International_Olympic_Committee","surface_form":"International Olympic Committee","offset":237},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":284},{"uri":"Detroit","surface_form":"Detroit","offset":290},{"uri":"Lausanne","surface_form":"Lausanne","offset":299},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":309},{"uri":"Budapest","surface_form":"Budapest","offset":317},{"uri":"Helsinki","surface_form":"Helsinki","offset":327},{"uri":"Montreal","surface_form":"Montreal","offset":340},{"uri":"1948_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1948 Summer Olympics","offset":392},{"uri":"Lausanne","surface_form":"Lausanne","offset":511},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":521},{"uri":"Carl_Diem","surface_form":"Carl Diem","offset":670},{"uri":"Olympic_Flame","surface_form":"Olympic torch relay","offset":727},{"uri":"Woldenberg","surface_form":"Woldenberg","offset":767},{"uri":"Dobiegniew","surface_form":"Dobiegniew","offset":779},{"uri":"Oflag_II-C","surface_form":"Oflag II-C","offset":791},{"uri":"POW_camp","surface_form":"POW camp","offset":802}]}
