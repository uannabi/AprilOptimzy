{"id":7220,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula","text":"In mathematics and science, a formula is a rule or statement written in algebraic symbols. The plural of formula can be written in two ways: formulae or formulas - the choice is based on personal preference.\nFormulas use letters instead of words. A simple example of a formula is y = x. If x=1, the formula y=x would make the statement that x is the same thing as y, therefore, y=1.\nIn mathematics, a formula can also be an identity which equates two mathematical expressions together. Some key formulas under this category include the Pythagorean theorem, binomial theorem, Euler's formula and De Moivre's formula. The expression \"V\"=\"lwh\", which relates the volume \"V\" to the length \"l\", width \"w\" and height \"h\" of a rectangular box, is another example of a formula in geometry.\nIn science, one of the most well known formulas is the formula for energy, \"e\" = \"mc\"2, created by Albert Einstein. Here, \"e\" represents energy, \"m\" represents mass and \"c\" is the speed of light. Thus, energy = mass \u00D7 speed of light 2.\nThe \"formula\" e = mc2 is also an equation. Every equation is a formula, but not every formula is an equation. For instance, the formula x\u2261y (x \"is defined as\" y) is not an equation, because no \"=\" sign is used.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":19},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":43},{"uri":"Statement","surface_form":"statement","offset":51},{"uri":"Algebraic_symbols","surface_form":"algebraic symbols","offset":72},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":95},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":386},{"uri":"Identity_(mathematics)","surface_form":"identity","offset":424},{"uri":"Pythagorean_theorem","surface_form":"Pythagorean theorem","offset":536},{"uri":"Binomial_theorem","surface_form":"binomial theorem","offset":557},{"uri":"Euler%27s_formula","surface_form":"Euler's formula","offset":575},{"uri":"De_Moivre%27s_formula","surface_form":"De Moivre's formula","offset":595},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":772},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":785},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":849},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":881},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":919},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":942},{"uri":"Light","surface_form":"light","offset":971},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":1051}]}
