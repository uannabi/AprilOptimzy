{"id":72218,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine","text":"Cytosine is one of the 5 main nucleobases used in storing and transporting genetic information within a cell in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.\nIn DNA and RNA, cytosine is paired with guanine. However, it is unstable, and can change into uracil (spontaneous deamination). This can lead to a point mutation if not repaired by the DNA repair enzymes such as uracil glycosylase, which cleaves a uracil in DNA.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nucleobase","surface_form":"nucleobase","offset":30},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":75},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":104},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":116},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":130},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":138},{"uri":"Guanine","surface_form":"guanine","offset":183},{"uri":"Uracil","surface_form":"uracil","offset":237},{"uri":"Deamination","surface_form":"spontaneous deamination","offset":245},{"uri":"Point_mutation","surface_form":"point mutation","offset":290},{"uri":"DNA_repair","surface_form":"DNA repair","offset":328},{"uri":"Enzymes","surface_form":"enzymes","offset":339}]}
