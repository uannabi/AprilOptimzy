{"id":722288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_I_region","text":"=\"preserve\">An HI region or H I region (\"H one\") is a cloud in the interstellar medium composed of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI).\nThese regions do not emit detectable visible light (except in spectral lines from metal elements).\nH I regions are clouds of neutral hydrogen which glow faintly with infrared light. Because they are common in our galaxy, they obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths. An exception is the Lockman Hole, through which we have a fairly clear window to distant objects.\nAnother window into deep space is the Chandra Deep Field South. This was chosen for the Chandra X-ray Observatory satellite.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interstellar_cloud","surface_form":"cloud","offset":54},{"uri":"Interstellar_medium","surface_form":"interstellar medium","offset":67},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":114},{"uri":"Visible_light","surface_form":"visible light","offset":166},{"uri":"Spectrum","surface_form":"spectral lines","offset":191},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":211},{"uri":"Element","surface_form":"element","offset":217},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":295},{"uri":"Ultraviolet","surface_form":"ultraviolet","offset":388},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"x-ray","offset":409},{"uri":"Wavelengths","surface_form":"wavelengths","offset":415},{"uri":"Lockman_Hole","surface_form":"Lockman Hole","offset":448},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"deep space","offset":546},{"uri":"Chandra_Deep_Field_South","surface_form":"Chandra Deep Field South","offset":564},{"uri":"Chandra_X-ray_Observatory","surface_form":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","offset":614},{"uri":"Artificial_satellite","surface_form":"satellite","offset":640}]}
