{"id":722299,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_Deep_Field_South","text":"The Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) is an image taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory satellite.\nThe location has, like the Lockman Hole, a relatively clear \"window\" through the clouds of neutral hydrogen gas in our Milky Way galaxy. This allows us to clearly see the rest of the universe in X-rays.\nThe image is centered on a patch of sky in the Southern Hemisphere Fornax constellation. This region was selected because it has much less galactic gas and dust to obscure distant sources.\nMore observations was taken between 2000 and 2010. The Chandra Deep Field South is the single target where Chandra has observed the longest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chandra_X-ray_Observatory","surface_form":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","offset":62},{"uri":"Artificial_satellite","surface_form":"satellite","offset":88},{"uri":"Lockman_Hole","surface_form":"Lockman Hole","offset":126},{"uri":"H_I_region","surface_form":"neutral hydrogen gas","offset":190},{"uri":"Milky_Way","surface_form":"Milky Way","offset":218},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":294},{"uri":"Southern_Hemisphere","surface_form":"Southern Hemisphere","offset":349},{"uri":"Fornax","surface_form":"Fornax","offset":369},{"uri":"Constellation","surface_form":"constellation","offset":376}]}
