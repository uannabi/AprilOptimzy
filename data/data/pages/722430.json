{"id":722430,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole","text":"The Seminole are a group of Native American people from Florida. Today, many Seminole people live in different groups across Florida and Oklahoma.\nThe Seminole Nation began in the 18th century, when many groups of Native Americans came together in Florida. Much of Seminole culture comes from the Muscogee (Creek) people from Georgia and Alabama, who made up a large part of the Seminole Nation when it was formed. The the name \"Seminole\" comes the word for \"runaway\" in the Muscogee language, which many Seminole people spoke.\nThe Seminole developed an independent identity over a period of time in the 18th and 19th Centuries. During this time they traded with British and Spanish colonists who were living in Florida. Many free blacks and escaped slaves settled near Seminole land and paid tributes to the Seminole tribe. These people later became known as \"Black Seminoles.\"\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, many Americans tried to move into Seminole land. This created conflict leading to the Seminole Wars (1818-1858).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"Native American","offset":28},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":56},{"uri":"Oklahoma","surface_form":"Oklahoma","offset":137},{"uri":"Muscogee","surface_form":"Muscogee","offset":297},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":326},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":338},{"uri":"Colonist","surface_form":"colonists","offset":683},{"uri":"Slavery_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"slaves","offset":750},{"uri":"American_Revolutionary_War","surface_form":"American Revolutionary War","offset":889}]}
