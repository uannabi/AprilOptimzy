{"id":72251,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine","text":"e=\"preserve\">Guanine is one of the five main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.\nThe others are adenine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil. With the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine.\nBasic principles.\nGuanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA and uracil only in RNA.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nucleobase","surface_form":"nucleobase","offset":45},{"uri":"Nucleic_acid","surface_form":"nucleic acid","offset":70},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":84},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":92},{"uri":"Adenine","surface_form":"adenine","offset":112},{"uri":"Cytosine","surface_form":"cytosine","offset":121},{"uri":"Thymine","surface_form":"thymine","offset":131},{"uri":"Uracil","surface_form":"uracil","offset":144},{"uri":"Purine","surface_form":"purine","offset":205}]}
