{"id":722534,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9","text":"=\"preserve\">A prot\u00E9g\u00E9 is literally a \"protected one\". It is used of a younger person being being developed under the guidance of an experienced older person. It is a French term.\nThe younger person might be seen as an apprentice, and the older person as a mentor. If it is a physical activity, such as sport or dance, then the formal term might be 'trainer'. However, the term is \"not\" formal or official. It is just a way of describing a relationship. Psychosocial support and career guidance come into it, but usually not money.\nSo the relationship is informal, but often important for the prot\u00E9g\u00E9.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":166},{"uri":"Apprentice","surface_form":"apprentice","offset":218},{"uri":"Mentor","surface_form":"mentor","offset":256},{"uri":"Trainer","surface_form":"trainer","offset":349},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":478},{"uri":"Informal","surface_form":"informal","offset":554}]}
