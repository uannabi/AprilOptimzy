Raleigh learned about it from indigenous peoples.\nRoraima has a summit area. It is bounded on all sides by cliffs rising.\nThe mountain is in Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil. Mount Roraima is the point where the boundaries of Venezuela, Brazil and British Guiana actually meet. A stone stands on its summit, put there by the International Commission in 1931.\nMount Roraima lies on the Guiana Shield. It is the highest peak of Guyana's Highland Range. The highest point in Guyana and the highest point of the Brazilian state of Roraima lie on the plateau, but Venezuela and Brazil have higher mountains elsewhere. The triple border point is at, and the mountain's highest point is called 'Laberintos del Norte'.\nAlthough the steep sides of the plateau make it difficult, it was the first recorded major table-top to be climbed. Sir Everard im Thurn walked up a forested ramp on 18 December 1884 to scale the plateau. This route also used by the Clementis group in their climb of 15 January 1916. It is one of the most important mountain trekking routes in Venezuela.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":55},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":67},{"uri":"Walter_Raleigh","surface_form":"Sir Walter Raleigh","offset":142},{"uri":"Indigenous_people","surface_form":"indigenous people","offset":219},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":330},{"uri":"Guyana","surface_form":"Guyana","offset":341},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":352},{"uri":"Guiana_Shield","surface_form":"Guiana Shield","offset":570},{"uri":"Roraima","surface_form":"Roraima","offset":712},{"uri":"Everard_im_Thurn","surface_form":"Everard im Thurn","offset":1016},{"uri":"Cecil_Clementi","surface_form":"Clementis","offset":1129}]}
