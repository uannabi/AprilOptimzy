Different levels of competition include middle school, high school, collegiate men and, women 5km (3.1 mi) and, amateur, and professional.\nThe scoring in these events gives one point to the winner, two points to the person who finished second, and so on. In an \"invitational\" or \"meet\" where teams of runners count up the points of their top five finishers. This is their score. The team with the lowest score wins. If there is a tie, the team with the fastest sixth man wins.\nTimes in races depend on the terrain, weather, and the other runners. This means that two athletes competing in different places in the world who are running the same time might not be at the same ability level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Run","surface_form":"running","offset":28},{"uri":"Racing","surface_form":"race","offset":36},{"uri":"Terrain","surface_form":"terrain","offset":80},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competition","offset":109},{"uri":"Middle_school","surface_form":"middle school","offset":129},{"uri":"High_school","surface_form":"high school","offset":144},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"collegiate","offset":157},{"uri":"Amateur","surface_form":"amateur","offset":201},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":214},{"uri":"Score","surface_form":"scoring","offset":232},{"uri":"Event","surface_form":"event","offset":249},{"uri":"Tie","surface_form":"tie","offset":519},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":604},{"uri":"Ability","surface_form":"ability","offset":763}]}
