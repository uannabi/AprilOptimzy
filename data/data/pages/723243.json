Schuster also worked as curator of the Norton-Brown Herbarium at the University of Maryland, College Park.\nIn 2011, Schuster created the genus \"Duma\" for some species previously placed in \"Muehlenbeckia\", but which were shown by molecular phylogenetic studies to form a distinct clade. The name is derived from the Latin for \"thorn-bush.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kaindorf","surface_form":"Kaindorf","offset":59},{"uri":"University_of_Melbourne","surface_form":"University of Melbourne","offset":190},{"uri":"National_Herbarium_of_Victoria","surface_form":"National Herbarium of Victoria","offset":244},{"uri":"Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Melbourne","surface_form":"Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne","offset":276},{"uri":"University_of_Maryland%2C_College_Park","surface_form":"University of Maryland, College Park","offset":378},{"uri":"Duma_(plant)","surface_form":"Duma","offset":453},{"uri":"Muehlenbeckia","surface_form":"Muehlenbeckia","offset":498},{"uri":"Molecular_phylogenetics","surface_form":"molecular phylogenetic","offset":538},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":588}]}
