The rash is urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. This is itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful. This is an example of a defence against herbivores.\nThe vine's leaves come in threes, with a shiny appearance caused by the oil on the leaves. It is a common weed in the eastern North America and parts of China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vine","surface_form":"vine","offset":43},{"uri":"Urushiol","surface_form":"urushiol","offset":98},{"uri":"Dermatitis","surface_form":"dermatitis","offset":123},{"uri":"Defence_against_herbivores","surface_form":"defence against herbivores","offset":209},{"uri":"Weed","surface_form":"weed","offset":343},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":363},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":390}]}
