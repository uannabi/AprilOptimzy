{"id":723582,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishun_MRT_station","text":"Yishun MRT station (NS13) is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the North South Line in Yishun, Singapore.\nYishun station used to be the terminus of the line between 1988 and 1996, until the Woodlands Extension was completed and opened on 10 February 1996. Currently, certain trains would still terminate at this station for the truncated service between Yishun station and Marina South Pier MRT station which only operates during morning peak hours on weekdays. Prior to 2 October 2019, short-working trips exist from Yishun to Marina South Pier in early evening periods and late night periods.\nYishun station is currently one of the two MRT stations that serve Yishun New Town; the other being Khatib MRT station. Together with Yishun Bus Interchange and Northpoint City, it also forms as an integrated transport hub - Yishun Integrated Transport Hub.\nHistory.\nIn December 2001, the Singapore embassies attack plot was discovered, and had included plans to bomb this station at several points, including the sewers near the station. This was brought up in a debate during a session of the parliament, during which new security measures were proposed, especially on the MRT system itself.\nOn 16 April 2003, power supply to trackside equipment between Yio Chu Kang and Sembawang stations was disrupted at 8.02 am due to a lightning strike which affected eight point machines along the track.\nOn the early morning of 5 December 2006, a foreign worker in his early twenties, was hit by a train that was travelling towards Marina Bay. Train service was disrupted for more than an hour. He was later declared dead.\nOn 19 January 2008 at about 1530 hours, a call was made from a public telephone at the MRT station stating that there was a bomb at the station. Police arrested a 31-year old Chinese man that was believed to be linked to the crime on 23 February 2008. He was later charged for transmitting a false message that makes reference to a bomb.\nAt 11.45 am on 11 October 2008, a man was found on the tracks of the station and was sent to hospital. Train service was disrupted in between Sembawang and Yio Chu Kang stations, affecting 2900 people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"Mass Rapid Transit","offset":45},{"uri":"North_South_MRT_Line","surface_form":"North South Line","offset":85},{"uri":"Yishun","surface_form":"Yishun","offset":105},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":113},{"uri":"Marina_South_Pier_MRT_station","surface_form":"Marina South Pier MRT station","offset":391},{"uri":"Khatib_MRT_station","surface_form":"Khatib MRT station","offset":713},{"uri":"Singapore_embassies_attack_plot","surface_form":"Singapore embassies attack plot","offset":902},{"uri":"Sewer","surface_form":"sewer","offset":1027},{"uri":"Debate","surface_form":"debate","offset":1077},{"uri":"Parliament_of_Singapore","surface_form":"parliament","offset":1108},{"uri":"Security_on_the_Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)","surface_form":"security measures","offset":1137},{"uri":"Lightning","surface_form":"lightning","offset":1339},{"uri":"Marine_Bay_MRT_station","surface_form":"Marina Bay","offset":1537}]}
