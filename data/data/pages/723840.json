{"id":723840,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguio","text":"Baguio City is a city in northern Luzon, Philippines. Its official name is the City of Baguio. People know it as the Summer Capital of the Philippines because its climate is cooler than other parts of the country. It is cooler because it is more than 4,800 feet above sea level. People call it the \"City of Pines\" because it is in a region where pine trees and orchids can grow.\nThe United States founded Baguio in 1900. This was so it could use have a hill station. Baguio City was the United States' only hill station in Asia.\nBaguio is physically within Benguet province but is a separate political unit. Baguio was Benguet's capital from 1901 to 1916. But Baguio became a chartered city in 1916. This meant that Baguio had a status that is similar to a province.\nBaguio belongs to the Cordillera Administrative Region. That region also has the provinces of Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain Province. The city is the region's business and educational centre.\nThe 2015 census says that Baguio has 345,366 people living there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":17},{"uri":"Luzon","surface_form":"Luzon","offset":34},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":41}]}
