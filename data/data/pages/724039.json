While the Olympians chose Mount Olympus the Titans picked Mount Othrys. The two mountains were in actuality ten miles apart.\nThe Black Castle.\nAfter Kronos freed the Cyclops and the Hekatonkheires, Kronos ordered them to build a castle made out of the metal found in Mount Othrys. The castle then became the base of the Titans during the war between the Olympians and the Titans\nFun Facts.\nThe mountain was so tremendous, even Zeus was afraid when he first saw it.\nThe Titans were evil and cruel, which made Olympian Gods the exact same, since they are parents of Gods. The Olympian Gods are actually Titans and the heroes are demi-titans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":57},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":77},{"uri":"Phthiotis","surface_form":"Phthiotis","offset":113},{"uri":"Magnesia_(regional_unit)","surface_form":"Magnesia","offset":144},{"uri":"Titan_(mythology)","surface_form":"Titans","offset":190},{"uri":"Twelve_Olympians","surface_form":"Olympians","offset":205},{"uri":"Olympus","surface_form":"Mount Olympus","offset":350},{"uri":"Kronos","surface_form":"Kronos","offset":473},{"uri":"Cyclops","surface_form":"Cyclops","offset":490},{"uri":"Hekatonkheires","surface_form":"Hekatonkheires","offset":506},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":751}]}
