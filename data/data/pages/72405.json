{"id":72405,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilwood","text":"Brazilwood or Pau-Brasil, sometimes known as Pernambuco wood (\"Caesalpina echinata\") is a Brazilian tree. It has a dense, orange-red wood (which takes a high shine), and it is the most frequently used wood for making bows for string instruments from the violin family. The wood also gives a red dye called brazilin.\nThere are several trees in this family which have very similar properties, including the development of red dye. The term \"brazilwood\" is sometimes used for these other species as well. The tree was exploited for their dye in the 18th century, and is now lost over much of its original range.\nWhen Pedro \u00C1lvares Cabral explored Brazil, he named it after the brazilwood that he found there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":90},{"uri":"Bow_(music)","surface_form":"bows","offset":217},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":254},{"uri":"Dye","surface_form":"dye","offset":295},{"uri":"Brazilin","surface_form":"brazilin","offset":306},{"uri":"Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral","surface_form":"Pedro \u00C1lvares Cabral","offset":614},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":644}]}
