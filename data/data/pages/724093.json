{"id":724093,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eklutna_Lake","text":"Eklutna Lake is a large, glacier-fed lake to the north of the city of Anchorage, Alaska. The lake is the city's main source of water and also helps create electric power for the city.\nPark.\nThe lake is also part of the city's large park system. It is inside Chugach state park, one of the largest state parks in the United States. People who visit may walk the long trails or camp out between the tall mountains that surround the lake. In the winter, skiing and ice skating are popular activities.\nDrive.\nThe road from the Glenn Highway out of Anchorage to the lake is ten miles long. It also climbs high into the hills as it nears the campground. Many who enjoy the drive say that it is one of the most scenic drives in Alaska.\nDam.\nTwo dams have been used to make electricity. The first was built in 1929 and worked for more than 30 years. It stopped being used in 1955 and was torn down in 2017. The new dam was built in 1951 and moves water through a tunnel to a generator used to make electricity for the city. This dam still serves the city.\nWater.\nThe lake and the river leading from it all come from melted snow high in the mountains. The city takes the water from the lake near the dam and treats it to remove germs and sand. It gives the city nearly 90% of its water. At least one company bottles water directly from Eklutna Lake to sell in stores around the country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Anchorage%2C_Alaska","surface_form":"Anchorage, Alaska","offset":70},{"uri":"Chugach_state_park","surface_form":"Chugach state park","offset":258},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":316},{"uri":"Glenn_Highway","surface_form":"Glenn Highway","offset":523},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":766},{"uri":"Electrical_generator","surface_form":"generator","offset":967},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"melted snow","offset":1108}]}
