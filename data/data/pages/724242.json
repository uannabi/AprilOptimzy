{"id":724242,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zagreb","text":"The University of Zagreb (,;) is the largest Croatian university and the oldest continuously operating university in the area covering Central Europe south of Vienna and all of Southeastern Europe.\nThe history of the University began on September 23, 1669, when the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I issued a decree granting the establishment of the \"Jesuit Academy of the Royal Free City of Zagreb\". The decree was accepted at the Council of the Croatian Kingdom on November 3, 1671. The Academy was run by the Jesuits for more than a century until the order was dissolved by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. In 1776, Empress Maria Theresa issued a decree founding the \"Royal Academy of Science\" which succeeded the previous Jesuit Academy. Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer proposed the founding of a University to the Croatian Parliament in 1861. Emperor Franz Joseph signed the decree on the establishment of the University of Zagreb in 1869. The Act of Founding was passed by the Parliament in 1874, and was ratified by the Emperor on January 5, 1874. On October 19, 1874, the \"Royal University of Franz Joseph I\" was officially opened.\nThe University is composed of 29 faculties, 3 art academies and 1 university center with more than 70,000 students. The University is as of 2018 at the 463rd place out of 1000 on the list of Universities of the world made by the Center for University World Rankings.\nFaculties.\nNatural sciences\nBiomedical sciences\nSocial sciences\nThe arts","categories":[],"infobox_types":["university"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":45},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":54},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":159},{"uri":"Southeastern_Europe","surface_form":"Southeastern Europe","offset":177},{"uri":"Leopold_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Leopold I","offset":285},{"uri":"Jesuits","surface_form":"Jesuits","offset":507},{"uri":"Pope_Clement_XIV","surface_form":"Pope Clement XIV","offset":572},{"uri":"Maria_Theresa","surface_form":"Maria Theresa","offset":615},{"uri":"Josip_Juraj_Strossmayer","surface_form":"Josip Juraj Strossmayer","offset":737},{"uri":"Croatian_Parliament","surface_form":"Croatian Parliament","offset":806},{"uri":"Franz_Joseph","surface_form":"Franz Joseph","offset":843},{"uri":"Natural_science","surface_form":"Natural science","offset":1405},{"uri":"Biomedical_sciences","surface_form":"Biomedical sciences","offset":1422},{"uri":"Social_science","surface_form":"Social science","offset":1442},{"uri":"The_arts","surface_form":"The arts","offset":1458}]}
