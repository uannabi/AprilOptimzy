{"id":72434,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav","text":"e=\"preserve\">Chav (male) and chavette (female) are mainly negative slang words in the United Kingdom for a subcultural stereotype of young underclass white people. Chav: \"a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothing\".\nThey may wear fashion based on American hip-hop such as fake gold jewellery and designer clothing, combined with elements of working class British street fashion. Many are either school age or late teens/early twenties and may come from a family culture of social security claimants (\"SS claimants\"). The term first appeared in dictionaries in 2005. They tend to listen to R&B, hip hop, UK garage, grime and reggae and drum & bass music.\n\"Chav\" has started to mean a variety of things. Most chavs do not wear Burberry \u2013 this happened mostly in the '90s and early '00s. Chavs are stereotypically narrow-minded and more often than not, below average intelligence. Chavs also tend to use slang language to appear \"cooler\" and more \"edgy\".\nChavs may be associated with criminality, including: assault, mugging, robbery, burglary and car crime. Anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were introduced to tackle such persistent offending.\nPop culture.\nIn 2011, Owen Jones published his first book, \"Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class\". Jones says in it that 'chav' is a word used to make working-class people seem less human.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":67},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":86},{"uri":"Subculture","surface_form":"subcultural","offset":107},{"uri":"Stereotype","surface_form":"stereotype","offset":119},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"underclass","offset":139},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white","offset":150},{"uri":"Fashion","surface_form":"fashion","offset":254},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":271},{"uri":"Hip-hop","surface_form":"hip-hop","offset":280},{"uri":"Jewellery","surface_form":"jewellery","offset":306},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":365},{"uri":"Social_security","surface_form":"social security","offset":497},{"uri":"Contemporary_R%26amp%3BB","surface_form":"R&B","offset":613},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":618},{"uri":"UK_garage","surface_form":"UK garage","offset":627},{"uri":"Grime_music","surface_form":"grime","offset":638},{"uri":"Reggae","surface_form":"reggae","offset":648},{"uri":"Drum_%26amp%3B_bass","surface_form":"drum & bass","offset":659},{"uri":"Burberry","surface_form":"Burberry","offset":749},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":925},{"uri":"Assault","surface_form":"assault","offset":1029},{"uri":"Mugging","surface_form":"mugging","offset":1038},{"uri":"Robbery","surface_form":"robbery","offset":1047},{"uri":"Burglary","surface_form":"burglary","offset":1056},{"uri":"Car_crime","surface_form":"car crime","offset":1069},{"uri":"Anti-social_behaviour_order","surface_form":"Anti-social behaviour order","offset":1080},{"uri":"Owen_Jones_(writer)","surface_form":"Owen Jones","offset":1192}]}
