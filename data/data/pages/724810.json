{"id":724810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_observatory","text":"e=\"preserve\">In the UK, a public health observatory (PHO) is a public health and\nwellness project. On 1 April 2013, the regional Public Health Observatories (PHOs) transferred along with the specialist observatories and the National Cancer Intelligence Network into Public Health England (PHE).\nPHO uses the word observatory, from astronomy, to show objectivity in measuring well-being.\nPublic health, environmental health, diet, recreation, outdoor education, exercise and other concerns are explored by most public health observatories.\nThe London Health Observatory pioneered methods in measuring social capital and how this affects healing and health in general.\nThere was a network of public health observatories, one in each of the nine regions in England. There are health observatories in [http://www.publichealthwalesobservatory.wales.nhs.uk/ Wales], [http://www.scotpho.org.uk/ Scotland] and [https://archive.is/20130415005426/http://www.inispho.org/ Ireland].\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20100523124802/http://www.apho.org.uk/ Association of Public Health Observatories] (APHO) represented the network of public health observatories across the UK and Ireland. It became part of Public Health England, along with all the English observatories except Lincolnshire on 1 April 2013. The Lincolnshire observatory continues with the support of the County Council.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":20},{"uri":"Public_health","surface_form":"public health","offset":63},{"uri":"Wellness_(alternative_medicine)","surface_form":"wellness","offset":81},{"uri":"Public_Health_England","surface_form":"Public Health England","offset":266},{"uri":"Observatory","surface_form":"observatory","offset":313},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":331},{"uri":"Measuring_well-being","surface_form":"measuring well-being","offset":365},{"uri":"Public_health","surface_form":"Public health","offset":387},{"uri":"Environmental_health","surface_form":"environmental health","offset":402},{"uri":"Diet_(nutrition)","surface_form":"diet","offset":424},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":430},{"uri":"Outdoor_education","surface_form":"outdoor education","offset":442},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercise","offset":461},{"uri":"Social_capital","surface_form":"social capital","offset":600},{"uri":"Healing","surface_form":"healing","offset":636},{"uri":"Health","surface_form":"health","offset":648}]}
