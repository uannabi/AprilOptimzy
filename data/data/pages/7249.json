A cancelled sequel, \"Super Mario 64 2\" for the Nintendo 64DD (N64 Disk Drive) was planned, but it was cancelled, because of the commercial failure of the Disk Drive. Luigi was planned to appear in it too. It was first shown at E3 in 2004 and released for the Nintendo DS in Japan and in the United States in 2004, and in the PAL region in early 2005. The game received positive reviews and was the fifth best-selling video game on the weekly sales chart of the week of December 2004. It has rec room mini-games which are attained by catching rabbits and a multiplayer wireless VS. Mode, where 4 players can play to get the most stars and coins in 30 seconds, taken from 4 levels and there's three different colored Yoshis (red, blue, and yellow) the one with the card is Green Yoshi and other characters can get wings to fly. In the main game, only Mario can get wings.\nStory.\nThe game begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. Mario travels to her castle, and is followed by his younger, twin brother Luigi and Mario's greedy counterpart rival Wario. Luigi accidentally starts a fight and after entering the castle, the three disappear, and Lakitu, the game's camera operator, finds Yoshi to inform him of the disappearance.\nYoshi eats a rabbit and unlocks a door to the castle and explores the castle and its courses to find his friends. Scattered throughout the castle are paintings and secret walls, which act as portals to other worlds where Bowser's minions guard Power Stars. By recovering the stars and defeating bosses, Yoshi acquires keys to other areas of the castle and rooms holding his friends captive. He first defeats Goomboss to free Mario who assists him as the two continue searching the castle and collecting Power Stars. Mario then defeats King Boo to free Luigi who then uses his invisibility power to get to Wario's key by defeating Chief Chilly. During the course of the adventure, they tackle three obstacle courses leading to a battle with Bowser.\nDefeating him the first two times earns them a key that opens other levels of the castle. After collecting 80 stars and solving the mystery of the endless stairs, Mario accesses the top room of the castle to defeat Bowser. Once he is defeated, Peach is freed and appears in front of the castle. To thank the four protagonists, she kisses Mario and bakes them the cake that she had originally promised. The game finishes with Mario, Luigi, Wario, Yoshi, and Peach standing at the front of the castle waving goodbye to the player as Lakitu films and then flies away.\nCharacters.\nEach of the characters have special abilities and their own strength and weaknesses.\nWaluigi.\nJust like how they were many rumors of Luigi and Wario (who are now playable in this game) being playable in the original game, but did not appear, there were rumors of Waluigi being in this game, but he did not appear in either game. Yoshi makes an unplayable cameo appearance on the roof after the original game is finished giving Mario 100 lives and a sparkling triple jump.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Platform_game","surface_form":"platform game","offset":30},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":47},{"uri":"Super_Mario_64","surface_form":"Super Mario 64","offset":104},{"uri":"Nintendo_64","surface_form":"Nintendo 64","offset":128},{"uri":"Nintendo_64DD","surface_form":"Nintendo 64DD","offset":188},{"uri":"Luigi","surface_form":"Luigi","offset":307},{"uri":"E3","surface_form":"E3","offset":368},{"uri":"Nintendo_DS","surface_form":"Nintendo DS","offset":400},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":415},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":432},{"uri":"Mario","surface_form":"Mario","offset":1077},{"uri":"Luigi","surface_form":"Luigi","offset":1213},{"uri":"Wario","surface_form":"Wario","offset":1256},{"uri":"Yoshi","surface_form":"Yoshi","offset":1395},{"uri":"Bowser_(Nintendo)","surface_form":"Bowser","offset":1658}]}
