{"id":724969,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdish","text":"Urdish (or Urglish), a portmanteau of Urdu and English, is the macaronic hybrid use of English and Urdu in Pakistan, involving code-switching between these languages where they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences. The term \"Urdlish\" is first recorded in 1989. Other less common colloquial portmanteau words for Urdish include (chronologically): \"Urglish\" (recorded from 1995), \"Urdlish\" (1997) and \"Urduish\" (1998).\nMany bilingual or multi-lingual Urdu speakers, being familiar with both Urdu and English, display code-switching in certain localities and between certain social groups.\nOn 14 August 2015, the Government of Pakistan launched the \"Ilm\" Pakistan movement, with a uniform curriculum in Urdish. Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister of Pakistan, said, \"Now the government is working on a new curriculum to provide a new medium to the students which will be the combination of both Urdu and English and will name it Urdish.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portmanteau","surface_form":"portmanteau","offset":23},{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":38},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":47},{"uri":"Macaronic_language","surface_form":"macaronic","offset":63},{"uri":"Urdu","surface_form":"Urdu","offset":99},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":107},{"uri":"Code-switching","surface_form":"code-switching","offset":127},{"uri":"Colloquial","surface_form":"colloquial","offset":305},{"uri":"Portmanteau_word","surface_form":"portmanteau word","offset":316},{"uri":"Code-switching","surface_form":"code-switching","offset":541},{"uri":"Government_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Government of Pakistan","offset":636},{"uri":"Ahsan_Iqbal","surface_form":"Ahsan Iqbal","offset":734}]}
