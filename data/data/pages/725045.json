Soar was publicly launched in August 2019.\nSatellite Imagery.\nSoar allows users to select an area of interest (AOI) where they can view and download near real-time ESA Sentinel-2 and NASA Landsat-8 satellite imagery. Smartphone users accessing Soar online are additionally able to view imagery from NASA MODIS and JMA Himawari-8.\nIn October 2019 Soar announced a partnership with China\u2019s state-owned satellite imaging company, China Siwei Surveying and Mapping Technology Co. Ltd \u2013 thereby enabling their enterprise customers to order imagery from SuperView-1 at 50cm per pixel resolution with fast turn-around times.\nDrone Imagery.\nDrone pilots have the functionality to upload and monetize their mapping content, providing both the pilot with a fixed commission whilst at the same time seeding Soar's 'super-map' with additional data.\nSoar stores drone imagery metadata\u2014including location, altitude, time, and equipment used\u2014on a public blockchain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Maps","surface_form":"maps","offset":24},{"uri":"Satellite_(artificial)","surface_form":"satellite","offset":142},{"uri":"Aerial","surface_form":"aerial","offset":153},{"uri":"Smartphone","surface_form":"Smartphone","offset":527},{"uri":"Blockchain","surface_form":"blockchain","offset":1249}]}
