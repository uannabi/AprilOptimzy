Flash memory, often used in secondary storage, is also non-volatile.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_memory","surface_form":"computer memory","offset":51},{"uri":"Random-access_memory","surface_form":"volatile memory","offset":143},{"uri":"ROM","surface_form":"ROM","offset":248},{"uri":"Booting","surface_form":"bootloader","offset":294},{"uri":"Flash_memory","surface_form":"Flash memory","offset":314}]}
