She and her mother Lois later accepted Christianity.\nShe is only mentioned in 2 Timothy 1:5, in which the author writes to Timothy, \"I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.\" (ESV) Many people who have commented on Eunice have also connected Eunice to 2 Tim. 3:15, where Timothy is reminded \"how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings\". For example, (ESV) Albert Barnes says \"The mother of Timothy was a pious Hebrewess, and regarded it as one of the duties of her religion to train her son in the careful knowledge of the word of God.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":4},{"uri":"Saint_Timothy","surface_form":"Timothy","offset":48},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jew","offset":75},{"uri":"Lois_(Bible)","surface_form":"Lois","offset":99},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":119},{"uri":"2_Timothy","surface_form":"2 Timothy","offset":158},{"uri":"ESV","surface_form":"ESV","offset":368},{"uri":"ESV","surface_form":"ESV","offset":569},{"uri":"Albert_Barnes_(theologian)","surface_form":"Albert Barnes","offset":574}]}
