{"id":725868,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code","text":"Rosetta Code is a wiki-based website that features ways to solve various programming problems in many different programming languages.\nWebsite.\nRosetta Code was created in 2007 by Michael Mol. The site's content is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.2, though some components may have two licenses under less strict terms.\nRosetta Code's collection of code examples shows how the functionality the user desires is achieved differently in various ways, and how \"the same\" task can be done in different programming languages.\nData and structure.\nThe Rosetta Code site is organized as a browsable cross-section of programming problems and programming languages. A programming problem's page displays solutions contributed by visitors in various programming languages, allowing someone who views the solution to compare the solution to the programming problem.\nEach programming language has its own page, which contains a list of programming problems that have solutions in that programming language. For example, a task that has a solution in the C programming language will appear in the listing for the C programming language, and if the same task has a solution in the Ruby programming language, the task will also appear in the listing for the Ruby programming language.\nLanguages.\nA list of all programming languages that have solutions to programming problems on Rosetta Code is available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["website"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"programming","offset":73},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":112},{"uri":"GNU_Free_Documentation_License","surface_form":"GNU Free Documentation License","offset":234},{"uri":"C_(programming_language)","surface_form":"C","offset":1061},{"uri":"Ruby_(programming_language)","surface_form":"Ruby","offset":1186}]}
