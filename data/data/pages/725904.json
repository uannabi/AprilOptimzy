It comes within 0.002 astronomical units of the earth every 6 years.\nSome believe that if Bennu enters a specific hole between the earth and the moon its orbit could change in a way that would make it likely to hit Earth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"C-type_asteroid","surface_form":"carbonaceous asteroid","offset":44},{"uri":"Apollo_asteroid","surface_form":"Apollo","offset":73},{"uri":"Lincoln_Near-Earth_Asteroid_Research","surface_form":"LINEAR","offset":104},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":261},{"uri":"Mythological","surface_form":"mythological","offset":270},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":357},{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"asteroid belt","offset":652},{"uri":"Gravitational_pull","surface_form":"gravitational pull","offset":675},{"uri":"Saturn","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":697},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":759},{"uri":"Astronomical_unit","surface_form":"astronomical unit","offset":802}]}
