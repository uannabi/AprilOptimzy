{"id":726012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techmoan","text":"Matthew Julius \"Mat\" Taylor (born January 1971), better known by his stage name Techmoan, is a YouTuber and blogger who has been active since May 2009, featuring consumer tech reviews and \"RetroTech\" documentaries. He lives in Wigan, Greater Manchester.\nAs well as reviews and tests, his videos often include taking products apart and, with older technology, looking at the product's history, and also what publications thought at the time, which, for audio and entertainment devices, is often Billboard magazine, which covered both consumer and trade electronics devices through articles and advertisements at the time. The Daily Telegraph and Gizmodo has quoted his statements. MarketWatch listed the YouTube Channel 6th in its \"binge-watching\" top ten using ratings on Reddit.\nCurrent product reviews on other tech items, mostly consumer products, such as action and dashcams, sometimes sponsored or donated, taking part in the affiliate marketing associates program of Amazon Services LLC, and donations to him using Patreon keep the channel alive.\nOutro skits that play at the end of his videos often feature a trio of muppet-like puppets, and frequently depict comments from viewers of his videos that lack sense or show expressive concern about minor details.\nWebsites such as AVclub, Gizmodo, Hackaday, El Espa\u00F1ol and Popular Mechanics reference his videos.\nHistory.\nIn 2006, Taylor started a YouTube channel called \"Vectrexuk\", with videos of similar items of technology, such as installing a home cinema and controlled toasters, to prove people will watch anything on YouTube.\nThe channel \"Techmoan\" was started on May 31, 2009. The first video uploaded on Techmoan was a tour of a 2009 Piaggio MP3, which was filmed at 480p and had a very basic sound quality. In 2015, he started another channel, called \"Youtube Pedant\", to host videos not about technology. In 2016, in a video covering the DVHS format, he uncovered 1080p video footage of New York City from 1993. This footage was uploaded separately to his \"Youtube Pedant\" channel where, as of December 2019, it has gotten 3.8 million views, and it has also been widely shared on websites such as Reddit and The Verge. As of June 2019, the main channel has over 870,000 subscribers and over 180 million views. Some videos on the main channel have had over 3 million views.\nLater documentary videos.\nTechmoan has made documentary videos that are about forgotten magnetic tape recording formats, such as the OMNI Entertainment System, which uses 8-track tape storage, and the HiPac, a successor of the PlayTape and related uses of it. Other videos show some of the smallest and largest analog recording tape cartridges ever made, such as the Picocassette for dictation machines or the Cantata 700 background music system. Further videos show other discontinued \u00BC-inch-tape cartridge formats, such as the Sabamobil, which uses existing 3-inch open reels in a portable format, and the portable Sanyo Micro Pack 35, as well as RCA tape cartridge and the Sony Elcaset with another compromise of playtime and sound quality, oddities and gimmicks on Compact Cassettes as \"reinventing the reel\", several ways of autoreverse, automatic multiple cassette players, endless loop cassettes, and cassette mass production technology.\nOther documentary videos Techmoan has made are about formats of vinyl recording, such as the Tefifon endless cartridge, the Seeburg 1000 background music system, vertical turntables, and other audio encodings CX and dbx, which are systems that were designed to reduce noise on vinyl records.\nFurther documentaries show other items, such as the mechanical Curta calculator, devices with Nixie tube displays, wire recording, and the WikiReader.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["YouTube personality"],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_YouTubers","surface_form":"YouTuber","offset":95},{"uri":"Blog","surface_form":"blogger","offset":108},{"uri":"Consumer_Electronics","surface_form":"consumer tech","offset":162},{"uri":"Wigan","surface_form":"Wigan","offset":227},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Greater Manchester","offset":234},{"uri":"Billboard_(magazine)","surface_form":"Billboard magazine","offset":494},{"uri":"The_Daily_Telegraph","surface_form":"The Daily Telegraph","offset":621},{"uri":"Gizmodo","surface_form":"Gizmodo","offset":645},{"uri":"MarketWatch","surface_form":"MarketWatch","offset":680},{"uri":"YouTube_Channel","surface_form":"YouTube Channel","offset":703},{"uri":"Binge-watching","surface_form":"binge-watching","offset":731},{"uri":"Rating_site","surface_form":"ratings","offset":761},{"uri":"Reddit","surface_form":"Reddit","offset":772},{"uri":"Dashcams","surface_form":"dashcams","offset":870},{"uri":"Affiliate_marketing","surface_form":"affiliate marketing","offset":931},{"uri":"Amazon_Services","surface_form":"Amazon Services","offset":973},{"uri":"Patreon","surface_form":"Patreon","offset":1021},{"uri":"Closing_credits","surface_form":"Outro","offset":1053},{"uri":"Muppet","surface_form":"muppet","offset":1124},{"uri":"Gizmodo","surface_form":"Gizmodo","offset":1292},{"uri":"Hackaday","surface_form":"Hackaday","offset":1301},{"uri":"Popular_Mechanics","surface_form":"Popular Mechanics","offset":1326},{"uri":"Piaggio_MP3","surface_form":"Piaggio MP3","offset":1697},{"uri":"480p","surface_form":"480p","offset":1730},{"uri":"D-VHS","surface_form":"DVHS","offset":1903},{"uri":"1080p","surface_form":"1080p","offset":1929},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1952},{"uri":"Reddit","surface_form":"Reddit","offset":2162},{"uri":"The_Verge","surface_form":"The Verge","offset":2173},{"uri":"Magnetic_tape","surface_form":"magnetic tape","offset":2426},{"uri":"OMNI_Entertainment_System","surface_form":"OMNI Entertainment System","offset":2471},{"uri":"8-track_tape","surface_form":"8-track tape","offset":2509},{"uri":"HiPac","surface_form":"HiPac","offset":2539},{"uri":"PlayTape","surface_form":"PlayTape","offset":2565},{"uri":"Picocassette","surface_form":"Picocassette","offset":2705},{"uri":"Cantata_700","surface_form":"Cantata 700","offset":2748},{"uri":"Sabamobil","surface_form":"Sabamobil","offset":2867},{"uri":"Sanyo_Micro_Pack_35","surface_form":"Sanyo Micro Pack 35","offset":2955},{"uri":"RCA_tape_cartridge","surface_form":"RCA tape cartridge","offset":2987},{"uri":"Elcaset","surface_form":"Elcaset","offset":3019},{"uri":"Compact_Cassette","surface_form":"Compact Cassette","offset":3107},{"uri":"Autoreverse","surface_form":"autoreverse","offset":3168},{"uri":"Endless_tape_cartridge","surface_form":"endless loop cassettes","offset":3218},{"uri":"Phonograph_record","surface_form":"vinyl recording","offset":3347},{"uri":"Tefifon","surface_form":"Tefifon","offset":3376},{"uri":"Seeburg_1000","surface_form":"Seeburg 1000","offset":3407},{"uri":"Dbx_(noise_reduction)","surface_form":"dbx","offset":3499},{"uri":"Curta_calculator","surface_form":"Curta calculator","offset":3638},{"uri":"Nixie_tube","surface_form":"Nixie tube","offset":3669},{"uri":"Wire_recording","surface_form":"wire recording","offset":3690},{"uri":"WikiReader","surface_form":"WikiReader","offset":3714}]}
