He is the son of Arne Tillberg and Ettie Tillberg.\nCareer.\nDan Tillberg started his career in 1973 as a singer, guitarist and percussionist in the progg-influenced duo \u00C4nglabarn, along with Sven Ingmar Olsson. In 1977, he started his own recording studio in Malm\u00F6, Bellatrix, and a record label of the same name in 1978.\nIn 1979, his first LP, Gatstenar, came out, which had Swedish-language cover versions of Rolling Stones songs on it. In 1981, this was followed by the LP \"Mors och fars k\u00E4rlek\", which made him successful. The next year, his next LP, K\u00E4rlek minus noll, came out, which featured Swedish-language cover versions of Bob Dylan songs. In 1983, his next LP, \"Genom t\u00E5rar\", was released, followed by \"Erogena zoner\" in 1985, which might have become his biggest success.\nIn Melodifestivalen 1985, he came in second place with \"Ta min hand\", and also took part in Melodifestivalen 1986 with \" \"ABCD\". In 1987, his LP \"Raka v\u00E4gen till paradiset\" was released, which was his last LP released before a long break. In 1986, Tillberg starred in an episode of the TV series \"Sk\u00E5nska mord\", with Ernst-Hugo J\u00E4reg\u00E5rd in the lead role.\nAfter that, he became less popular, and he went on to run an advertising company, which became bankrupt in 2001. Then he began to devote himself to music again and released some CD singles. These were followed in 2005 by Akten tar gestalt, an album that came out on two CDs and has a collection of his old songs on it, released on Mixed Media Records, a record label he started with Rickard Mattsson, also in 2005. The record label, which borrowed its name from the band Mixed Media, which was previously signed to Tillberg's former record label, Bellatrix, is now bankrupt, and the record label business with the associated recording studio has ended. While Tillberg worked as a producer, he was active in the kitchen industry through the companies K\u00F6ket i f\u00F6rsta rummet AB and Sk\u00E5nek\u00F6k & M\u00E5leri AB.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["musical artist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ystad","surface_form":"Ystad","offset":40},{"uri":"Progg","surface_form":"progg","offset":228},{"uri":"Malm%C3%B6","surface_form":"Malm\u00F6","offset":339},{"uri":"Bellatrix_(record_label)","surface_form":"Bellatrix","offset":346},{"uri":"Rolling_Stones","surface_form":"Rolling Stones","offset":491},{"uri":"Bob_Dylan","surface_form":"Bob Dylan","offset":714},{"uri":"Melodifestivalen_1985","surface_form":"Melodifestivalen 1985","offset":867},{"uri":"Melodifestivalen_1986","surface_form":"Melodifestivalen 1986","offset":956},{"uri":"ABCD_(song)","surface_form":"ABCD","offset":986},{"uri":"Ernst-Hugo_J%C3%A4reg%C3%A5rd","surface_form":"Ernst-Hugo J\u00E4reg\u00E5rd","offset":1181},{"uri":"Mixed_Media_(band)","surface_form":"Mixed Media","offset":1690}]}
