{"id":726065,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Doudna","text":"Jennifer Anne Doudna (born February 19, 1964) is an American biochemist. She known for her work in CRISPR gene editing, for which she won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Emmanuelle Charpentier.\nEarly life.\nJennifer Doudna was born in 1963. In 1985 she earned her bachelor of arts in biochemistry at Pomona College in California. She earned her PHD at Harvard University four years later. In 1994, Doudna worked at Yale University with a group of scientists studying RNA, a necessary part of genetics.\nCareer.\nDoudna is known for co-inventing the CRISPR-Cas9 which launched in 2018. CRISPR-Cas9 genetically modified DNA and only attempts to cure blood illnesses. She has won multiple medals for her invention and work such as the Kavi Prize, The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, The Gruber Genetics Prize, and the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize. But those medals and awards come with backlash and controversy. Some people believe gene editing isn\u2019t going with ethics, and when used wrong the results can be potentially harmful. Still Doudna continues to pursue her dreams.\nDoudna currently works as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Doudna teaches chemistry and molecular cell biology. She is also an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She lives in California with her husband Jamie Kate and her son Andrew. Doudna says that it is amazing that she is part of such a significant development, the CRISPR-Cas9.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemist","offset":61},{"uri":"CRISPR_gene_editing","surface_form":"CRISPR gene editing","offset":99},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Chemistry","offset":147},{"uri":"Emmanuelle_Charpentier","surface_form":"Emmanuelle Charpentier","offset":183}]}
