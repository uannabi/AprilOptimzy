Rohwer was a Japanese-American concentration camp at the time. She went to\u00A0 the University of Wisconsin but could not get a degree because of where she was from. After that, she went to Black Mountain College. Ever since she was a young girl, she showed an interest in art. She even drew in the mud when she was a child. Ruth is famous for making sculptures out of metal wire. \u201CMeandering lines and patterns, explorative variations of the same form or subject, and the most economical way to convey an image and characterize her work.\u201D She helped to found SCRAP, a recycling art program. This quote is saying that trying out different patterns and lines is the best way for her to make her work different from other people\u2019s work. Asawa also created the San Francisco School of Arts. Ruth believed that anybody who wanted to could do art and everyone had a part of them which was artistic. \u201CArt is for everyone. It is not something that you should have to go to the museums in order to see and enjoy.\u201Dsaid Asawa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
