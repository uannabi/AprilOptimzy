Sylvia Mclaughlin was best known for beginning and helping the movement to save the San Francisco Bay.\nMclaughlin was born in Denver, Colorado. George E. Cranmer and Jean Chappell Cranmer were her parents. She grew up in an area with an interesting environment. She left Denver and went to Vassar College in New York.\nShe returned to Denver and married Donald H. Mclaughlin. Soon enough, the couple moved to Berkeley, California. They started a family in California. When Sylvia saw the environment she lived she got mad. Pollution was ruining the Bay. This inspired Mclaughlin to start Save the Bay with two other women in 1961. Save the Bay gathered together many other passionate activists and stopped 2,000 acres of land in the Berkeley bay from being filled with cement. For almost forty years, Sylvia remained on the Save the Bay board. She also joined many other environment focused boards.\nHer work helped people learn about the environment of the bay and how to better protect it. Because of Mclaughlin, California is still very careful about maintaining the bay\u2019s healthy habitat and creating laws to further protect it.\nAfter many years of hard work, Sylvia Mclaughlin passed at age 99. We thank her for saving our bay and inspiring many younger generations to follow in her footsteps.\nAccomplishments.\nSylvia Mclaughlin was best known for beginning and fueling the movement to save the San Francisco Bay.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
