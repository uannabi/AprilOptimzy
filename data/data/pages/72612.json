They record wars against former vassal Tarhuntassa, and against Alasiya in Cyprus.\nAfter the fall, the Kaskians were probably in control of Hatti. Hattusa itself was destroyed, its site only re-occupied by a Phrygian fortress some 500 years later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tudhaliya_IV","surface_form":"Tudhaliya IV","offset":28},{"uri":"Hittite_Empire","surface_form":"Hittite Empire","offset":92},{"uri":"Hieroglyphics","surface_form":"hieroglyphics","offset":223},{"uri":"Cyprus","surface_form":"Cyprus","offset":313},{"uri":"Phrygian","surface_form":"Phrygian","offset":446}]}
