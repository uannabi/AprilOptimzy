There were five matches per decade, deciding who advances to the quarterfinal round of the tournament to compete for $1,000,000. The first decade aired in February 2014. The second one aired in March 2014. And the third aired in April 2014. The rest of the tournament (quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals) aired May 5-16, 2014.\nThe finals featured Ken Jennings against Brad Rutter and Roger Craig. At the time, Jennings was the biggest money winner on a game show. However, Rutter won the two-day final and the $1,000,000 top prize, reclaiming the game show record.\nRelated pages.\nJeopardy!
