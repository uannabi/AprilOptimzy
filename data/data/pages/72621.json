It was fought just after the Mithridatic Wars. The Romans were led by Lucius Caesennius Paetus. They were defeated by the Parthian-Armenian army led by Tiridates I of Armenia.\nThe Parthians made Tiridates the King of Armenia. He was the brother of the Parthian king Vologases I. Tiridates replaced Tigranes, a Roman ally, as king. The Romans fought to take back the throne, but were forced into surrender at Rhandeia (autumn 62).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":29},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":51},{"uri":"Parthia","surface_form":"Parthia","offset":63},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":83},{"uri":"Mithridatic_Wars","surface_form":"Mithridatic Wars","offset":126},{"uri":"Lucius_Caesennius_Paetus","surface_form":"Lucius Caesennius Paetus","offset":167},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":237},{"uri":"Tiridates_I_of_Armenia","surface_form":"Tiridates I of Armenia","offset":249},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"King","offset":306},{"uri":"Vologases_I","surface_form":"Vologases I","offset":363},{"uri":"Tigranes_the_Great","surface_form":"Tigranes","offset":395},{"uri":"Throne","surface_form":"throne","offset":463}]}
