It is near the city of Stepanavan in the Lori marz of Armenia. The monastery is on a hill within a gorge, near where the Dzoraget and Gargar rivers join.\nThe monastery was all rebuilt by lord Smbat of the House of Orbelian, a branch of the Liparitids who were removed to Armenia in the late 12th century from Georgia. Liparitids were themselves a branch of the Mamikonians. Smbat was the ancestor of the Armenian princes of Syunik. Georgian writings around the drum attests his name. The monastery has a gavit and various service buildings around the site. The government of Armenia has recently begun fixing the monastery. The broken dome of the main church has been restored entirely.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"7th_century","surface_form":"7th century","offset":37},{"uri":"Armenian_Apostolic_Church","surface_form":"Armenian Apostolic Church","offset":49},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastery","offset":75},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":101},{"uri":"Stepanavan","surface_form":"Stepanavan","offset":109},{"uri":"Lori","surface_form":"Lori","offset":127},{"uri":"Marz","surface_form":"marz","offset":132},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":140},{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":185},{"uri":"Dzoraget_(river)","surface_form":"Dzoraget","offset":207},{"uri":"Gargar","surface_form":"Gargar","offset":220},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":227},{"uri":"Orbelian_Dynasty","surface_form":"House of Orbelian","offset":291},{"uri":"Liparitids","surface_form":"Liparitids","offset":326},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":377},{"uri":"Georgia_(country)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":395},{"uri":"Mamikonian","surface_form":"Mamikonian","offset":447},{"uri":"Syunik","surface_form":"Syunik","offset":510},{"uri":"Georgian_language","surface_form":"Georgian","offset":518},{"uri":"Gavit","surface_form":"gavit","offset":590}]}
