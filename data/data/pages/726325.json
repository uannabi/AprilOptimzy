It has a database where scientists can put information for other people to read and use, especially information about molecules and the way they affect and create living things.\nAccording to its own website, NCBI's goal is to make it easier for people to invent new technology that can be used to study molecules and genes. It also sets up meetings for scientists to talk to each other, trains new scientists, develops computer-based ways of studying information, and conducts scientific research on its own.\nBeginning.\nIn 1988, United States Senator Claude Pepper proposed the law that would create NCBI, and the rest of the United States Congress passed it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_Institutes_of_Health","surface_form":"National Institutes of Health","offset":87},{"uri":"Genes","surface_form":"genes","offset":435},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":537}]}
