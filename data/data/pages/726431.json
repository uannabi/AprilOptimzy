{"id":726431,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowling_WLG","text":"Gowling WLG is a multinational law firm. It was formed by the merger of Canada-based Gowlings and UK-based Wragge Lawrence Graham & Co in February 2016. This was the first multinational law firm merger between British and Canadian firms. As of 2020, it is 16th on The Lawyer UK 200 list of best law firms.\nGowling WLG International Limited is an English company limited by guarantee. The two limited liability partnerships of Gowling WLG (Canada) LLP and Gowling WLG (UK) LLP are members of it. The two partnerships provide legal services. They are financially separate.\nThis is a fairly loose association, where each \"partner\" does the legal work for its own country. Therefore regulators in each country know who is responsible for any particular case.\nOffices.\nThe firm has 19 offices in Canada, the UK, continental Europe, the Middle East, China and Singapore. Gowling WLG plans to grow in Germany and East Asia in the near future.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Multinational_corporation","surface_form":"multinational","offset":17},{"uri":"Law_firm","surface_form":"law firm","offset":31},{"uri":"Merger","surface_form":"merger","offset":62},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":72},{"uri":"Gowlings","surface_form":"Gowlings","offset":85},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":98},{"uri":"Company_limited_by_guarantee","surface_form":"company limited by guarantee","offset":354},{"uri":"Limited_liability_partnership","surface_form":"limited liability partnership","offset":392},{"uri":"Finance","surface_form":"financially","offset":549},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":831},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":844},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":854},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":894},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":906}]}
