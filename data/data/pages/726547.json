On 13 December 2019, Corbyn announced that he would not lead the Labour Party into the next general election, following the party's poor performance in the December 2019 election.\nIt was won by Keir Starmer who received 56.2 per cent of the vote on the first round. It was held alongside the 2020 Labour Party deputy leadership election.\nBackground.\nJeremy Corbyn was elected Labour Party leader in a 2015 leadership election and re-elected leader in 2016 after a challenge from Owen Smith. While Labour gained seats in the 2017 general election, the party lost 60 seats in the 2019 election, its worst result since the 1935 general election. Corbyn announced that he would resign after a \"process of reflection\".\nTimetable.\nThe timetable for the election was set by the party's National Executive Committee on 6 January 2020.\nPLP and EPLP Nominations.\nCandidates first need to be nominated by at least 10% (twenty-two) of current Labour MPs and MEPs, who make up the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and the European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP).\nThe candidates who have passed this threshold need nominations from at least 5% (thirty-three) CLPs, or at least three affiliates including at least two trades unions that together represent at least 5% of affiliated members.\nThe table below shows the current number of nominations achieved by each candidate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jeremy_Corbyn","surface_form":"Jeremy Corbyn","offset":115},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":195},{"uri":"Next_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"next general election","offset":217},{"uri":"2019_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"December 2019 election","offset":286},{"uri":"Keir_Starmer","surface_form":"Keir Starmer","offset":324},{"uri":"2020_Labour_Party_deputy_leadership_election","surface_form":"2020 Labour Party deputy leadership election","offset":422},{"uri":"Jeremy_Corbyn","surface_form":"Jeremy Corbyn","offset":480},{"uri":"2015_Labour_Party_leadership_election_(UK)","surface_form":"2015 leadership election","offset":531},{"uri":"2016_Labour_Party_leadership_election_(UK)","surface_form":"re-elected leader in 2016","offset":560},{"uri":"Owen_Smith","surface_form":"Owen Smith","offset":609},{"uri":"2017_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"2017 general election","offset":654},{"uri":"2019_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"2019 election","offset":708},{"uri":"1935_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"1935 general election","offset":750},{"uri":"National_Executive_Committee","surface_form":"National Executive Committee","offset":909},{"uri":"Parliamentary_Labour_Party","surface_form":"Parliamentary Labour Party","offset":1098},{"uri":"European_Parliamentary_Labour_Party","surface_form":"European Parliamentary Labour Party","offset":1139}]}
