{"id":72659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kahn","text":"e=\"preserve\">Tony Kahn is an American radiohost, narrator, and writer who has won many awards. He is the son of Hollywood movie writer Gordon Kahn.\nEarly life.\nKahn was born in Los Angeles, California. His father was placed on a list of people with political beliefs that some people thought were not acceptable. This happened during a time in American history known as the Red Scare. The Red Scare is a term used to describe a time during the 1940s and 1950s in the United States when people were accused of (often wrongly) being communists.\nBecause of the Red Scare, Kahn had to leave Los Angeles with his family. They went to Mexico during the 1950s. They returned after a few years and Kahn went to school at Harvard University where he studied the Russian language. He graduated with very good grades. He then went to Columbia University where he got a masters degree -- an advanced academic degree or diploma -- in Slavic studies.\nCareer.\nTony Kahn is known for his work in radio. He produces and directs a radio show called \"Morning Stories\" for the radio station WGBH in Boston, Massachusetts. He has also contributed to other radio shows such as Minnesota Public Radio's \"The World\". On \"The World\", Kahn is sometimes the host and sometimes a reporter. He has won twelve New England Emmys, six Gold Medals of the New York International Festival and an award called the Edward R. Murrow Award for Feature Reporting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":29},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":38},{"uri":"Presenter","surface_form":"host","offset":43},{"uri":"Narrator","surface_form":"narrator","offset":49},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":63},{"uri":"Hollywood%2C_California","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":112},{"uri":"Screenwriter","surface_form":"movie writer","offset":122},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":177},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":190},{"uri":"Political","surface_form":"political","offset":249},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":353},{"uri":"Red_Scare","surface_form":"Red Scare","offset":374},{"uri":"1940s","surface_form":"1940s","offset":444},{"uri":"1950s","surface_form":"1950s","offset":454},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":467},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"communists","offset":531},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":629},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":703},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":713},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian language","offset":753},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduated","offset":774},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":823},{"uri":"Masters_degree","surface_form":"masters degree","offset":858},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"academic degree","offset":888},{"uri":"Degree_(school)","surface_form":"diploma","offset":907},{"uri":"Slavic_peoples","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":921},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"produces","offset":990},{"uri":"Radio_station","surface_form":"radio station","offset":1057},{"uri":"Boston","surface_form":"Boston","offset":1079},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":1087},{"uri":"Minnesota_Public_Radio","surface_form":"Minnesota Public Radio","offset":1155},{"uri":"Host","surface_form":"host","offset":1231},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"reporter","offset":1252},{"uri":"New_England_Emmy_Award","surface_form":"New England Emmys","offset":1280},{"uri":"New_York_International_Festival","surface_form":"New York International Festival","offset":1322},{"uri":"Edward_R._Murrow","surface_form":"Edward R.
