{"id":726780,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Gothic","text":"News Gothic is a sans-serif typeface made in 1908 by Morris Fuller Benton. The typeface was used by his company, American Type Founders. News Gothic is like Franklin Gothic, but much lighter.\nNews Gothic, like other typefaces made by Benton, is a grotesque model. It resembles other serif typefaces made in the time period. The letters are compact, and the descenders (like the tails of g and y) do not go down far. It is different from other sans-serif typefaces, because it is light and has more open letters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sans-serif","surface_form":"sans-serif","offset":17},{"uri":"Typeface","surface_form":"typeface","offset":28},{"uri":"Morris_Fuller_Benton","surface_form":"Morris Fuller Benton","offset":53},{"uri":"American_Type_Founders","surface_form":"American Type Founders","offset":113},{"uri":"Franklin_Gothic","surface_form":"Franklin Gothic","offset":157},{"uri":"Serif","surface_form":"serif","offset":283}]}
