{"id":72680,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond","text":"e=\"preserve\">A hydrogen bond is a low kind type of dipole-dipole bond that exists between an electronegative molecule and a hydrogen molecule bonded to another electronegative molecule. This type of bond always involves a hydrogen atom. That explains the name.\nHydrogen bonds can occur between molecules (\"intermolecularly\"), or within different parts of a single molecule (\"intramolecularly\"). The typical hydrogen bond is stronger than van der Waals forces, but weaker than covalent, ionic and metallic bonds.\nIntermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water (100\u00A0\u00B0C). Most molecules with hydrogen bonding have high boiling points and melting points. Because hydrogen bonds are what make water stick together so well, they also help other molecules that can make hydrogen bonds dissolve in water. This is because the molecules form bonds with the hydrogen in the water, too, helping them dissolve.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"bond","offset":65},{"uri":"Electronegative","surface_form":"electronegative","offset":93},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":124},{"uri":"Van_der_Waals_force","surface_form":"van der Waals force","offset":438},{"uri":"Covalent_bond","surface_form":"covalent","offset":476},{"uri":"Ionic_bond","surface_form":"ionic","offset":486},{"uri":"Metallic_bond","surface_form":"metallic bond","offset":496},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":589}]}
