{"id":726977,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_(record_label)","text":"Amiga is a popular music record label in Germany. It used to be a record label of the East German state-owned music publisher VEB Deutsche Schallplatten before becoming a record label of the Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994.\nIn 1947, actor and singer Ernst Busch became allowed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany to create a music publishing house, which was named Lied der Zeit GmbH (\"Song of the Times\"). This publishing company included the label Amiga. In the 1950s, Lied der Zeit became VEB Deutsche Schallplatten (\"German Records\"), a state-owned company that had a monopoly on making records. VEB Deutsche Schallplatten had multiple record labels, each for different genres; Amiga releases included folk, jazz, pop, rock, Schlager music, chanson, and children's music.\nAfter East Germany and West Germany became one country, most of the public state enterprises that were from East Germany were taken into pieces or sold to private investors. The Amiga label and catalog were obtained by Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994, which then became part of Sony Music Entertainment in 2008.\nAmiga's catalog has 2,200 albums and about 5,000 singles, or a total of 30,000 titles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Popular_music","surface_form":"popular music","offset":11},{"uri":"East_Germany","surface_form":"East German","offset":86},{"uri":"VEB_Deutsche_Schallplatten","surface_form":"VEB Deutsche Schallplatten","offset":126},{"uri":"Bertelsmann_Music_Group","surface_form":"Bertelsmann Music Group","offset":191},{"uri":"Ernst_Busch_(actor)","surface_form":"Ernst Busch","offset":250},{"uri":"Soviet_Military_Administration_in_Germany","surface_form":"Soviet Military Administration in Germany","offset":284},{"uri":"Gesellschaft_mit_beschr%C3%A4nkter_Haftung","surface_form":"GmbH","offset":392},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk","offset":719},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":725},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":736},{"uri":"Schlager_music","surface_form":"Schlager music","offset":742},{"uri":"Chanson","surface_form":"chanson","offset":758},{"uri":"Children%27s_music","surface_form":"children's music","offset":771},{"uri":"German_reunification","surface_form":"East Germany and West Germany became one country","offset":795},{"uri":"Sony_Music_Entertainment","surface_form":"Sony Music Entertainment","offset":1067}]}
