{"id":727049,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holozoa","text":"Holozoa is a group of living things that includes animals, and some single-celled relatives of animals. It excludes fungi. \"Holozoa\" is also an old name for the tunicate genus \"Distaplia\".\nHolozoa is a clade: a group of plants or animals with a common ancestor. It has all organisms close to animals.\"\nAn example of a well-known holozoan is the choanoflagellate, which looks a lot like the cells of a sponge. \"Proterospongia\" is an example of a choanoflagellate that might give clues as to how sponges evolved.\nEvolution.\nThe phylogenic tree (evolution tree) below shows how clades broke into newer clades. This includes Holozoa.{Clade|{clade","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animals","offset":50},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"single-celled","offset":68},{"uri":"Tunicate","surface_form":"tunicate","offset":161},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":170},{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"clade","offset":202},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestor","offset":252},{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organisms","offset":273},{"uri":"Choanoflagellate","surface_form":"choanoflagellate","offset":345},{"uri":"Proterospongia","surface_form":"Proterospongia","offset":410},{"uri":"Phylogeny","surface_form":"phylogenic tree","offset":526},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":543}]}
