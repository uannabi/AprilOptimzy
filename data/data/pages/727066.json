{"id":727066,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), also known as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum.\nWhen there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black stool.\nSmall amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out.\nSometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":110},{"uri":"Human_gastrointestinal_tract","surface_form":"gastrointestinal tract","offset":126},{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":159},{"uri":"Rectum","surface_form":"rectum","offset":172},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":206},{"uri":"Hematemesis","surface_form":"vomiting red blood","offset":257},{"uri":"Coffee_ground_vomiting","surface_form":"vomiting black blood","offset":277},{"uri":"Hematochezia","surface_form":"bloody stool","offset":299},{"uri":"Melena","surface_form":"black stool","offset":316},{"uri":"Iron-deficiency_anemia","surface_form":"iron-deficiency anemia","offset":382},{"uri":"Fatigue_(medical)","surface_form":"feeling tired","offset":418},{"uri":"Angina_pectoris","surface_form":"heart-related chest pain","offset":435},{"uri":"Abdominal_pain","surface_form":"abdominal pain","offset":488},{"uri":"Dyspnea","surface_form":"shortness of breath","offset":504},{"uri":"Pallor","surface_form":"pale skin","offset":525},{"uri":"Syncope_(medicine)","surface_form":"passing out","offset":539}]}
