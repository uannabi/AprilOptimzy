In every episode of the series, they appear in a sketch and perform a song.\nThe characters were said to be the most advanced ones when the series was first shown in 1996. Baxter Hobbins Slides, which was independent, used 3D motion-capture suits with motion sensors to make animated 3D models so the characters could make the same movements as the actors. These 3D models were wireframe models at first, then skin and clothes were added to them. The lip movements of the characters were done by using the real lip movements of the actors filmed behind a blue screen.\nThe voices in the sketches were later replaced with a version in French for Quinze Minutes Plus (Juju et Juliette), and a version in Spanish for Revista (Julio y Julia).\nThe characters (mostly Rolli) and the music videos for 'Wann Hast Du Geburtstag?' and \u2018Was Ist Dein Lieblingsfach?\u2019 later became a small meme, due to Rolli's dance movements being very big.\nRolli was voiced by Frido Ruth. Rita was voiced by Nina Hamm, except for the singing parts, which were voiced by Christina Fry, a professional actress, singer, voice-over artist, comedienne, writer, presenter and cabaretist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":18},{"uri":"Educational_television","surface_form":"educational television","offset":59},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":105},{"uri":"Goethe-Institut","surface_form":"Goethe-Institut","offset":117},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":165},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":624},{"uri":"Take_That","surface_form":"Take That","offset":3282},{"uri":"Berlin_U-Bahn","surface_form":"U-Bahn","offset":3572},{"uri":"McDonald%27s","surface_form":"McDonald's","offset":4526},{"uri":"Ostsee","surface_form":"Ostsee","offset":7091},{"uri":"Confirmation","surface_form":"Confirmation","offset":7185},{"uri":"KaDaWe","surface_form":"KaDeWe","offset":7700},{"uri":"Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church","surface_form":"Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church","offset":7746},{"uri":"Kreuzberg","surface_form":"Kreuzberg","offset":7892},{"uri":"Berlin_Wall","surface_form":"Berlin Wall","offset":7984},{"uri":"Potsdamer_Platz","surface_form":"Potsdamer Platz","offset":8027},{"uri":"Computer_animation","surface_form":"animated using computers","offset":8290},{"uri":"Motion_capture","surface_form":"motion-capture","offset":8541},{"uri":"Chroma_key","surface_form":"blue screen","offset":8870},{"uri":"Frido_Ruth","surface_form":"Frido Ruth","offset":9263},{"uri":"Nina_Hamm","surface_form":"Nina Hamm","offset":9294},{"uri":"Christina_Fry","surface_form":"Christina Fry","offset":9356},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"comedienne","offset":9422},{"uri":"Caberet","surface_form":"cabaretist","offset":9456}]}
