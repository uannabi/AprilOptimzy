{"id":727365,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filozoa","text":"Filozoa is a clade (a group of plants or animals with a common ancestor) that is in the Opisthokonta clade. It includes animals, and their close single-celled relatives. These relatives are more closely related to animals than they are to fungi, and other Opisthokonts.\nThree groups are in Filozoa: Filasterea, Choanoflagellatea, and Kingdom Animalia. Animalia is the most important one, which has all proper animals in it.\nEvolution.\nThe phylogenic tree (evolution tree) below shows how clades broke into newer clades. This includes Filozoa.{Clade|{clade","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"clade","offset":13},{"uri":"Opisthokont","surface_form":"Opisthokonta","offset":88},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"single-celled","offset":145},{"uri":"Fungus","surface_form":"fungi","offset":239},{"uri":"Filasterea","surface_form":"Filasterea","offset":299},{"uri":"Choanoflagellate","surface_form":"Choanoflagellatea","offset":311},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"Animalia","offset":342},{"uri":"Phylogeny","surface_form":"phylogenic tree","offset":439},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":456}]}
