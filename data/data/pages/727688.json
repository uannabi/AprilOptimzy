{"id":727688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)","text":"Divergent means that as you add more terms the sum never stops getting bigger. It does not go towards a single finite value.\nInfinite means that you can always add another term. There is no final term to the series.\nIts name comes from the idea of harmonics in music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are,, etc., of the string's fundamental wavelength. Apart from the first term, every term of the series is the harmonic mean of the terms either side of it. The phrase \"harmonic mean\" also comes from music.\nHistory.\nThe fact that the harmonic series diverges was first proven in the 14th century by Nicole Oresme, but was forgotten. Proofs were given in the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jacob Bernoulli.\nHarmonic sequences have been used by architects. In the Baroque period architects used them in the proportions of floor plans, elevations, and in the relationships between architectural details of churches and palaces.\nDivergence.\nThere are several well-known proofs of the divergence of the harmonic series. A few of them are given below.\nComparison test.\nIt follows (by the comparison test) that the sum of the harmonic series must be infinite as well. More precisely, the comparison above proves that\nfor every positive integer.\nThis proof, proposed by Nicole Oresme in around 1350, is considered to be a high point of medieval mathematics. It is still a standard proof taught in mathematics classes today.\nIntegral test.\nSince this area is entirely contained within the rectangles, the total area of the rectangles must be infinite as well. This proves that\nThe generalization of this argument is known as the integral test.\nRate of divergence.\nThe harmonic series diverges very slowly. For example, the sum of the first 1043 terms is less than 100. This is because the partial sums of the series have logarithmic growth. In particular,\nPartial sums.\nThe finite partial sums of the diverging harmonic series,\nare called harmonic numbers.\nThe difference between and converges to the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant. The difference between any two harmonic numbers is never an integer. No harmonic numbers are integers, except for.\nAlternating harmonic series.\nThe alternating harmonic series, while conditionally convergent, is not absolutely convergent: if the terms in the series are systematically rearranged, in general the sum becomes different and, dependent on the rearrangement, possibly even infinite.\nThe alternating harmonic series formula is a special case of the Mercator series, the Taylor series for the natural logarithm.\nThis is known as the Leibniz series.\nGeneral harmonic series.\nThe general harmonic series is of the form\nwhere and are real numbers, and is not zero or a negative integer.\nBy the limit comparison test with the harmonic series, all general harmonic series also diverge.\n-series.\nA generalization of the harmonic series is the -series (or hyperharmonic series), defined as\nfor any real number. When, the -series is the harmonic series, which diverges. Either the integral test or the Cauchy condensation test shows that the -series converges for all (in which case it is called the over-harmonic series) and diverges for all. If then the sum of the -series is, i.e., the Riemann zeta function evaluated at.\nThe problem of finding the sum for is called the Basel problem; Leonhard Euler showed it is. The value of the sum for is called Ap\u00E9ry's constant, since Roger Ap\u00E9ry proved that it is an irrational number.\nln-series.\nRelated to the -series is the ln-series, defined as\nfor any positive real number. This can be shown by the integral test to diverge for but converge for all.\n-series.\nFor any convex, real-valued function such that\nRandom harmonic series.\nwhere the are independent, identically distributed random variables taking the values +1 and \u22121 with equal probability, is a well-known example in probability theory for a series of random variables that converges with probability 1. The fact of this convergence is an easy consequence of either the Kolmogorov three-series theorem or of the closely related Kolmogorov maximal inequality. Byron Schmuland of the University of Alberta further examined the properties of the random harmonic series, and showed that the convergent series is a random variable with some interesting properties. In particular, the probability density function of this random variable evaluated at +2 or at \u22122 takes on the value..., differing from by less than 10\u221242. Schmuland's paper explains why this probability is so close to, but not exactly. The exact value of this probability is given by the infinite cosine product integral divided by.\nDepleted harmonic series.\nThe depleted harmonic series where all of the terms in which the digit 9 appears anywhere in the denominator are removed can be shown to converge and its value is less than 80. In fact, when all the terms containing any particular string of digits (in any base) are removed the series converges.\nApplications.\nThe harmonic series can be counterintuitive. This is because it is a divergent series even though the terms of the series get smaller and go towards zero. The divergence of the harmonic series is the source of some paradoxes.\nBecause the series gets arbitrarily large as becomes larger, eventually this ratio must exceed 1, which implies that the worm reaches the end of the rubber band. However, the value of at which this occurs must be extremely large: approximately, a number exceeding 1043 minutes (1037 years). Although the harmonic series does diverge, it does so very slowly.\nCalculating the sum shows that the time required to get to the speed of light is only 97\u00A0seconds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Harmonics_(music)","surface_form":"harmonics in music","offset":248},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":272},{"uri":"Overtone","surface_form":"overtone","offset":291},{"uri":"Fundamental_frequency","surface_form":"fundamental wavelength","offset":351},{"uri":"Harmonic_mean","surface_form":"harmonic mean","offset":434},{"uri":"Nicole_Oresme","surface_form":"Nicole Oresme","offset":622},{"uri":"Pietro_Mengoli","surface_form":"Pietro Mengoli","offset":697},{"uri":"Johann_Bernoulli","surface_form":"Johann Bernoulli","offset":713},{"uri":"Jacob_Bernoulli","surface_form":"Jacob Bernoulli","offset":735},{"uri":"Architect","surface_form":"architect","offset":789},{"uri":"Baroque","surface_form":"Baroque","offset":808},{"uri":"Proportion_(architecture)","surface_form":"proportions","offset":851},{"uri":"Direct_comparison_test","surface_form":"comparison test","offset":1128},{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive","offset":1266},{"uri":"Integer","surface_form":"integer","offset":1275},{"uri":"Nicole_Oresme","surface_form":"Nicole Oresme","offset":1308},{"uri":"Integral_test","surface_form":"integral test","offset":1666},{"uri":"Logarithmic_growth","surface_form":"logarithmic growth","offset":1858},{"uri":"Harmonic_number","surface_form":"harmonic number","offset":1976},{"uri":"Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant","surface_form":"Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant","offset":2038},{"uri":"Conditional_convergence","surface_form":"conditionally convergent","offset":2248},{"uri":"Absolute_convergence","surface_form":"absolutely convergent","offset":2281},{"uri":"Mercator_series","surface_form":"Mercator series","offset":2525},{"uri":"Taylor_series","surface_form":"Taylor series","offset":2546},{"uri":"Leibniz_series","surface_form":"Leibniz series","offset":2608},{"uri":"Integral_test","surface_form":"integral test","offset":3048},{"uri":"Cauchy_condensation_test","surface_form":"Cauchy condensation test","offset":3069},{"uri":"Riemann_zeta_function","surface_form":"Riemann zeta function","offset":3256},{"uri":"Basel_problem","surface_form":"Basel problem","offset":3341},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonhard Euler","offset":3356},{"uri":"Ap%C3%A9ry%27s_constant","surface_form":"Ap\u00E9ry's constant","offset":3420},{"uri":"Roger_Ap%C3%A9ry","surface_form":"Roger Ap\u00E9ry","offset":3444},{"uri":"Irrational_number","surface_form":"irrational number","offset":3477},{"uri":"Convex_function","surface_form":"convex","offset":3682},{"uri":"Statistical_independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":3759},{"uri":"Almost_surely","surface_form":"with probability 1","offset":3959},{"uri":"Kolmogorov%27s_three-series_theorem","surface_form":"Kolmogorov three-series theorem","offset":4045},{"uri":"Kolmogorov%27s_inequality","surface_form":"Kolmogorov maximal inequality","offset":4103},{"uri":"Random_variable","surface_form":"random variable","offset":4285},{"uri":"Probability_density_function","surface_form":"probability density function","offset":4354},{"uri":"Number_base","surface_form":"base","offset":4950},{"uri":"Counterintuitive","surface_form":"counterintuitive","offset":5031},{"uri":"Divergent_series","surface_form":"divergent series","offset":5073},{"uri":"Paradox","surface_form":"paradox","offset":5219}]}
