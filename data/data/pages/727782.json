{"id":727782,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orsinian_Tales","text":"\"Orsinian Tales\" is a collection of eleven short stories by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Most of them happen in Le Guin's imaginary country called Orsinia.\nMost of the stories do not share events or characters. All the stories are emotional personal events. Many are romantic. Larger political events such as wars and revolutions are happening in all of the stories. Le Guin writes about each person's right to his or her own thoughts and emotions. In the stories, Le Guin shows that these emotions should not be controlled by society, rules, or the State.\nOrsinia.\nThe stories are set in a fictional country somewhere in Central Europe. Stories happen between 1150-1965. \"Orsinia\"is in Le Guin's earliest writings, Le Guin invented Orsinia when she was a young adult learning to write. The names Orsinia and Ursula both come from the Latin word \"ursus\" meaning \"bear\" (\"ursula\" = diminutive of \"ursa\" \"female bear\"; \"ursinus\" = \"bear-like\"). Le Guin once said that since Orsinia was her own country it should have her name.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ursula_K._Le_Guin","surface_form":"Ursula K.
