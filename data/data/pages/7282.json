{"id":7282,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow","text":"Glasgow (Scottish: \"Glaschu\", Lowland Scots: \"Glesga\") is the biggest and busiest city in Scotland. It is on the banks of the River Clyde. People from Glasgow are known as \"Glaswegians\" (\"glas-wee-jans\"), which is a name also used for words that are used only in Glasgow - also known as \"The Glasgow Patter\".\nThe number of people living in Glasgow is 621,020 (2017 estimate) and\n626,410 (2019 estimate). Many more people live in the areas round the city. There are 1,209,143 people living in the Greater Glasgow urban area. The wider metropolitan area is home to over 1,670,000 people, about 33% of Scotland's population.\nThe number of people living inside the city proper used to be much higher. Starting in the early 1960s the old tenements were pulled down and new housing built further out (high-rise blocks were the fashion of the day). Now there is nowhere near the number of people living in Glasgow as during the famous times of the shipyards on the River Clyde. It was said to be the second biggest city in the world after London at one point in the 1800s.\nMany people from other countries visit Glasgow for holidays and trips; most of these people are from Europe France, America (the US and Canada) for weekend and week trips.\nTwo airports serve the city, Glasgow International Airport and Prestwick Airport. The main railway stations in the city are Glasgow Central and Queen Street stations. They provide rail links to the rest of Scotland, to the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe.\nThere are a number of theatres and concert halls in the city. These include the SECC (Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre), the Royal Concert hall, the King's Theatre, the Pavilion Theatre and the Theatre Royal.\nGlasgow has several football teams - the best known are Rangers F.C. and Celtic F.C.. Partick Thistle, Clydebank, and Queens Park F.C. also play in the city.\nGlasgow has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\" in the Koeppen climate classification). The weather in Glasgow is almost always changing, and it is hard to say what the entire day's weather is like. Very often, the weather is worst in the morning when it is mostly damp and sometimes misty or even foggy; the Glasgow Patter also refers to \"dreich\" weather - damp and drizzly. However, the weather mostly improves through the afternoon and more often than not the weather stays dry and at an average temperature.\nIn summer it is popular as a base for tourists. They can stay in Glasgow and then travel to see Loch Lomond and the Western Isles. One of the oldest paddle-steamer boats is in Glasgow, and in the summer one can travel down the Clyde to visit other towns and islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lowland_Scots","surface_form":"Lowland Scots","offset":30},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":90},{"uri":"River_Clyde","surface_form":"River Clyde","offset":126},{"uri":"Greater_Glasgow","surface_form":"Greater Glasgow","offset":496},{"uri":"Glasgow_City_Region","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":534},{"uri":"Tenement","surface_form":"tenement","offset":733},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1032},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1174},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"America","offset":1182},{"uri":"US","surface_form":"US","offset":1195},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1202},{"uri":"Glasgow_International_Airport","surface_form":"Glasgow International Airport","offset":1267},{"uri":"Prestwick_Airport","surface_form":"Prestwick Airport","offset":1301},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":1329},{"uri":"Glasgow_Central","surface_form":"Glasgow Central","offset":1362},{"uri":"Queen_Street","surface_form":"Queen Street","offset":1382},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1473},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1492},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"football","offset":1738},{"uri":"Rangers_F.C.","surface_form":"Rangers F.C.","offset":1774},{"uri":"Celtic_F.C.","surface_form":"Celtic F.C.","offset":1791},{"uri":"Partick_Thistle","surface_form":"Partick Thistle","offset":1804},{"uri":"Clydebank","surface_form":"Clydebank","offset":1821},{"uri":"Queens_Park_F.C.","surface_form":"Queens Park F.C.","offset":1836},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":1891},{"uri":"Koeppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"Koeppen climate classification","offset":1921},{"uri":"Lowland_Scots","surface_form":"Glasgow Patter","offset":2175},{"uri":"Loch_Lomond","surface_form":"Loch Lomond","offset":2474},{"uri":"Western_Isles","surface_form":"Western Isles","offset":2494}]}
