{"id":72834,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology","text":"e=\"preserve\">Molecular biology is the study of biology at a molecular level. The field overlaps with other areas of biology and chemistry, particularly cell biology, genetics, biophysics and biochemistry.\nMolecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":47},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecular","offset":60},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":116},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":128},{"uri":"Cell_biology","surface_form":"cell biology","offset":152},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":166},{"uri":"Biophysics","surface_form":"biophysics","offset":176},{"uri":"Biochemistry","surface_form":"biochemistry","offset":191},{"uri":"Cell","surface_form":"cell","offset":316},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":357},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":362},{"uri":"Protein_biosynthesis","surface_form":"protein biosynthesis","offset":370}]}
