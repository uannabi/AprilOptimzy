It was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks.\nAlthough it came out after \"Fallout 4\", \"Fallout 76\" is not a sequel. It takes place earlier than all of the other \"Fallout\" games, more like a prequel.\n\"Fallout 76\" was made using the Creation Engine, just like \"Fallout 4\". It is also the first \"Fallout\" game made by Bethesda Game Studios that includes multiplayer.
