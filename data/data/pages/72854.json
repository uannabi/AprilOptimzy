{"id":72854,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennes_%26_Mauritz","text":"H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M), is a Swedish clothing company. It sells fast fashion at cheaper prices. The company was created in V\u00E4ster\u00E5s, Sweden, in 1947 by Erling Persson. At first, the company only sold women's clothing. At that time, it was called Hennes, Swedish for \"hers.\" In 1968, Persson got the building and inventory of a Stockholm hunting equipment store named Mauritz Widforss. A supply of men's clothing was part of the inventory. This caused Persson to decide to also sell men's clothing. He renamed the store Hennes & Mauritz, later shortened to H&M.\nH&M has more than 1500 stores in 28 different countries. It has more than 60,000 employees.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":38},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":46},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":55},{"uri":"Fast_fashion","surface_form":"fast fashion","offset":73},{"uri":"V%C3%A4ster%C3%A5s","surface_form":"V\u00E4ster\u00E5s","offset":132},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":263},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":308},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":336},{"uri":"Hunt","surface_form":"hunt","offset":346},{"uri":"Equipment","surface_form":"equipment","offset":354},{"uri":"Store","surface_form":"store","offset":364},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":616},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":651}]}
