It was made by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay. It was a sequel to \"Fallout\", and the second game in the \"Fallout\" series. It had very similar graphics and gameplay to the first \"Fallout\", but a larger world and longer story.\nThe sequel to \"Fallout 2\" was not made by Black Isle Studios because Bethesda Softworks bought the \"Fallout\" series. Eventually Bethesda Game Studios made \"Fallout 3\" in 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Black_Isle_Studios","surface_form":"Black Isle Studios","offset":130},{"uri":"Interplay","surface_form":"Interplay","offset":166},{"uri":"Fallout_(video_game)","surface_form":"Fallout","offset":197},{"uri":"Fallout_(series)","surface_form":"\"Fallout\" series","offset":234},{"uri":"Black_Isle_Studios","surface_form":"Black Isle Studios","offset":397},{"uri":"Bethesda_Softworks","surface_form":"Bethesda Softworks","offset":424},{"uri":"Bethesda_Game_Studios","surface_form":"Bethesda Game Studios","offset":483},{"uri":"Fallout_3","surface_form":"Fallout 3","offset":511}]}
