If it is hit too hard, it makes a very bad sound. It is often used to represent things such as fairies, birds, and butterflies. It originates in Germany.\nCategories: Percussion instruments, musical instruments, German musical instruments,","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Percussion_instrument","surface_form":"percussion instrument","offset":22},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":62},{"uri":"Xylophone","surface_form":"xylophone","offset":98},{"uri":"Timpani","surface_form":"timpani","offset":112},{"uri":"Range_(music)","surface_form":"range","offset":135},{"uri":"Octave","surface_form":"octave","offset":157},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":184},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":253},{"uri":"Mallets","surface_form":"mallets","offset":323},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":338},{"uri":"Felt","surface_form":"felt","offset":349},{"uri":"Pitch_(music)","surface_form":"pitch","offset":403},{"uri":"Fairy","surface_form":"fairies","offset":505},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":514},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterflies","offset":525},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":555},{"uri":"Categories","surface_form":"Categories","offset":564},{"uri":"Percussion","surface_form":"Percussion","offset":576},{"uri":"Musical_instruments","surface_form":"musical instruments","offset":600},{"uri":"German_musical_instruments","surface_form":"German musical instruments","offset":621}]}
