{"id":728891,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicka_Chicka_Boom_Boom","text":"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" is a bestselling American children's book written by Bill Martin, Jr. and John Archambault, illustrated by Lois Ehlert, and published by Simon & Schuster in 1989. The book features anthropomorphized letters.\nSummary.\nThe lowercase letters climb a coconut tree in alphabetical order, until their weight causes the tree to bend so much that they all tumble out of the tree. Capital letters (the older relatives of the letters climbing the tree) come to help them. Again alphabetically, it describes each letter's injury.\nAt night, letter A comes back and climbs up the coconut tree, daring the other letters to catch him.\nAn audio book version is also available, narrated by Ray Charles.\nA CD-ROM version was released in 1995 by Davidson and Simon & Schuster Interactive.\nIt inspired a 2004 sequel, \"Chicka, Chicka, 1, 2, 3\". A board book for toddlers, entitled \"Chicka, Chicka ABC\" was published in 1990, containing the first half of the full story, which ends up with all 26 letters falling out of the tree.\nWeston Woods made an animated musical short film adaptation of the original book, with music composed and performed by Crystal Taliefero.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":43},{"uri":"Children%27s_book","surface_form":"children's book","offset":52},{"uri":"Bill_Martin%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"Bill Martin, Jr.","offset":79},{"uri":"John_Archambault","surface_form":"John Archambault","offset":100},{"uri":"Lois_Ehlert","surface_form":"Lois Ehlert","offset":133},{"uri":"Simon_%26amp%3B_Schuster","surface_form":"Simon & Schuster","offset":163},{"uri":"Anthropomorphism","surface_form":"anthropomorphized","offset":207},{"uri":"Letter_(alphabet)","surface_form":"letters","offset":225}]}
