Jordan as the supervillain Killmonger.\nPlot.\nThousands of years ago an asteroid crashes into an African country called Wakanda containing an alien metal called vibranium which absorbs vibrations and is the world\u2019s strongest metal as a result. The tribes of Wakanda went to war for the vibranium but then decided to unite under the leadership of a king called the Black Panther. Only one tribe goes into exile in the mountains of Wakanda so that they do not have to be ruled by the Black Panther. Because of using vibranium to make weapons the Wakandans managed to stop anyone else from ever conquering their country and as a result they became the world\u2019s most technologically advanced nation but kept that a secret from everyone else by creating a giant force field around the country and having no relationship with the outside world. Then in the late 20th century T\u2019chaka, King of Wakanda finds out that his brother who is an undercover spy in the United States is secretly smuggling vibranium to the US to help oppressed black people to overthrow the white man. T\u2019chaka then kills his brother and leaves his body unburied to return to Wakanda. T\u2019chaka\u2019s brother\u2019s son finds his father\u2019s body dead and swears to get revenge. Then in 2018, T\u2019chaka\u2019s son T\u2019challa comes back to Wakanda to become the new king following T\u2019chaka\u2019s murder in the movie. M\u2019baku comes from the mountains and challenges T\u2019challa to a fight to become Black Panther. T\u2019challa wins and convinces M\u2019Baku to surrender so that he doesn\u2019t have to kill him. T\u2019challa\u2019s cousin turns out to have joined the American army and worked as an assassin for the CIA known as Killmonger. He since left the CIA and hired a supervillain named Klaue to help him rob the British Museum of its Wakandan artifacts and then murder everyone there. T\u2019challa finds out that Klaue is in South Korea and goes there as the Black Panther to try and capture him only to find himself fighting the CIA. Klaue is captured by CIA agent Everett Ross with T\u2019challa\u2019s help and Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda is actually a rich country. Klaue escapes with Killmonger\u2019s help and Ross is hurt. T\u2019challa takes Ross to Wakanda so that his doctors can fix him. Killmonger then gets Klaue to take him to Wakanda only to reveal to Klaue that he is actually a Wakandan prince and kills Klaue. He then delivers Klaue\u2019s body to Wakanda in exchange for an audience with T\u2019challa and demand the throne. Killmonger and T\u2019challa fight to the death and Killmonger wins. Killmonger becomes King of Wakanda and then wants to use the Wakandan military to conquer all white people in the world and punish them for their crimes against black people. T\u2019challa\u2019s family reaches out to M\u2019baku and asks him to fight Killmonger. M\u2019baku reveals that T\u2019challa survived the fight without having surrendered and that he rescued an injured T\u2019challa to repay him for having spared his life. T\u2019challa is healed by M\u2019baku and T\u2019challa confronts Killmonger. Killmonger has no plan to fight T\u2019challa since he believes that now that he is king there is no need for violence. T\u2019challa tries to get the throne back by fighting to the death against Killmonger and wins. T\u2019challa then decides to share Wakanda\u2019s technology with the world.\nReception.\nThe Black Panther movie was generally praised by the critics and was actually nominated for an Oscar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Superhero_movie","surface_form":"superhero movie","offset":39},{"uri":"Marvel_Cinematic_Universe","surface_form":"Marvel Cinematic Universe","offset":66},{"uri":"Chadwick_Boseman","surface_form":"Chadwick Boseman","offset":105},{"uri":"Michael_B._Jordan","surface_form":"Michael B.
