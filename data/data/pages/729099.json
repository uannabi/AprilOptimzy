{"id":729099,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Hotel_(Los_Angeles)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Cecil Hotel is a hotel in downtown Los Angeles. It opened in 1927. It is in a poorer part of the city, and many deaths and violent acts have happened there. For example, the dead body of a Canadian student, Elisa Lam, was found on the hotel roof in 2013. The hotel changed its name to Stay on Main Hotel in order to distance itself from its dark past. Because of this, the hotel is also called \"The Suicide.\"\nAt least 11 people killed themselves in the hotel.\nAs of 2019, the hotel has 301 rooms for people who want to live there for a long time and 299 hotel rooms. Some of the hotel rooms are regular private hotel rooms and some are meant to be like a European hostel, where people who didn't know each other would be expected to share the room. The owners are currently rebuilding the hotel to make it nicer and newer. They plan for it to have 30 fewer rooms in 2021 to make space for other things.\nThe Cecil Hotel was part of the inspiration for the fifth season of the television show \"American Horror Story\", which took place in a haunted hotel.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":52},{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":206},{"uri":"Death_of_Elisa_Lam","surface_form":"Elisa Lam","offset":224}]}
