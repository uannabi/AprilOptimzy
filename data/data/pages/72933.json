Its members are elected by all Irish citizens of voting age (which is now 18). Members of D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann are called \"Teachta Dala\" (TD).\nFirst D\u00E1il.\nThe First D\u00E1il was elected at the British General election of 1918. The Sinn F\u00E9in people who were elected did not go to the House of Commons. Instead they stayed in Dublin and set up the First D\u00E1il.\nThe First D\u00E1il passed the Declaration of Independence of the Irish Republic, a Constitution, and set up a government.\nThe first British woman MP was Countess Markiewicz. Because she was a Sinn F\u00E9iner, she went to the first D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann instead. That is why many people think Lady Astor was Britain's first woman MP.\nSecond D\u00E1il.\nIn 1922, during the War of Independence, the British passed the Government of Ireland Act. The act set up two parliaments, one for Northern Ireland and one for Southern Ireland. There was no election in Southern Ireland because only Sinn F\u00E9in candidates stood. They did not meet as the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. Instead they, and the only Sinn Feiner elected only in Northern Ireland met as the Second D\u00E1il.\nOn the first day of the Second D\u00E1il \u00C9amon de Valera, President of the Irish Republic, said there would be no need to fight or negotiate with Britain if the British prime minister remembered that he had said De Valera said that if Poland had the right to its own government, so did Ireland.\nThe Second D\u00E1il ratified (that is, confirmed) the Anglo-Irish Treaty, by a vote of 64 to 57. After this the 64 pro-treaty members met as the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, with the four University MPs, and voted to accept the treaty again.\nThird D\u00E1il.\nThe Third D\u00E1il was two things.\nThe Third D\u00E1il passed the constitution of the Irish Free State, and after 6 December 1922, it was the lower house of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State.\nD\u00E1il Debates.\nThe official record of everything said in the D\u00E1il is called or. Volume (book) one starts on the day the Third D\u00E1il met, so the record of the First D\u00E1il is called Book F, and the Second D\u00E1il starts with book S.\nElection of the D\u00E1il.\nTDs are elected in multi-member constituencies, unlike the British House of Commons or the American House of Representatives, which are single-member constituencies. There can be three, four, or five TDs in each constituency. Voters can vote for as many candidates as they want, but they rank them in order of preference, 1,2,3...\nWorking out who has been elected can sometimes take two or even three days, because the votes are counted several times under the Single Transferable Vote system.\nIf the Chairman of D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann, called the Ceann Comhairle, wants to stand for re-election he is does not have to be elected. The law and the constitution say that he is given a seat in his old constituency.\nPowers of D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann.\nThe Dail is the more powerful of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.\nThe Taoiseach, (Prime Minister), the T\u00E1naiste (deputy prime minister) and the Minister of Finance must be members of D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann.\nBills to raise tax have to start in the D\u00E1il, and cannot be vetoed by the Seanad.\nThe D\u00E1il can pass a bill even if the Seanad objects, but the Supreme Court can decide that the act is not allowed by the Constitution. The President can also ask the Supreme Court if the bill is not allowed by the constitution before he/she signs it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Opposition_Front_Bench_(Ireland)","surface_form":"Opposition","offset":0},{"uri":"Oireachtas","surface_form":"parliament of Ireland","offset":89},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"elected","offset":128},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":143},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":149},{"uri":"Teachta_Dala","surface_form":"Teachta Dala","offset":227},{"uri":"First_D%C3%A1il","surface_form":"First D\u00E1il","offset":263},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":293},{"uri":"General_election","surface_form":"General election","offset":301},{"uri":"Sinn_F%C3%A9in","surface_form":"Sinn F\u00E9in","offset":331},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":383},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":424},{"uri":"Irish_Republic","surface_form":"Irish Republic","offset":519},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":537},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"MP","offset":600},{"uri":"Constance_Georgine%2C_Countess_Markiewicz","surface_form":"Countess Markiewicz","offset":607},{"uri":"Irish_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"War of Independence","offset":807},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":918},{"uri":"Southern_Ireland","surface_form":"Southern Ireland","offset":947},{"uri":"Southern_Ireland","surface_form":"Southern Ireland","offset":990},{"uri":"Second_D%C3%A1il","surface_form":"Second D\u00E1il","offset":1194},{"uri":"Third_D%C3%A1il","surface_form":"Third D\u00E1il","offset":1760},{"uri":"Irish_Free_State","surface_form":"Irish Free State","offset":1833},{"uri":"Oireachtas_of_the_Irish_Free_State","surface_form":"Oireachtas of the Irish Free State","offset":1908},{"uri":"TD","surface_form":"TD","offset":2191},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":2258},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":2282},{"uri":"House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":2291},{"uri":"Single_Transferable_Vote","surface_form":"Single Transferable Vote","offset":2652},{"uri":"Ceann_Comhairle","surface_form":"Ceann Comhairle","offset":2729},{"uri":"Oireachtas","surface_form":"Oireachtas","offset":2973},{"uri":"Taoiseach","surface_form":"Taoiseach","offset":2989},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":3001},{"uri":"T%C3%A1naiste","surface_form":"T\u00E1naiste","offset":3022},{"uri":"Veto","surface_form":"veto","offset":3176},{"uri":"Seanad_%C3%89ireann","surface_form":"Seanad","offset":3235},{"uri":"Bunreacht_na_h%C3%89ireann","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":3319},{"uri":"President_of_Ireland","surface_form":"President","offset":3337}]}
