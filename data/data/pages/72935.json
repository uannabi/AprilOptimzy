The term \"prime minister\" is not used by the Irish media.\nAppointment.\nWhen a new D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann meets after an election it nominates one of its members to be Taoiseach. He then visits the President, and is appointed. He then presents a list of ministers to the D\u00E1il and when this is approved they are also appointed by the President.\nIf the Taoiseach resigns all members of the government are said to have resigned as well. If a minister does not resign when asked by the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach can ask the President to sack the minister. The President cannot refuse to do this.\nDepartment of the Taoiseach.\nThe Department of the Taoiseach helps the Taoiseach to do his job. The main duty of the Taoiseach is to start policy and coordinate policy of the rest of government. Especially policies on Economic and Social Development, Northern Ireland, the European Union and Public Sector Change and Oireachtas Reform.\nThe Government Chief Whip, who has to make sure the government's policies and ideas are turned into law, is a part of the Taoiseach's department.\nThe current Taoiseach is Leo Varadkar since 14 June 2017.\nPresident of the Executive Council.\n!colspan=2 width=15% |Vice President","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":88},{"uri":"President_of_Ireland","surface_form":"President","offset":284},{"uri":"Leo_Varadkar","surface_form":"Leo Varadkar","offset":1184},{"uri":"Vice-President_of_the_Executive_Council_of_the_Irish_Free_State","surface_form":"Vice President","offset":1275}]}
