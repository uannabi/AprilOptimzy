The movie is inspired by a story told to Mendes by his paternal grandfather, Alfred Mendes, about his time serving in World War I. Taking place soon after the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and Operation Alberich, the movie is about two young British soldiers who were given a mission to deliver a message calling off a doomed offensive attack. This message is especially important to one of the soldiers because his brother will be part of the attack.\nThe project was officially announced in June 2018, with MacKay and Chapman signing on in October and the rest of the cast the following March. Filming took place from April to June 2019 in the UK, with cinematographer Roger Deakins and editor Lee Smith using long takes to have the entire movie appear as two continuous shots.\n\"1917\" premiered in the UK on 4 December 2019 and was released theatrically in the United States on 25 December by Universal Pictures and in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2020 by Entertainment One.
