{"id":729594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_(1982_movie)","text":"Remembrance is a drama about Royal Navy ratings of HMS \"Raleigh\". They are about to go on a six-month naval exercise. Some well-known British actors had early roles in the film. They include Timothy Spall, Lisa Maxwell and John Altman. It was Gary Oldman's first film.\nIt was made by Channel Four Films and was shown in the first week of Channel 4 broadcasting. It was also one of the first films in the UK to be shown on television less than three years after its initial cinema release. Before this event, a three year delay was made by the Cinema Exhibitors' Association.\nPlot.\nThe film follows several naval ratings with the story switching between the characters. The naval ratings prepare for their coming months away at sea. The action takes place around the bars and clubs of the Union Street district of Plymouth. One major event that affects all the characters is the hospitalisation, and eventual death, of Daniel, played by Gary Oldman. This is after a violent assault by a nightclub bouncer.\nProduction.\nGregg got the idea for the film from his own experiences as a student at Plymouth Art College.\nIt was shot on location. It includes interior scenes in two Union Street pubs, \"The Phoenix\" and \"The Two Trees\".\nThe film was commissioned by Channel 4, before the channel had started broadcasting. It was shown in November 1982, close to Remembrance Sunday. This was in the first week of the new channel.\nIn June 1982, before being shown on TV, the film had been shown in a cinema, the \"Screen on the Hill\" in Hampstead.\nSoundtrack.\nBackground music is from \"Aragon\" by Brian Eno.\nReception.\nChannel 4's regulator, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), raised concerns about use of swearing in the script.\nThe film won the Golden Charybdis Award at the 1982 Taormina International Film Festival.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":29},{"uri":"Naval_rating","surface_form":"ratings","offset":40},{"uri":"Military_exercise","surface_form":"naval exercise","offset":102},{"uri":"Film","surface_form":"film","offset":172},{"uri":"Timothy_Spall","surface_form":"Timothy Spall","offset":191},{"uri":"Lisa_Maxwell_(actress)","surface_form":"Lisa Maxwell","offset":206},{"uri":"John_Altman_(actor)","surface_form":"John Altman","offset":223},{"uri":"Gary_Oldman","surface_form":"Gary Oldman","offset":243},{"uri":"Film4_Productions","surface_form":"Channel Four Films","offset":284},{"uri":"Channel_4","surface_form":"Channel 4","offset":338},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":404},{"uri":"Cinema_Exhibitors%27_Association","surface_form":"Cinema Exhibitors' Association","offset":543},{"uri":"Nonlinear_narrative","surface_form":"the story switching between the characters","offset":625},{"uri":"Union_Street%2C_Plymouth","surface_form":"Union Street","offset":788},{"uri":"Plymouth","surface_form":"Plymouth","offset":813},{"uri":"Gary_Oldman","surface_form":"Gary Oldman","offset":936},{"uri":"Bouncer_(doorman)","surface_form":"bouncer","offset":996},{"uri":"Plymouth_Art_College","surface_form":"Plymouth Art College","offset":1090},{"uri":"Channel_4","surface_form":"Channel 4","offset":1255},{"uri":"Remembrance_Sunday","surface_form":"Remembrance Sunday","offset":1351},{"uri":"Hampstead","surface_form":"Hampstead","offset":1523},{"uri":"Music_for_Films","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":1572},{"uri":"Brian_Eno","surface_form":"Brian Eno","offset":1583},{"uri":"Channel_4","surface_form":"Channel 4","offset":1605},{"uri":"Independent_Broadcasting_Authority","surface_form":"Independent Broadcasting Authority","offset":1632},{"uri":"Profanity","surface_form":"swearing","offset":1703},{"uri":"Taormina_Film_Fest","surface_form":"Taormina International Film Festival","offset":1779}]}
