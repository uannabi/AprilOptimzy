{"id":730229,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Chicago Seven (originally Chicago Eight, also Conspiracy Eight/Conspiracy Seven) were seven defendants charged by the federal government with conspiracy, causing a riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and countercultural protests that took place in Chicago, Illinois.\nThey were also responsible for the massive violent protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\nBobby Seale, the eighth man charged, had his trial end during the proceedings, lowering the number of defendants from eight to seven.\nThe trial resulted in five of the seven convicted for creating riots. All were acquitted of conspiracy. However, during the trial, Judge Julius Hoffman sentenced all of the defendants to lengthy sentences for Contempt of court. Later, the judge's contempt charges were reversed, and all of the convictions for causing riots were overturned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"riot","offset":181},{"uri":"Vietnam_War","surface_form":"Vietnam War","offset":221},{"uri":"Counterculture_of_the_1960s","surface_form":"countercultural","offset":237},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":281},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":290},{"uri":"1968_Democratic_National_Convention","surface_form":"1968 Democratic National Convention","offset":366},{"uri":"Bobby_Seale","surface_form":"Bobby Seale","offset":403},{"uri":"Julius_Hoffman","surface_form":"Julius Hoffman","offset":674},{"uri":"Contempt_of_court","surface_form":"Contempt of court","offset":746}]}
