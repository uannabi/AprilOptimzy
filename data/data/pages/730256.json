{"id":730256,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_New_Year","text":"Korean New Year () is the first day of the Korean lunar calendar. It is one of the most important traditional Korean holidays. The celebration usually lasts three days: the day before Korean New Year, Korean New Year itself, and the day after Korean New Year. During this time, many Koreans visit family, perform ancestral rites, wear \"hanbok\"(\uD55C\uBCF5), eat traditional food, and play folk games. Additionally, children often receive money from their elders after performing a formal bow.\nKorean New Year generally occurs in January or February on the second new moon after the winter solstice, unless there is a intercalary eleventh or twelfth month in the lead-up to the New Year. In such a case, the New Year falls on the third new moon after the solstice. Korean New Year typically falls on the same day as Chinese New Year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Korean_calendar","surface_form":"Korean lunar calendar","offset":43},{"uri":"Jesa","surface_form":"ancestral rites","offset":313},{"uri":"Hanbok","surface_form":"hanbok","offset":336},{"uri":"Bowing","surface_form":"bow","offset":479},{"uri":"New_moon","surface_form":"new moon","offset":554},{"uri":"Winter_solstice","surface_form":"winter solstice","offset":573},{"uri":"Intercalation_(timekeeping)","surface_form":"intercalary","offset":608},{"uri":"Chinese_New_Year","surface_form":"Chinese New Year","offset":806}]}
