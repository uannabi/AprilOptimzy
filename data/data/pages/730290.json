{"id":730290,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_expression","text":"e=\"preserve\">In computer science, a Boolean expression is an expression used in programming languages that produces either true or false when evaluated.\nBoolean expressions are often used by conditionals in computer programs to decide which code to run.\nMost Boolean expressions will contain at least one variable (), and often more () so that the expression can be useful for various values of X and Y.\nBoolean operators.\nBoolean operators may be represented by words such as\nOR, AND and \"NOT\".\nSome programming languages use symbols such as\n\"||\" (double pipe character) for OR, \"&&\" (double ampersand) for AND, and \"!\" for NOT.\nOther programming languages may use other symbols.\nOther Boolean operators may be available, too, for example XOR (exclusive OR).\nBoolean expressions can also be represented as Logic gates in electronic circuit diagrams.\nSee Truth tables for a summary of the effects of common Boolean operators.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":16},{"uri":"Expression_(programming)","surface_form":"expression","offset":61},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":80},{"uri":"Conditional_(computer_programming)","surface_form":"conditionals","offset":191},{"uri":"Logical_disjunction","surface_form":"OR","offset":477},{"uri":"Logical_conjunction","surface_form":"AND","offset":481},{"uri":"Negation","surface_form":"\"NOT\"","offset":489},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":501},{"uri":"Ampersand","surface_form":"ampersand","offset":593},{"uri":"Exclusive_disjunction","surface_form":"XOR","offset":740},{"uri":"Logic_gate","surface_form":"Logic gate","offset":807},{"uri":"Circuit_diagram","surface_form":"electronic circuit diagrams","offset":822},{"uri":"Truth_table","surface_form":"Truth table","offset":855}]}
