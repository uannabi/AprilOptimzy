{"id":730342,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_(TV_series)","text":"\"Angels\" is a British television seasonal drama series about student nurses. It was broadcast by the BBC between 1975 and 1983. It was described as the \"Z-Cars\" of nursing\".\nFrom 1979 the show changed to a seasonal twice-weekly soap opera format.\nBackground and creators.\nThe show's title came from the name of the hospital where the first series was set. This was St. Angela's in Battersea. In the 1980s this was changed to Heath Green Hospital in Birmingham. The series was devised by Paula Milne. Early producers included Morris Barry and Ron Craddock. The first episode was directed by Julia Smith. She became the show's producer in 1979. Her script editor on the later series was Tony Holland. Filming took place at St James' Hospital in Balham, London. This has since been demolished. Location filming for the fictional Heath Green Hospital took place at Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry. This has since been demolished and replaced by University Hospital Coventry.\nJulia Smith enlisted Tony Holland as the \"Angels\" script editor after the show became a twice-weekly soap. In the 1980s Smith and Holland created \"EastEnders\". Writers on its first series included Jill Hyem, Anne Valery and Adele Rose. Hyem and Valery later co-wrote \"Tenko\".\nActors.\nThe series included some young actors who would later become better known. These include Fiona Fullerton, \u00C9rin Geraghty, Lesley Dunlop, Julie Dawn Cole, Angela Bruce, Clare Clifford and Pauline Quirke. Additionally, Kathryn Apanowicz, Shirley Cheriton and Judith Jacob all later appeared in \"EastEnders\". Mamta Kaash played a key role in the hospital drama \"Casualty\".\nTheme music.\nThe guitar-driven theme tune, similar to American police dramas of the time, was called \"Motivation\". It was composed and performed by Alan Parker.\nCritical reception.\n\"Angels\", tackled issues such as contraception, alcoholism and promiscuity as part of the nurses' lives. \"Angels\" received criticism for its unglamorous depiction of the nursing profession. \"Angels\" tried to be realistic and authentic. Each actress was required to work on a real hospital ward to gain experience.\nBooks.\nSome TV tie-in novels were published to coincide with the series.\nDVD Release.\nOn 18 March 2013 Simply Media released the Series 1 (fifteen episodes) of \"Angels\" on DVD. Series 2 was released in September 2014.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_television","surface_form":"British television","offset":14},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":101},{"uri":"Z-Cars","surface_form":"Z-Cars","offset":153},{"uri":"Soap_opera","surface_form":"soap opera","offset":228},{"uri":"Battersea","surface_form":"Battersea","offset":381},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":449},{"uri":"Paula_Milne","surface_form":"Paula Milne","offset":487},{"uri":"Morris_Barry","surface_form":"Morris Barry","offset":525},{"uri":"Julia_Smith","surface_form":"Julia Smith","offset":590},{"uri":"Tony_Holland","surface_form":"Tony Holland","offset":685},{"uri":"University_Hospital_Coventry","surface_form":"University Hospital Coventry","offset":940},{"uri":"EastEnders","surface_form":"EastEnders","offset":1117},{"uri":"Jill_Hyem","surface_form":"Jill Hyem","offset":1167},{"uri":"Anne_Valery","surface_form":"Anne Valery","offset":1178},{"uri":"Adele_Rose","surface_form":"Adele Rose","offset":1194},{"uri":"Tenko_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Tenko","offset":1238},{"uri":"Fiona_Fullerton","surface_form":"Fiona Fullerton","offset":1343},{"uri":"%C3%89rin_Geraghty","surface_form":"\u00C9rin Geraghty","offset":1360},{"uri":"Lesley_Dunlop","surface_form":"Lesley Dunlop","offset":1375},{"uri":"Julie_Dawn_Cole","surface_form":"Julie Dawn Cole","offset":1390},{"uri":"Angela_Bruce","surface_form":"Angela Bruce","offset":1407},{"uri":"Clare_Clifford","surface_form":"Clare Clifford","offset":1421},{"uri":"Pauline_Quirke","surface_form":"Pauline Quirke","offset":1440},{"uri":"Kathryn_Apanowicz","surface_form":"Kathryn Apanowicz","offset":1470},{"uri":"Shirley_Cheriton","surface_form":"Shirley Cheriton","offset":1489},{"uri":"Judith_Jacob","surface_form":"Judith Jacob","offset":1510},{"uri":"EastEnders","surface_form":"EastEnders","offset":1546},{"uri":"Mamta_Kaash","surface_form":"Mamta Kaash","offset":1559},{"uri":"Casualty_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Casualty","offset":1612},{"uri":"Alan_Parker_(musician)","surface_form":"Alan Parker","offset":1771},{"uri":"Contraception","surface_form":"contraception","offset":1837},{"uri":"Alcoholism","surface_form":"alcoholism","offset":1852},{"uri":"Promiscuity","surface_form":"promiscuity","offset":1867},{"uri":"Tie-in","surface_form":"TV tie-in","offset":2130}]}
