{"id":730399,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism","text":"=\"preserve\">Second-wave feminism started in the 1960s in the United States. It lasted for roughly two decades. During First-wave feminism, women wanted to get the right to vote in elections and to be treated equally to men when it cames to owning and heriting property. Second-wave feminism focused more on issues of sexuality (sex education, contraception, abortion, family planning) and violence directed against women (domestic violence, rape, and Women's shelters). In many countries, there were also changes to the laws about divorce.\nIn the 1980s, there were disputes among different feminist groups (known as Feminist sex wars), over issues of sexuality and pornography. These disputes started the third-wave feminism in the early 1990s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":61},{"uri":"Decade","surface_form":"decade","offset":102},{"uri":"First-wave_feminism","surface_form":"First-wave feminism","offset":118},{"uri":"Vote","surface_form":"vote","offset":172},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":180},{"uri":"Sex_education","surface_form":"sex education","offset":328},{"uri":"Contraception","surface_form":"contraception","offset":343},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":358},{"uri":"Family_planning","surface_form":"family planning","offset":368},{"uri":"Domestic_violence","surface_form":"domestic violence","offset":422},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":441},{"uri":"Women%27s_shelter","surface_form":"Women's shelter","offset":451},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":531},{"uri":"Feminist_sex_wars","surface_form":"Feminist sex wars","offset":616},{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"pornography","offset":665},{"uri":"Third-wave_feminism","surface_form":"third-wave feminism","offset":705}]}
