{"id":730409,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi-Dirac_statistics","text":"=\"preserve\">Fermi-Dirac statistics is a branch of quantum statistics. It is named after Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac. It is used to describe the macroscopic state of a system which is made of many simliar particles (Fermions). One example is to describe the state of electrons in metals and semimetals, to describe electrical conductivity.\nThe Fermi distribution tells with what probability, a Fermi gas, at a given temperature and energy level, will have a particle in the given state.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quantum_statistics","surface_form":"quantum statistics","offset":50},{"uri":"Enrico_Fermi","surface_form":"Enrico Fermi","offset":88},{"uri":"Paul_Dirac","surface_form":"Paul Dirac","offset":105},{"uri":"Macroscopic","surface_form":"macroscopic","offset":144},{"uri":"Fermion","surface_form":"Fermion","offset":215},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":266},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":279},{"uri":"Semimetal","surface_form":"semimetal","offset":290},{"uri":"Electrical_conductivity","surface_form":"electrical conductivity","offset":314},{"uri":"Probability","surface_form":"probability","offset":378},{"uri":"Fermi_gas","surface_form":"Fermi gas","offset":393}]}
