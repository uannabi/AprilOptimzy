Her mother, Maria Magdalena Couret de la Blagni\u00E9re, was born in Haiti but she moved with her parents to Santo Domingo when the Haitian revolution. At that time, the eastern part of Hispaniola was a French colony. There she met B\u00E9noit Chass\u00E9riau and soon they got married and moved to Saman\u00E1.\nWhen the eastern part of the Hispaniola became again a colony of Spain, the family moved to Venezuela and Jamaica. Then, in 1821, the family went to live in Paris, France. Th\u00E9odore was three years old at that time.\nIn 1830, at the age of eleven, he started to study with Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and soon he became the favorite pupil of the great classicist.\nAfter Ingres left Paris in 1834 to become director of the French Academy in Rome, Chass\u00E9riau fell under the influence of Eug\u00E8ne Delacroix, a well-known romantic painter. From that moment on, Chass\u00E9riau tried to combine the two styles.\nChass\u00E9riau died when he was 37 years old in Paris, on October 8, 1856.\nOther websites.\nTh\u00E9odore Chass\u00E9riau exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId=%7B36C74126-EEF8-11D5-9414-00902786BF44%7D] Retrieved on 2007-10-03.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":78},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"romantic","offset":85},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":94},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portrait","offset":116},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":201},{"uri":"El_Lim%C3%B3n%2C_Saman%C3%A1","surface_form":"El Lim\u00F3n, Saman\u00E1","offset":248},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":295},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":380},{"uri":"Santo_Domingo","surface_form":"Santo Domingo","offset":420},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":497},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":637},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":673},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":700},{"uri":"Jamaica","surface_form":"Jamaica","offset":714},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":765},{"uri":"Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres","surface_form":"Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres","offset":879},{"uri":"Classicism","surface_form":"classicist","offset":961},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1049},{"uri":"Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix","surface_form":"Eug\u00E8ne Delacroix","offset":1094},{"uri":"Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art","surface_form":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","offset":1333}]}
