{"id":73104,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital","text":"e=\"preserve\">Venture capital is a type of private equity capital..\nTypically it is provided by outside investors to new businesses that promise to grow fast. Venture capital investments are usually high risk, but offer the potential for above-average returns.\nA venture capitalist (VC) is a person who makes such investments. A venture capital fund is a pooled investment vehicle (often a limited partnership) that primarily invests the financial capital of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans.\nVenture capital can also include managerial and technical expertise. Most venture capital comes from a group of rich investors, investment banks and other financial institutions that pool such investments or partnerships. This form of raising capital is popular among new companies, or ventures.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Private_equity","surface_form":"private equity","offset":42},{"uri":"Pooled_investment","surface_form":"pooled investment","offset":354},{"uri":"Limited_partnership","surface_form":"limited partnership","offset":389},{"uri":"Financial_capital","surface_form":"financial capital","offset":437},{"uri":"Capital_markets","surface_form":"capital markets","offset":531},{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"bank","offset":550},{"uri":"Loan","surface_form":"loan","offset":555}]}
