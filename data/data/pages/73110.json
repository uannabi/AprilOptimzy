{"id":73110,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector","text":"e=\"preserve\">In physics and mathematics, a pseudovector (or axial vector) is a quantity that transforms like a vector under a proper rotation, but gains an additional sign flip under an improper rotation (a transformation that can be expressed as an inversion followed by a proper rotation).\nPhysical examples.\nPhysical examples of pseudovectors include the magnetic field, torque, vorticity, and the angular momentum.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":16},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":28},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":111},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotation","offset":133},{"uri":"Improper_rotation","surface_form":"improper rotation","offset":186},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":358},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":374},{"uri":"Vorticity","surface_form":"vorticity","offset":382},{"uri":"Angular_momentum","surface_form":"angular momentum","offset":401}]}
