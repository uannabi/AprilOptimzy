{"id":73115,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke","text":"A spoke is one of several rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface.\nThe term originally meant the portions of a log which one had split lengthwise into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape. Eventually, the term spoke was applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rod","surface_form":"rods","offset":26},{"uri":"Wheel","surface_form":"wheel","offset":62},{"uri":"Hub","surface_form":"hub","offset":73},{"uri":"Axle","surface_form":"axle","offset":87},{"uri":"Log","surface_form":"log","offset":199},{"uri":"Wheelwright","surface_form":"wheelwright","offset":436}]}
