{"id":73129,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl","text":"\"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" (commonly known as SSBB or Brawl) is the third video game in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series. It was made by Sora and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console.\nCharacters.\nThere are 39 characters in \"Brawl\". 14 unlockables and 25 starters. Most of the characters from the second game in the series, which was called \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", return (although Mewtwo, Roy, Dr. Mario, Pichu, and Young Link were removed), and a few others are added, including two (Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog) that were in games that Nintendo did not own. The game is best known for the tripping mechanic (fighters will trip at random when running), introducing third party characters, and the smash ball.\nItems.\nLike the other \"Super Smash Bros.\" games, items appear in the middle of the game that characters can use. However, \"Brawl\" adds many more items, such as an \"Assist Trophy\" (where a character from a Nintendo game shows up to help you kill your) and a \"Smash Ball\" (when activated, it gives characters powers that make it really easy to kill opponents).\nStages.\n\"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" has many stages that players can battle on. Most of the stages are based on Nintendo series. One of these is Shadow Moses Island from \"Metal Gear Solid\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":73},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._(series)","surface_form":"\"Super Smash Bros.\" series","offset":91},{"uri":"Sora_Ltd.","surface_form":"Sora","offset":134},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":156},{"uri":"Wii","surface_form":"Wii","offset":173},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game console","offset":177},{"uri":"Mewtwo","surface_form":"Mewtwo","offset":397},{"uri":"Solid_Snake","surface_form":"Solid Snake","offset":501},{"uri":"Sonic_the_Hedgehog","surface_form":"Sonic the Hedgehog","offset":517},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros.","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.","offset":756},{"uri":"Metal_Gear_Solid","surface_form":"Metal Gear Solid","offset":1261}]}
