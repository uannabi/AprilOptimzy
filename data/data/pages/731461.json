{"id":731461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Alexandria","text":"e=\"preserve\">Philo Judaeus, also known as Philo of Alexandria, was a Jewish philosopher who lived from c. 20 BC to c. 50 AD. Philo wanted to prove that the Torah and Greek philosophy actually agreed with each other and he used allegory to do that. In 38 AD, Philo was one of many Egyptian Jews to meet with the Roman Emperor Caligula and he wrote a book about it.\nLife.\nEither Philo\u2019s father or his father\u2019s father was a Jew who became a Roman citizen based on a decision of the dictator Julius Caesar. Philo went to the Second Temple of Jerusalem at least once. Philo lived at the same time as Jesus did.\nEmbassy to Gaius.\nWhen Philo was living in Alexandria the Jews were treated badly by the Greeks. According to Philo\u2019s book Against Flaccus, Egypt\u2019s Roman ruler Aulis Avilius Flaccus persecuted the Jews because the Jews refused to worship Caligula as a god. Philo wrote his book Against Flaccus attacking him for doing that. Philo was one of many Jews who went to Rome to convince Caligula not to build a giant statue of himself as the god Jupiter and put it inside the Second Temple of Jerusalem because if Caligula did that the Jews would rebel against him. Philo wrote a book describing his mission to Caligula called Legatio ad Gaium (The Embassy to Gaius) because Gaius was Caligula\u2019s real name.\nJosephus\u2019s Version.\nAccording to the Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus, born Yosef ben Matityahu, in his book The Antiquities of the Jews, Philo was the brother of the Roman-appointed Jewish tax collector Alexander. In Josephus\u2019s version, the Jews refused to worship Caligula even though he commanded them to and Philo believed the Jews were right and that to worship Caligula would be a sin against God. A Roman named Apion came to Alexandria to convince the Jews that they were traitors to the Emperor and that Caligula would punish them but Philo convinced them that \u201C they should be of good courage, since Gaius\u2019s words indeed showed anger at them but in reality had already set God against himself\u201D. According to Josephus, the Jews of Alexandria chose Philo to represent them to Caligula and Philo said yes because he wanted to end the violence of the Greeks against the Jews.\nPhilo\u2019s Books.\nQuaestiones(Latin for the Inquiries) is a series of books by Philo explaining the Torah, verse by verse with the first four books being about Genesis and the last two about Exodus.\nAllegorical Commentary- a book by Philo about hidden meaning in the Book of Genesis.\nExposition of the Law, a classification of all the general topics in the Torah written for both Jews and Gentiles.\nOn the Life of Moses, a biography of Moses meant to show Moses as a philosopher.\nOn the Jews, a defence of the religion of Judaism.\nOn the Contemplative Life, a book by Philo arguing that [\nnot only does Greek philosophy not disagree with Judaism it was created by Judaism.\nAgainst Flaccus, a book by Philo attacking Flaccus for his persecution of Egyptian Jews.\nThe Embassy to Gaius, an eyewitness account of the mission to Caligula.\nEvery Good Man is Free, about moral philosophy.\nOn the Eternity of the World, about Metaphysics.\nPhilosophy.\nPhilo tries to prove that the teachings of Plato and of Moses actually work well together. He also thinks to be a good person, you have to control your emotions.\nThe Bible.\nPhilo believed that all truth was in the Hebrew Bible and that everything in the Torah came from God. Philo believed that all philosophy comes from the Torah and even Greek philosophers got their ideas from there. Philo also said that every person in the Hebrew Bible actually represented a human quality. Adam represents mind, Eve represents the senses and Noah represents (\u201Ctranquility\u201D).\nPhilo believed that God does not have a body or emotions. Philo says that no one really knows anything for sure except that God exists. Based on Plato, Philo argued that everything that exists has always existed as an idea in the mind of God.\nPolitics.\nBecause of his mission to Caligula people know that Philo was involved in politics but not what his political beliefs actually were. Philo did write that someone who told a tyrant what he really thought about him put not only his own life in danger but also the lives of his wife and children and that one should therefore not do that except if doing that were likely to work.\nInfluence.\nFor years, Philo was an influence on Christians like Eusebius and Jerome but was ignored by Jewish scholars. Then in 1575, an Italian Rabbi named Azariah die Rossi wrote a book in which he criticized Philo for reading the Torah in Greek instead of Hebrew, for believing that God created the Universe from matter that had always existed instead of believing that He created the Universe out of nothing, for relying too much on allegory in his approach to the Hebrew Bible and for not consulting\nJewish tradition. Rossi then tries to defend Philo and decides that he can\u2019t be sure if Philo\u2019s work is compatible with Judaism or not.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jewish","surface_form":"Jewish","offset":69},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":76},{"uri":"Torah","surface_form":"Torah","offset":156},{"uri":"Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":166},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":172},{"uri":"Allegory","surface_form":"allegory","offset":227},{"uri":"Egyptian","surface_form":"Egyptian","offset":280},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":289},{"uri":"Caligula","surface_form":"Caligula","offset":325},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":421},{"uri":"Roman","surface_form":"Roman","offset":438},{"uri":"Citizen","surface_form":"citizen","offset":444},{"uri":"Dictator","surface_form":"dictator","offset":479},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius
