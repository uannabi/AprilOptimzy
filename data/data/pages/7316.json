{"id":7316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting","text":"Melting is the process of changing something from a solid into a liquid (like ice into liquid water). It is the opposite of freezing. The temperature at which something begins to melt is called its melting point. When an object is heated, the object's particles begin to move faster and faster until the structured particles are freed. Now it is a liquid.\nIt is a solid that is turning into a liquid. It takes longer for something to melt if it is in cold water. Even ice and snow can melt outside during winter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":52},{"uri":"Liquid","surface_form":"liquid","offset":65},{"uri":"Ice","surface_form":"ice","offset":78},{"uri":"Freezing","surface_form":"freezing","offset":124},{"uri":"Melting_point","surface_form":"melting point","offset":198},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":476},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":505}]}
