{"id":731679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_of_Rock_za_Hrvatsku","text":"\"The Best of Rock za Hrvatsku\" (\"Rock for Croatia\") was a popular album of anti-war and patriotic songs by many different song writers and bands (a compilation album). It was released in 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence. Some of the artists whose songs were in this album were popular across Yugoslavia before it broke up, like Psihomodo pop, Jura Stubli\u0107, Parni valjak, Boa, and Aerodrom's Jura Pa\u0111en. They took a pro-Croatian stance as the Yugoslav Wars began, while other popular song writers and bands like Azra did not have their songs in the album because they broke up.\nThe album also made some new people popular, like the dance group ET, rock band Thompson and others. They would become the first specifically Croatian bands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":42},{"uri":"1992","surface_form":"1992","offset":187},{"uri":"Croatian_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"Croatian War of Independence","offset":204},{"uri":"Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":305},{"uri":"Yugoslav_Wars","surface_form":"Yugoslav Wars","offset":455},{"uri":"Azra","surface_form":"Azra","offset":524},{"uri":"Thompson_(band)","surface_form":"Thompson","offset":670}]}
