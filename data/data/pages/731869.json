{"id":731869,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon","text":"The Maine Coon is the biggest cat breed used as a pet. It has a unique look and good hunting skills. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically native to the state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.\nNobody knows for sure how the Maine Coon got to the United States, so there are several different ideas. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but it almost became extinct because of long-haired breeds from overseas in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since been brought back and is now one of the most popular cat breeds in the USA.\nThe Maine Coon is a large and friendly cat, which is how it got its nickname, \"the gentle giant.\" It is characterized by a big ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an uneven two layered coat, and a long, bushy tail. The breed's colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree. People often say the Maine Coon has \"dog-like\" characteristics. Professionals notice certain health problems recurring in the breed, including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize the frequency of these problems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Breeds_of_cats","surface_form":"cat breed","offset":30},{"uri":"Natural_breed","surface_form":"natural breed","offset":125},{"uri":"Indigenous_(ecology)","surface_form":"native","offset":171},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":194},{"uri":"List_of_U.S._state_pets","surface_form":"state cat","offset":226},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":289},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":424},{"uri":"Dog-like_cat","surface_form":"dog-like","offset":976},{"uri":"Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy","surface_form":"feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","offset":1082},{"uri":"Hip_dysplasia_(canine)","surface_form":"hip dysplasia","offset":1121}]}
