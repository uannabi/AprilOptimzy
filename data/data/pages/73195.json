Its biggest rivers are the Emme and the Ilfis. The biggest localities are Burgdorf, Langnau and Huttwil.\nThe landscape is mostly made of meadows. There are some forests too. Most of the people live from raising cattle (mostly cows), or from things closely related to cattle-raising. Emmental cheese has its name from this region. Langnau is known for Ceramics. Pottery from the region is also well-known.\nThere is also some industry. The Emmental had one of the first fully-electric railway lines in Switzerland.\nJeremias Gotthelf was a famous writer who spent most of his life in the Emmental.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":53},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"Canton","offset":81},{"uri":"Bern_(canton)","surface_form":"Berne","offset":91},{"uri":"Emme","surface_form":"Emme","offset":125},{"uri":"Ilfis","surface_form":"Ilfis","offset":138},{"uri":"Locality","surface_form":"localities","offset":157},{"uri":"Burgdorf%2C_Switzerland","surface_form":"Burgdorf","offset":172},{"uri":"Langnau_im_Emmental","surface_form":"Langnau","offset":182},{"uri":"Huttwil","surface_form":"Huttwil","offset":194},{"uri":"Meadow","surface_form":"meadow","offset":235},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forest","offset":259},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cattle","offset":309},{"uri":"Cow","surface_form":"cow","offset":324},{"uri":"Emmental_cheese","surface_form":"Emmental cheese","offset":381},{"uri":"Ceramics","surface_form":"Ceramics","offset":449},{"uri":"Pottery","surface_form":"Pottery","offset":459},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":581},{"uri":"Jeremias_Gotthelf","surface_form":"Jeremias Gotthelf","offset":611}]}
