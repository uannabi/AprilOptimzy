This is the same list that was used in the 2000 season. There were no names retired from the northeast Pacific list. Therefore, the same list was reused in the 2012 season.\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 2006 are shown below, however only the name Ioke was used.\nRetirement.\nThe name \"Ioke\" was retired from the north-central Pacific list by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2007 and replaced with \"Iopa\". During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name \"Daniel\", citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat of damage. However, the request was denied, as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list.\nSeason effects.\nThis is a table of all the storms that formed in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2006 USD.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["hurricane season","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small","Hurricane Small"],"annotations":[{"uri":"2000_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2000 Pacific hurricane season","offset":184},{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":234},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":242},{"uri":"June_1","surface_form":"June 1","offset":322},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":329},{"uri":"International_Date_Line","surface_form":"International Date Line","offset":379},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":447},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":460},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific basin","offset":573},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":721},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":876},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":1480},{"uri":"Johnson_Atoll","surface_form":"Johnson Atoll","offset":1768},{"uri":"Wake_Island","surface_form":"Wake Island","offset":1786},{"uri":"August_20","surface_form":"august 20","offset":1812},{"uri":"September_6","surface_form":"September 6","offset":1904},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":2019},{"uri":"Baja_California_Peninsula","surface_form":"Baja California","offset":2414},{"uri":"September_1","surface_form":"September 1","offset":2455},{"uri":"September_4","surface_form":"September 4","offset":2491},{"uri":"October_13","surface_form":"October 13","offset":3113},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":3190},{"uri":"2000_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2000 season","offset":3726},{"uri":"2012_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2012 season","offset":3843},{"uri":"Central_Pacific_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"Central Pacific Hurricane Center","offset":3884},{"uri":"140th_meridian_west","surface_form":"140 degrees west","offset":3973},{"uri":"International_Date_Line","surface_form":"International Date Line","offset":3998},{"uri":"Hurricane_Ioke","surface_form":"Ioke","offset":4170},{"uri":"List_of_retired_Pacific_hurricane_names","surface_form":"retired","offset":4217},{"uri":"World_Meteorological_Organization","surface_form":"World Meteorological Organization","offset":4268}]}
