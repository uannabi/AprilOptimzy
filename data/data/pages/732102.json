{"id":732102,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holby_City","text":"\"Holby City\" (styled as \"HOLBY CI+Y\") is a British medical drama television series shown weekly on BBC One. The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama \"Casualty\". It was first shown on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as \"Casualty\" in the fictional city of Holby. Some episodes have characters and plots shared with \"Casualty\". There have been episodes broadcast as \"Casualty@Holby City\". Some episodes have characters and plots shared with the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off \"HolbyBlue\".\n\"Holby City\" is shown once a week, all year round. Each series now contains 52 episodes.\nThe show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital.\nAs of January 2020, twenty-one series of \"Holby City\" have been shown. It is made at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire. It has featured episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, \"Holby City\" moved to high definition broadcasting.\nThe series uses a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy. Surgeons check the scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures. They spend time on hospital wards for research.\n\"Holby City\" has been nominated for over 100 television awards. It has won ten awards. The 2008 British Academy Television Award for Best Continuing Drama, one Black Entertainment Film Fashion Television and Arts (BEFFTA) award, two Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards, two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four Screen Nation awards.\nThe first series averaged 9.27\u00A0million viewers. The eleventh series averaged 5.44\u00A0million viewers. Later series have had over 4 million viewers per week.\nProduction.\nThe first series had eleven main characters. All have since left the show. New main characters have been written in and out of the series. There are fifteen main characters. Well known actors regularly appear. Cast members have included Patsy Kensit, Jane Asher, Robert Powell, Ade Edmondson, John Michie, Al Hunter Ashton, Alex Walkinshaw and Jemma Redgrave.\nIn September 2016 the BBC said the show would be put up for tender.\nThe tender document said the contract would be open to independent producers and BBC Studios. It would be for three series of at least 50 episodes each. It would be delivered from December 2017 with no break in transmission. It would be produced at BBC Elstree Centre.\nBBC Studios was the winning bidder and will continue to produce the show to 2020.\nDevelopment.\n\"Holby City\" was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama \"Casualty\". It is set in the fictional Holby City Hospital.\nYoung wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in \"Casualty\" once they were taken to the hospital's surgical wards.\nThe stories on \"Casualty\" are limited to the \"accident of the week\". \"Holby City\" has stories about long-term care, rather than immediate life and death decisions.\nThe series was commissioned by BBC One Controller Peter Salmon. It was first shown on BBC One on 12 January 1999.\nSince its beginning, it has expanded to cover other wards. These include a gynaecology ward, an acute assessment unit and a maternity ward.\nYoung explained that new wards are necessary to allow the crew to rotate sets.\nEpisodes of \"Holby City\" cost around \u00A3370,000 to produce. This is more than the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\" which costs \u00A3130,000 per episode. \"Casualty\" costs \u00A3450,000 per episode. As \"Holby City\" is a high-volume, year-round production, it has relatively low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years. Sets can be re-used. This is not the case for shorter series or one-off dramas.\nFormer \"Casualty\" producer Johnathan Young was an executive producer of \"Holby\" first series.\nMal Young was executive producer of \"Holby City\" until 2004.\nKathleen Hutchison worked with Mal Young as co-executive producer from 2003 to 2004. She left the series to become executive producer of \"EastEnders\".\nIn March 2011, Johnathan Young returned to the BBC as executive producer of both \"Casualty\" and \"Holby City\".\nWriting.\n\"Holby City\" storylines are planned eight months in advance. The series has a number of scriptwriters. They are found and scheduled by script development editor Simon Harper.\nHarper finds some writers through the BBC Writers Academy. This is a course which gives its graduates the chance to work on prime time television. McHale teaches at the academy, and graduate Abi Bown went on to become a regular writer for \"Holby City\".\nHarper also recruits writers through the BBC's Continuing Drama Shadow Scheme.\nMcHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer.\nHis 2006 promotion to executive producer was part Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke's plan to \"put writers back at the heart of the process\". Yorke said McHale's promotion was \"fantastic. It means that for the first time you've got a writer running one of our big powerhouse BBC1 shows.\"\nAfter McHale resigned the lead writer was Justin Young. He wants a more writer-led process from series 13 onwards. Writers will create more of the story of their episodes than before.\nMedical accuracy.\nThe serial employs a team of researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon. Another advisor, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in \"Holby City\" as a scrub nurse.\nThe programme uses different types os surgeons to check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is important as viewers might copy what they see in the show, such as CPR.\nActor Amanda Mealing said: \"We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones.\"\nCast members are taught how to give injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some watch procedures in hospitals.\nOriginal cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer. Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.\nFilming and on-screen output.\n\"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\" are both set in Holby City Hospital. This is in the fictional county of Wyvern in the southwest of England close to the Welsh border.\nBristol is used for city exteriors. Interior filming of \"Holby City\" is at BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.\nThe \"Casualty\" set in Bristol was not large enough for the surgical ward and operating theatre needed for \"Holby City\". So some scenes in the first episode had to be shot twice, first on the \"Casualty\" set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations.\nIn October 2007, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the Elstree site would be sold, and \"Holby City\" moved to share a set with \"Casualty\", possibly in Cardiff.\nIn March 2009, the BBC said that \"Casualty\" would move to a new set in Cardiff. In April 2009, \"The Guardian\" said that the BBC would retain Elstree Studios for at least another four years.\nSome episodes have been shot on location abroad. In 2004, the romance between nurse Jess Griffin (Verona Joseph) and anaesthetist Zubin Khan (Art Malik) had an episode set in Paris.\nIn 2005, registrar Diane Lloyd (Patricia Potter) followed consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) to Ghana. This was part of the BBC's \"Africa lives\" series, a week of programmes bringing African culture to UK audiences.\nIn 2006, an episode in Switzerland had consultant Elliot Hope's (Paul Bradley) wife Gina (Gillian Bevan) committing assisted suicide after her motor neurone disease worsened.\nA 2007 episode in Dubai focused on \"Holby\" registrar Joseph Byrne (Luke Roberts) meeting new nurse Faye Morton (Patsy Kensit).\nIn 2008, Joseph and consultant Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow) travelled to Cape Town.\nIn November 2008, series producer Diana Kyle said that they would not be filming abroad again for the \"foreseeable future\".\nOn 10 December 2012, it was announced that the show had filmed one episode in Stockholm. This focussed on Jac tracking down hospital CEO Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry).\n\"Holby City\" is shot using the single-camera setup.\nFilming occurs from 8\u00A0am until 6\u00A0pm daily, 50 weeks a year.\nFrom July 2007 onwards, the show took on the filmising technique, giving the impression of having been shot on film.\nOn 28 May 2010, the BBC announced that \"Holby City\" would move to HD by the end of the year.\nThe series moved to HD broadcasting, with a BBC HD simulcast, from the start of series 13 in October 2010.\nMusic.\nFrom the eleventh series a musical montage segment was included in each episode. This was introduced by McHale to modernise the show. This use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\". McHale stated he was unaware of this until after \"Holby City\" had used the technique.\nMusic is selected by each episode's scriptwriter. Sometimes the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors have had some input: Hugh Quarshie selected the music he believed his character Ric Griffin would listen to in theatre. Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle said: \"they are an excellent way of telling stories visually\".\nBroadcast.\n\"Holby City\" was first shown on 12 January 1999 on BBC One.\nThe show's first series ran for nine episodes.\nIn June 2000, then Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke pledged extra funding for BBC One, some of which was used for extra episodes of \"Holby City\".\nThe second series ran for 16 episodes.\nThe third series ran for 30 episodes.\nEpisodes were shown weekly from the fourth series onwards.\nSeries four to nine ran for 52 episodes. Series ten ran for 53 episodes, including the stand-alone finale episode \"Mad World\", set outside the hospital. Series eleven ran for 52 episodes. Series twelve had 55 episodes.\nAll series from then on had 52 episodes. The series reached its 500th episode on 13 April 2010.\nIn the first series episodes were 50 minutes long. From the second series episodes have been one hour.\nThe first series was shown on Tuesday nights at 8.10\u00A0pm. The second series moved to Thursdays. Halfway through the third series in 2001, Holby moved back to Tuesday night at 8.05\u00A0pm. It then moved into the 8pm timeslot, where it has remained. The show is occasionally shown on a different day.\nIn 2007, the show moved to Thursday nights to allow HolbyBlue to be shown in the 8pm Tuesday timeslot. BBC One Scotland has often shown the series at a later time.\nIn February 2019, it was announced that repeats of \"Holby City\" would begin on the channel Drama. This would begin with the first series.\nIn Finland it is shown on the channel Yle TV2 and is called \"Holby Cityn sairaala\".\nSeries twenty-two started on 7 January 2020.\nCharacters.\n\"Holby City\" follows the professional and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at Holby General. It has an ensemble cast of main and recurring characters. The show has 10 to 20 main characters.\nThe original cast of 11 characters featured in the show's first episode was consultants Anton Meyer (George Irving) and Muriel McKendrick (Phyllis Logan), registrars Nick Jordan (Michael French) and Kirstie Collins (Dawn McDaniel), senior house officer Victoria Merrick (Lisa Faulkner), ward sister Karen Newburn (Sarah Preston), theatre sister Ellie Sharpe (Julie Saunders), senior staff nurse Ray Sykes (Ian Curtis), staff nurses Julie Bradford (Nicola Stephenson) and Jasmine Hopkins (Angela Griffin), and ward clerk Paul Ripley (Luke Mably).\nCasting.\nFor the first series, Young selected actors who were already established and had a soap opera background. Young had previously worked on the soap operas \"Brookside\" and \"Family Affairs\"\nFrench had starred in the BBC's \"EastEnders\", while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in \"Brookside\". Griffin had also appeared in ITV's \"Coronation Street\". Hiring of established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former \"Brookside\" actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, \"Star Wars\" actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and \"Family Affairs\" star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later, roles were given to comedian Adrian Edmondson, film actress Patsy Kensit, and \"Jesus of Nazareth\" star Powell.\nThere is a casting department at Elstree Studios which casts actors for \"Holby City\" as well as \"Casualty\", \"EastEnders\" and \"Doctors\". The programme also has two casting directors who bring in actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in minor \"Holby City\" roles.\nCurrent characters include acting chief executive officer and consultant neurosurgeon Max McGerry (Jo Martin), consultant general surgeon and medical director Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), consultant cardiothoracic surgeons lead Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) and Kian Madani (Ramin Karimloo), consultant general surgeons Ben Sherwood (Charlie Condou), Ange Godard (Dawn Steele), Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett), and Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell), speciality registrars Dominic Copeland (David Ames), Xavier Duval (Marcus Griffiths), and Chloe Godard (Amy Lennox), foundation training doctors Nicky McKendrick (Belinda Owusu) and Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman), director of nursing Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw), and senior staff nurses Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) and Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg).\nGuest stars.\n\"Holby City\" has had a number of famous guest stars.\nWalk-on roles.\nIn 2003, the BBC reached an agreement with the actors' union Equity to cease offering walk-on drama series roles to members of the public as prizes. When an untrained person won such a role in \"Holby City\" in a competition, Equity complained to the broadcaster that such prizes were \"demeaning\" to actors, depriving them of paid employment. The competition winner was allowed to visit the \"Holby City\" set, but did not appear on-screen as a result of the policy change.\n\"Casualty@Holby City\".\nThe BBC has shown occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled \"Casualty@Holby City\". It has a number of characters from each of the two casts.\nBefore \"Casualty@Holby City\", the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before. For example developing a romance between \"Holby City\" Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and \"Casualty\" Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton).\nThe first full crossover was made by \"Casualty\" executive producer Mervyn Watson, and \"Holby City\" McHale. Work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release cast members to appear in the special.\nA second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season. This aimed to raise public awareness of organ donation and to decide to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of \"Casualty@Holby City\" was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation.\nThe third \"Casualty@Holby City\" crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A&E demonstration at an inner-city school.\nAnother crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.\nIn February 2010, another crossover occurred when \"Casualty\" Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) was operated on by \"Holby City\" Elliot Hope after suffering a heart attack. The storyline was shown as \"Casualty\" and \"Holby City\" episodes, rather than under the \"Casualty@Holby City\" title.\n\"Casualty\" series producer Oliver Kent commented that, while it is \"fantastic\" to be able to produce crossover episodes, they are logistically difficult, and it is unlikely that another \"Casualty@Holby City\" episode will be produced in the \"foreseeable future\".\nIn September 2010, \"Holby City\" nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) appeared in \"Casualty\", and Kent hopes that characters from the two shows will begin to crossover two or three times a year.\nHolbyBlue.\nOn 27 April 2006, the BBC announced \"Holby Blue\", a police procedural spin-off from \"Holby City\". It was created by Tony Jordan.\n\"Holby City\" was moved to Thursdays for the duration of \"HolbyBlue\" first series, with the spin-off broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8\u00A0pm.\nIn 2008, a two-part crossover episode with \"Holby City\" was developed for the beginning of the show's second series. The episodes were written by McHale and Jordan. \"Holby City\" registrar Jac Naylor accused of murder.\nYorke compared the crossover to the American \"CSI\" franchise, in that: \"You really believe it's a world.\"\nThe second series attracted 5.6\u00A0million viewers to its opening episode. By the end of May 2008 viewer numbers had fallen to 2.5\u00A0million.\nIn August 2008, the BBC announced that, due to lower ratings, \"Holby Blue\" would not be recommissioned for a third series.\nOther appearances.\nIn June 2002, cast members from \"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\" competed against the \"EastEnders\" cast for the first \"Sport Relief\" fundraiser, dubbed \"Sport in the Square\". The teams competed in events such as taxi pulling, melon tossing and a beer keg relay.\nThe competition was shown on BBC One, and the event raised \u00A310\u00A0million.\nIn October 2003, BBC One aired a \"Kenyon Confronts\" documentary by \"Panorama\" reporter Paul Kenyon, investigating hospitals run by the Private Finance Initiative. He discovered many problems within the hospitals, which were dramatised by the \"Holby City\" cast in specially written scenes.\nIn March 2004, the documentary \"Making It at Holby\" was made as part of a BBC initiative to develop new acting talent. The documentary followed the casting process of \"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\", from the audition stages to the filming of the selected actors' first scenes.\nIn November 2006, the \"Children in Need\" charity telethon included a segment featuring the \"Holby City\" cast performing a comical version of \"Hung Up\" by Madonna.\nIn November 2007 \"Children in Need\" appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Sharon D Clarke, backed by Nadine Lewington, Rakie Ayola and Phoebe Thomas performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, \"Respect\".\nOn 28 June 2008, \"Holby City\" stars competed against their \"Casualty\" counterparts in a special charity edition of BBC Two game-show \"The Weakest Link\".\nIn February 2010, \"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\" cast members performed a dance rendition of \"Jai Ho\" for \"Let's Dance for Sport Relief\".\nCritical response.\n\"Holby City\" has been compared to other medical dramas, often unfavourable.\nIn November 2002, John Whiston, then head of drama at Granada Television, accused the BBC of producing inferior \"parodies\" of ITV drama. He commented \"With \"Holby City\" cloned out of \"Casualty\", the BBC has even ended up copying itself.\"\nPaul Hoggart of \"The Times\" says that the differences between the two shows are \"mild\", calling \"Holby City\": \"Casualty\" cute little sister\".\nKevin Lygo, director of television at Channel 4, referred to \"Holby City\" as \"sudsy drama\", deeming it, \"Casualty\" and \"HolbyBlue\" \"all decent programmes, but strikingly similar in many aspects of their tone and construction.\"\n\"Holby City\" has been unfavourably compared with the American medical drama \"ER\". Television producer Paul Abbott has commented that although he watches \"ER\", he does not watch \"Holby City\" as: \"it looks like you've crammed one hour's drama into 26 episodes.\"\nIn October 2009, former \"Holby City\" writer Peter Jukes wrote a critical piece for \"Prospect\" magazine, contrasting the show negatively with the standard of American television dramas. Jukes wrote that \"Holby City\" has become a soap opera, rather than a drama, and deemed the episodes he worked on \"the most dispiriting experiences in [his] 25 years as a dramatist.\"\nIn August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being \"humdrum\" and \"formulaic\", saying of \"Holby City\" and the police procedural \"Mersey Beat\": \"One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different.\" Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were \"highly selective\" as well as \"hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like \"Holby City\" \u2013 week in, week out\". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told \"The Guardian\": \"Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons.\"\nAt the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that \"Holby City\" be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: \"This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold.\"\nIn 2003, former BBC host Sir Ludovic Kennedy complained that ethnic minorities were over-represented on television, prompting a BBC spokeswoman to explain that \"Holby City\" has more ethnic characters as it is set in an area where minorities account for up to 30% of the population. According to the 2001 census, the population of Bristol \u2013 which the city of Holby is loosely based upon \u2013 is 88% white and 12% ethnic minorities.\nIn October 2003, \"Holby City\" was praised by campaigners for the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), when an episode which coincided with \"Learn To Sign Week\" used deaf actors, and featured characters communicating through British Sign Language. RNID chief executive John Low stated: \"Too often individuals have to rely on family members or friends to communicate complicated personal information to professionals. This is the reason the RNID is calling on the government to channel funding into the training of British Sign Language interpreters who could then be available to NHS staff treating deaf patients.\" Stokes commented: \"The writer had a great story he wanted to tell \u2013 for us, that's what matters first and foremost.\"\nIn June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of \"Holby City\",\nA 2008 a Channel 4 report into ethnic diversity on television, cited \"Holby City\" as a positive example of \"diverse British programm[ing]\".\nIn January 2010, Janet Street-Porter in \"The Independent\", said \"Holby City\" had \"come to the end of Tom Sutcliffe of \"The Independent\" reviewed an episode, finding it \"astonishing\" that any patients leave Holby General alive, as the staff are \"so busy looking stricken or lovelorn at each other\".\nMisuse of alcohol has been criticised.\nIn December 2003, \"The Times\" Libby Purves wrote a critical opinion piece, observing that \"Holby City\" medical staff are often depicted getting drunk in clubs, but afterwards are able to function properly at work, and that as a result, alcohol \"is made to look innocent\".\nIn October 2004, Canon Kenyon Wright, chair of Alcohol Focus Scotland, criticised an episode of \"Holby City\" which saw doctors downing tequila slammers, stating that it glamorised irresponsible drinking.\nIn October 2007, drinks' industry body the Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about a scene in \"Holby City\" which depicted two medics drinking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show the negative consequences of this action, the series was presenting a \"highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking\". Ofcom received a total of eight complaints about the incident.\n\"Holby City\" has also been accused of medical inaccuracies.\nIn January 2004, the British Medical Association denounced an episode which showed organ donation being done despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: \"This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme.\"\nIn 2005, the British Medical Association said that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this \"a terrible distortion of the truth.\"\nIn 2009, \"The Times\", Vivienne Parry highlighted the fact that in reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial event. Of those, only a third live to leave hospital.\nIn April 2010, at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth, \"Holby City\" was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling a compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: \"In A&E it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received. Unfortunately, unlike in \"Holby City\", I am a mere mortal and cannot perform miracles. But many relatives believe because of that, you can. And the injury lawyers assure them that if you don't they will get recompense for it.\"\nImpact.\nIn October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency consultant at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised the number of patients visiting the department for minor problems without first seeing their GP. Ryan attributed this to patients watching \"Holby City\" and falsely seeing hospitals as glamorous.\nIn September 2008, a three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting, claimed that watching \"Holby City\" and similar medical dramas such as \"Casualty\" and \"ER\" had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those who watched more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful about their health.\nIn 2008, Conservative Party strategists identified four archetypes based on TV programmes to help the party target swing voters. Alongside \"Top Gear\" man\", \"Apprentice\" generation\" and \"Grand Designs\" couple\", they identified \"Holby City\" worker\", a middle-ranking health service worker. In 2009, they identified \"\"Holby City\" woman\" as a key voter demographic who may help the party win the 2010 General Election. The \"Holby City\" woman\" is a female voter in her 30s or 40s, employed in a clinical or clerical position or some other public sector job. She is a swing voter in General Elections, The \"Holby City\" woman\" archetype is modelled on the character of Faye Morton.\nIn January 2009, Jill Berry, president of the Girls' Schools Association and head teacher at the Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedford, cited medical dramas such as \"Holby City\" as an inspiring force in increasing numbers of female students deciding to pursue careers in medicine. Berry explained: \"The girls see that as an exciting and dynamic way of life. They see it as making a difference to people's lives. It gives them a sense sometimes of the pressures, responsibility and adrenaline. Such TV programmes can be good, as long as they give a realistic impression.\" Similarly, consultant surgeon Andrew Raftery uses clips from \"Holby City\" as part of the University of Sheffield Outreach and Access to Medicine Scheme, to inspire pupils from under-represented social and educational backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine.\nAwards and nominations.\n\"Holby City\" has been nominated for over 100 awards.
