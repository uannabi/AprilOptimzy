{"id":73211,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Pacific_hurricane_season","text":"The 1987 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 1987 in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1987 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1987. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nDespite there being twenty cyclones, there were very few notable storms this year. Only three storms came anywhere near to threatening land. Hurricane Eugene was the first Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since at least the 1949 season. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain in the Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the dateline and became a typhoon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":53},{"uri":"1987","surface_form":"1987","offset":61},{"uri":"June_1","surface_form":"June 1","offset":94},{"uri":"1987","surface_form":"1987","offset":102},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":148},{"uri":"1987","surface_form":"1987","offset":161},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":279},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"Pacific hurricane","offset":466},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"Continent","offset":679},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":691}]}
