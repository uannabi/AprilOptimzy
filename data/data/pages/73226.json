{"id":73226,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Fermat number is a special positive number. Fermat numbers are named after Pierre de Fermat. The formula that generates them is\nAs of 2007, only the first 12 Fermat numbers have been completely factored. (written as a product of prime numbers) These factorizations can be found at [http://www.prothsearch.com/fermat.html Prime Factors of Fermat Numbers].\nIf 2\"n\" + 1 is prime, and \"n\" > 0, it can be shown that \"n\" must be a power of two. Every prime of the form 2\"n\" + 1 is a Fermat number, and such primes are called Fermat primes. The only known Fermat primes are \"F\"0...,\"F\"4.\nWhat they are used for.\nToday, Fermat numbers can be used to generate random numbers, between 0 and some value N, which is a power of 2.\nFermat's conjecture.\nFermat, when he was studying these numbers, conjectured that all Fermat numbers were prime. This was proven to be wrong by Leonhard Euler, who factorised formula_1 in 1732.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Positive_number","surface_form":"positive","offset":42},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":51},{"uri":"Pierre_de_Fermat","surface_form":"Pierre de Fermat","offset":90},{"uri":"Factorization","surface_form":"factored","offset":209},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime","offset":385},{"uri":"Random","surface_form":"random","offset":666},{"uri":"Conjecture","surface_form":"conjecture","offset":798},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonhard Euler","offset":877}]}
