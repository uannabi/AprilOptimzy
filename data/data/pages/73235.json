{"id":73235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation","text":"=\"preserve\">An improper rotation can be understood as an inversion followed by a proper rotation.\nEquivalently it is the combination of a rotation and an inversion in a point on the axis. Therefore it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion.\nA simple example of an improper rotation in 3D (but not in 2D) is a coordinate inversion: x goes to \u2212x, y to \u2212y and z to \u2212z. Under this transformation, a and b go to \u2212a and \u2212b (by the definition of a vector), but p clearly does not change. (It follows that any improper rotation multiplies p by \u22121 compared to the rotation's effect on a true vector.)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Inversion","surface_form":"inversion","offset":57},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotation","offset":88},{"uri":"Inversion_in_a_point","surface_form":"inversion in a point","offset":154},{"uri":"Axis_(mathematics)","surface_form":"axis","offset":182},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":297},{"uri":"Vector","surface_form":"vector","offset":453}]}
