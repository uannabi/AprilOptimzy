He is the oldest known man ever from Ehime Prefecture where he was born.\nWatanabe married at age 22 and had two sons (of whom one died in the Pacific War) and six daughters with his wife, who died at age 42. He worked in the agriculture until age 95 and was at age 100 still able to mow the grass and take care of himself.\nOn 17 January 2010, upon the death of Kiyotoshi Inoue who was just two days older, Watanabe became the second oldest known living man in Japan behind Jiroemon Kimura (who one day later was just 13 weeks shy of his 113th birthday) and the third oldest known living man in the world as well as the youngest of only three known living men born before 1900, behind Kimura and Americanman Walter Breuning (who was 30 weeks older than Kimura).\nWatanabe died of pneumonia at a hospital in his hometown Kumak\u014Dgen, Ehime Prefecture at age 110 years, 8 weeks on 6 February 2010, just nine days before Tanekichi Onishi's 110th birthday, and was succeeded as Japan's second-oldest living man by Onishi.
