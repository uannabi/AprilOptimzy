{"id":73271,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9an_T._O%27Kelly","text":"Se\u00E1n Thomas O'Kelly (; 25 August 1882 \u2013 23 November 1966) was the second President of Ireland. He served two terms from 1945 to 1959. He was a member of D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann from 1918 until his election as President. During this time he had been Minister for Local Government (1932\u20131939) and Minister for Finance (1939\u20131945). \u00D3 Ceallaigh served as Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1932 until 1937 and was the first T\u00E1naiste of \u00C9ire from 1937 until 1945.\nEarly life.\n\u00D3 Ceallaigh was born in Dublin on Capel Street in the north inner-city Dublin. He joined the National Library of Ireland in 1898 as a junior assistant. The same year, he joined the Gaelic League, becoming a member of the governing body in 1910 and General Secretary in 1915.\nSinn F\u00E9in.\nIn 1905 \u00D3 Ceallaigh joined Sinn F\u00E9in. Sinn F\u00E9in then wanted a dual-monarchy. He was an honorary secretary of the party from 1908 until 1925. In 1906 he was elected to Dublin Corporation, which was Dublin's city council. He retained the seat until 1924.\nP\u00E1draig Pearse made \u00D3 Ceallaigh his helper when Pearse was getting ready for the Easter Rising.\nAfter the Easter Rising in 1916, \u00D3 Ceallaigh was put in jail, released, and put in jail again. He escaped from jail in Fairfield in the UK, and came back to Ireland.\nMP in the 1918 general election.\nO'Kelly was elected Sinn F\u00E9in MP for College Green in the 1918 British general election. Along with other Sinn F\u00E9in MPs he refused to take his seat in the British House of Commons. Instead they set up an Irish parliament, called D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann, in Dublin. \u00D3 Ceallaigh wasCeann Comhairle(Chairman) of the First D\u00E1il. He was the Irish Republic's envoy to the post-World War One peace treaty negotiations at Versailles, but the other countries refused to allow him to speak, because they did not recognise the Irish Republic\nClose to de Valera.\n\u00D3 Ceallaigh was a close friend of \u00C9amon de Valera, and both he and de Valera opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921.\nWhen de Valera resigned as President of the Irish Republic on 6 January 1922, \u00D3 Ceallaigh returned from Paristo try to persuade de Valera to return to the presidency. A de Valera was furious and ordered \u00D3 Ceallaigh to return to Paris.\nDuring the Irish Civil War, O'Kelly was in jail until December 1923. Afterwards he spent the next two years as a Sinn F\u00E9in envoy to the United States.\nA founder of Fianna F\u00E1il.\nIn 1926 when de Valera left Sinn F\u00E9in to found his own republican party, Fianna F\u00E1il, \u00D3 Ceallaigh followed him, becoming one of the party's founding members. In 1932, when de Valera, was appointed President of the Executive Council (prime minister) of the Irish Free State he made \u00D3 Ceallaigh Minister for Local Government. \u00D3 Ceallaigh often tried to publicly humiliate the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, James McNeill. Stunts such as withdrawing the Irish Army's band from playing at diplomatic functions which the Governor-General attended, or in one notorious case the sight of O'Kelly and Defence Minister Frank Aiken storming out of a diplomatic function at the French Legation when McNeill, the guest of honour, arrived, damaged \u00D3 Ceallaigh's reputation and image, particularly when the campaign backfired.\nBefore resigning, McNeill published his letters to de Valera about this. It made de Valera appear foolish, and made de Valera choose a new Governor-General. To the surprise of many, \u00D3 Ceallaigh's was not considered for the office. Instead former Fianna F\u00E1il TD, Domhnall Ua Buachalla from County Kildare, would be the last Governor-General.\nConsidered for President of Ireland in 1938.\nIn 1938, many thought that de Valera wanted to make \u00D3 Ceallaigh the Fianna F\u00E1il choice to become President of Ireland, under the new Irish constitution, Bunreacht na h\u00C9ireann. When Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alfie Byrne, said he wanted to be president there was an all party agreement to nominate Dubhghlas de h\u00CDde, a Protestant Irish Senator, Irish language enthusiast and founder of the Conradh na Gaeilge. They thought de h\u00CDde was the only person who might win an election against Alfie Byrne. \u00D3 Ceallaigh was appointed Minister of Finance instead, and helped create Central Bank in 1942.\nPresident of Ireland.\n\u00D3 Ceallaigh left the cabinet in 1945 when he was elected President of Ireland in a popular vote of the people, defeating two other candidates.\n\u00D3 Ceallaigh was re-elected unopposed in 1952. During his second term he visited many nations in Europe and spoke to the United States Congress in 1959. He retired at the end of his second term in 1959, to be replaced by his old friend, \u00C9amon de Valera.\n\u00D3 Ceallaigh did not refer any Bills to the Supreme Court to see if they were legal, but he did ask his official advisors, called the Council of State, if he should refer the Health Bill, 1947 but he decided not to.\n\u00D3 Ceallaigh's Roman Catholic Beliefs.\n\u00D3 Ceallaigh's strong Roman Catholic beliefs sometimes caused problems. de Valera often thought that \u00D3 Ceallaigh either deliberately or accidentally leaked information to the Knights of Columbanus, and the Church leaders. \u00D3 Ceallaigh ensured that his first state visit, following the creation of the Republic of Ireland in 1949, was to the Vatican to meet Pope Pius XII. \u00D3 Ceallaigh accidentally revealed the Pope's private views on communism. This angered the Pope and Stalin. This is why he was not given the papal Order of Christ which was given to many Catholic heads of state.\nAfter he retired.\nWhen he retired as president in 1959, he was described as a model President by the normally hostile Irish Times newspaper. Though controversial, \u00D3 Ceallaigh was widely seen as a genuine and honest, but tactless.\nHe died on November 23, 1966 (aged\u00A084), fifty years after the Easter Rising that first brought him to prominence. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.\nMary Kate Ryan and \u00D3 Ceallaigh were married from 1918 until Mary Kate's death in 1934.\nIn 1936 he married his second wife Phyllis, who was Mary Kate's sister. Another sister was married to Fine Gael leader General Richard Mulcahy, and a brother was Fianna F\u00E1il minister, James Ryan. O'Kelly died in Dublin.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_Ireland","surface_form":"President of Ireland","offset":73},{"uri":"D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann","surface_form":"D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann","offset":153},{"uri":"Vice-President_of_the_Executive_Council_of_the_Irish_Free_State","surface_form":"Vice-President of the Executive Council","offset":340},{"uri":"T%C3%A1naiste","surface_form":"T\u00E1naiste","offset":419},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":494},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":541},{"uri":"National_Library_of_Ireland","surface_form":"National Library of Ireland","offset":563},{"uri":"Gaelic_League","surface_form":"Gaelic League","offset":651},{"uri":"Sinn_F%C3%A9in","surface_form":"Sinn F\u00E9in","offset":783},{"uri":"Dual-monarchy","surface_form":"dual-monarchy","offset":818},{"uri":"Dublin_Corporation","surface_form":"Dublin Corporation","offset":923},{"uri":"P%C3%A1draig_Pearse","surface_form":"P\u00E1draig Pearse","offset":1009},{"uri":"Easter_Rising","surface_form":"Easter Rising","offset":1090},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"UK","offset":1241},{"uri":"College_Green","surface_form":"College Green","offset":1341},{"uri":"D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann","surface_form":"D\u00E1il \u00C9ireann","offset":1533},{"uri":"Ceann_Comhairle","surface_form":"Ceann Comhairle","offset":1573},{"uri":"First_D%C3%A1il","surface_form":"First D\u00E1il","offset":1606},{"uri":"Irish_Republic","surface_form":"Irish Republic","offset":1629},{"uri":"Paris_Peace_Conference","surface_form":"Versailles","offset":1707},{"uri":"%C3%89amon_de_Valera","surface_form":"\u00C9amon de Valera","offset":1878},{"uri":"Anglo-Irish_Treaty","surface_form":"Anglo-Irish Treaty","offset":1933},{"uri":"Irish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Irish Civil War","offset":2216},{"uri":"Fianna_F%C3%A1il","surface_form":"Fianna F\u00E1il","offset":2455},{"uri":"President_of_the_Executive_Council_of_the_Irish_Free_State","surface_form":"President of the Executive Council","offset":2579},{"uri":"Governor-General_of_the_Irish_Free_State","surface_form":"Governor-General of the Irish Free State","offset":2756},{"uri":"James_McNeill","surface_form":"James McNeill","offset":2798},{"uri":"Frank_Aiken","surface_form":"Frank Aiken","offset":3003},{"uri":"TD","surface_form":"TD","offset":3464},{"uri":"Domhnall_Ua_Buachalla","surface_form":"Domhnall Ua Buachalla","offset":3468},{"uri":"County_Kildare","surface_form":"County Kildare","offset":3495},{"uri":"Bunreacht_na_h%C3%89ireann","surface_form":"Bunreacht na h\u00C9ireann","offset":3745},{"uri":"Alfie_Byrne","surface_form":"Alfie Byrne","offset":3795},{"uri":"Dubhghlas_de_h%C3%8Dde","surface_form":"Dubhghlas de h\u00CDde","offset":3884},{"uri":"Conradh_na_Gaeilge","surface_form":"Conradh na Gaeilge","offset":3976},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"United States Congress","offset":4464},{"uri":"%C3%89amon_de_Valera","surface_form":"\u00C9amon de Valera","offset":4580},{"uri":"Council_of_State_(Ireland)","surface_form":"Council of State","offset":4730},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Republic of Ireland","offset":5149},{"uri":"Holy_See","surface_form":"Vatican","offset":5189},{"uri":"Josef_Stalin","surface_form":"Stalin","offset":5319},{"uri":"Order_of_Christ_(papacy)","surface_form":"Order of Christ","offset":5366},{"uri":"The_Irish_Times","surface_form":"Irish Times","offset":5549},{"uri":"Glasnevin_Cemetery","surface_form":"Glasnevin Cemetery","offset":5791},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":5811},{"uri":"Fine_Gael","surface_form":"Fine Gael","offset":6008},{"uri":"Richard_Mulcahy","surface_form":"Richard Mulcahy","offset":6033},{"uri":"James_Ryan","surface_form":"James Ryan","offset":6090}]}
