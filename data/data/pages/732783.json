Historically, the procession of Saint Blas ran to charge of the men and the one of Saint \u00C1gueda to the women, but the natural evolution of the tradition has comported that in the actuality the Commissions of Saint Blas and Santa \u00C1gueda are exclusively formed by women that purchase a special leadership during the days of celebration. Saint Blas and Santa \u00C1gueda took importance during the Franco regime, since although it was forbidden to disguise, Mequinenza continued challenging the prohibition imposed by the authorities, a fact that boosted even more the popular rooting and the singular character of the tradition.\nFestivity.\nThe festivity initiates with the delivery of the Clave of Control to the Commissions of Saint Blas and Santa \u00C1gueda, to continue the day 3 February with the religious celebrations of Saint Blas and the day 5 with the ones of Santa \u00C1gueda.
