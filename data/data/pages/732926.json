{"id":732926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini%C3%A9_ball","text":"The Mini\u00E9 ball, or Minni ball, is a type of muzzle-loading spin-stabilized bullet for rifled muskets named after its developer, Claude-\u00C9tienne Mini\u00E9, inventor of the French Mini\u00E9 rifle. It came to prominence in the Crimean War and American Civil War.\nRifling, the addition of spiral grooves inside a gun barrel, givesa spin to a bullet, greatly increasing the range and accuracy of a gun. Before the Mini\u00E9 ball, balls had to be jammed down the rifle barrel, sometimes with a mallet, and after a relatively small number of shots, gunpowder leftovers built up in the spiral grooves, which then had to be cleaned out. The development of the Mini\u00E9 ball was significant, because it was the first projectile that was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun. Both the American Springfield Model 1861 and the British Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled muskets, the most common weapons used during the American Civil War, used the Mini\u00E9 ball.\nThe Mini\u00E9 ball did a lot if damage in the American Civil War. It made it really hard for surgeons to treat wounded soldiers because Mini\u00E9 balls shattered bones often.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Muzzleloader","surface_form":"muzzle-loading","offset":44},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":75},{"uri":"Musket","surface_form":"musket","offset":93},{"uri":"Claude-%C3%89tienne_Mini%C3%A9","surface_form":"Claude-\u00C9tienne Mini\u00E9","offset":128},{"uri":"Mini%C3%A9_rifle","surface_form":"Mini\u00E9 rifle","offset":173},{"uri":"Crimean_War","surface_form":"Crimean War","offset":215},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":231},{"uri":"Rifling","surface_form":"Rifling","offset":251},{"uri":"Mallet","surface_form":"mallet","offset":475},{"uri":"Gunpowder","surface_form":"gunpowder","offset":529},{"uri":"Springfield_Model_1861","surface_form":"Springfield Model 1861","offset":797},{"uri":"Pattern_1853_Enfield","surface_form":"Pattern 1853 Enfield","offset":836}]}
