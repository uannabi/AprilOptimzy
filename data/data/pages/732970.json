{"id":732970,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brian_May_Band","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Brian May Band was an English-American rock band formed by Queen guitarist Brian May. The band was originally formed in October 1991 for May's performance at Guitar Legends guitar festival in Seville, Spain. They toured with May to promote some of his studio albums.\nThe rhythm section for the band was Cozy Powell and Neil Murray, who had already worked together in Black Sabbath and Whitesnake. Spike Edney, who was the tour keyboardist for Queen between 1984 and 1986 took the keyboard spot.\nThe band soon went on a tour of the United States, Europe and Japan. The tour ended in December 1993, when May returned to the studio with fellow Queen band mates Roger Taylor and John Deacon for Queen's final studio album, \"Made In Heaven\". Meanwhile, Cozy Powell and Neil Murray returned to work with Black Sabbath, and both later joined Peter Green's Band.\nThe band reunited in 1998 to promote Brian May's \"Another World\" album. Eric Singer, of later KISS fame, was brought as the last minute replacement for Cozy Powell, who had died in a car accident earlier that year.\nIn 2005, both Jamie Moses and Spike Edney joined the Queen + Paul Rodgers collaboration on their worldwide tour.\nTheir only release was the live album, \"Live at the Brixton Academy\" in 1993.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":56},{"uri":"Queen_(band)","surface_form":"Queen","offset":76},{"uri":"Brian_May","surface_form":"Brian May","offset":92},{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":209},{"uri":"Rhythm_section","surface_form":"rhythm section","offset":288},{"uri":"Black_Sabbath","surface_form":"Black Sabbath","offset":384},{"uri":"Whitesnake","surface_form":"Whitesnake","offset":402},{"uri":"Keyboardist","surface_form":"keyboardist","offset":444},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":548},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":563},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":574},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":722},{"uri":"KISS","surface_form":"KISS","offset":966},{"uri":"Live_album","surface_form":"live album","offset":1227}]}
