It is a big development in computer graphics. It was first made to use Nvidia's Volta platform. Some of the first products for consumers that use DXR include the Nvidia GeForce 20 series of GPUs, which was announced in 2018. DXR came out as an extension to DirectX 12 instead of a new version of DirectX.\nThe Windows 10 October 2018 update includes the public release of DirectX Raytracing.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":41},{"uri":"DirectX","surface_form":"DirectX","offset":53},{"uri":"Raytracing","surface_form":"raytracing","offset":73},{"uri":"Nvidia","surface_form":"Nvidia's","offset":169},{"uri":"Volta_(microarchitecture)","surface_form":"Volta","offset":178},{"uri":"GeForce_20_series","surface_form":"GeForce 20 series","offset":267}]}
