They boarded a tour bus when the heating system broke down, which meant all the musicians, including Holly's band, had to board a Beechcraft Bonanza 35 plane bound for the next gig in Moorhead, Minnesota. After the time went to 1:00 a.m, pilot Roger Peterson lost control of the plane, which crashed into a cornfield, killing Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper instantly, ejecting them on impact.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":21},{"uri":"Rock_and_roll","surface_form":"rock and roll","offset":30},{"uri":"Buddy_Holly","surface_form":"Buddy Holly","offset":54},{"uri":"Ritchie_Valens","surface_form":"Ritchie Valens","offset":67},{"uri":"The_Big_Bopper","surface_form":"\"The Big Bopper\" J.
