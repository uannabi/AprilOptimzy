Iznassen literally means \"Those who send in the day\".\nTerritory.\nThe At-Iznassen territory represents an area bounded by the Moulouya river to the west, the Kiss river to the east and the Angad plain to the south. It thus includes the mountainous complex of At-Iznassen and the Triffa plain.\nMunicipality of Bni Drar\nRural commune of Ain Sfa\nRural commune of Bni Khaled\nNear the municipality of ElAioun Sidi Mellouk\nRural commune of Machraa Hammadi\nAin Regadda\nSidi Slimane Cherr\u00E2a\nSidi Bouhria\nLanguages.\nThe At-Iznassen speak a Zenati Berber dialect, as well as Moroccan Arabic.\nSince the 19th century, Arabic took over the Berber languages, mainly among the A\u00EFt Khaled and at the southern margins of the three other tribes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Berber_languages","surface_form":"Berber","offset":36},{"uri":"Berber_people","surface_form":"Berber","offset":85},{"uri":"Northeast","surface_form":"north-east","offset":114},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":128},{"uri":"1859","surface_form":"1859","offset":295},{"uri":"Bni_Drar","surface_form":"Bni Drar","offset":922},{"uri":"Ain_Sfa","surface_form":"Ain Sfa","offset":948},{"uri":"Bni_Khaled","surface_form":"Bni Khaled","offset":973},{"uri":"ElAioun_Sidi_Mellouk","surface_form":"ElAioun Sidi Mellouk","offset":1009},{"uri":"Machraa_Hammadi","surface_form":"Machraa Hammadi","offset":1047},{"uri":"Ain_Regadda","surface_form":"Ain Regadda","offset":1063},{"uri":"Sidi_Slimane_Cherraa","surface_form":"Sidi Slimane Cherr\u00E2a","offset":1075},{"uri":"Sidi_Bouhria","surface_form":"Sidi Bouhria","offset":1096},{"uri":"Moroccan_Arabic","surface_form":"Moroccan Arabic","offset":1178},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":1205},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1219},{"uri":"Berber_languages","surface_form":"Berber languages","offset":1240}]}
