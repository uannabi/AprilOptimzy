{"id":7337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Inertia is the resistance of the object to any change in its motion, including a change in direction. An object will stay still or keep moving at the same speed and in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by an external unbalanced force.\n\"Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight ahead, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.\" [Cohen & Whitman 1999 translation]\n\"Every object stays at rest or stays moving at the same speed unless something makes it change.\"Johannes Kepler gave inertia its name in \"Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae\"\u00A0(published in three parts from 1,617\u20131,621)\nAlbert Einstein developed the idea of Special Relativity based on Galileo's statement that it is impossible to tell the difference between a moving object and a stationary one without some outside reference to compare it against.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Motion_(physics)","surface_form":"motion","offset":74},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":104},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":248},{"uri":"Johannes_Kepler","surface_form":"Johannes Kepler","offset":554},{"uri":"Epitome_Astronomiae_Copernicanae","surface_form":"Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae","offset":596},{"uri":"Albert_Einstein","surface_form":"Albert Einstein","offset":674}]}
