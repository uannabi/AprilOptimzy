{"id":733714,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Frisian_languages","text":"=\"preserve\">The Anglo-Frisian languages are west-germanic languges, which include Anglic (or English) and Frisian. They are different from other West Germanic languages because of a number of sound changes. This is an old classification, which classified the germanic languages into the Anglo-Frisian languages, and Germanic languages (such as German).\nSince about the 1960s, the model is that there was a language called North Sea Germanic, which included all of these.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"West_Germanic_languages","surface_form":"west-germanic languges","offset":44},{"uri":"Frisian_language","surface_form":"Frisian","offset":106},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":344},{"uri":"North_Sea_Germanic","surface_form":"North Sea Germanic","offset":422}]}
