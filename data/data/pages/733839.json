The movie received positive reviews from critics, who liked its animation, visuals, writing, music, and vocals. It has grossed $1.406 billion worldwide, had the highest all-time worldwide opening for an animated movie, and is the second highest-grossing animated movie of all time and the third highest-grossing movie of 2019, as well as the 10th highest-grossing movie of all time.\nSami in Frozen II.\nThe character Kristoff is meant to be Sami, a group of indigenous people who live in northern Europe and Asia. Some people who saw the first \"Frozen\" complained that Kristoff was not a good way to show Sami because he is light-skinned and blond. This is called whitewashing. Although some Sami look like Kristoff, most have darker skin and hair. When making the 2019 sequel, \"Frozen II\", Disney signed a contract with Sami leaders and hired Sami experts to make sure the fictional Sami in the movie, the Northuldra, would be shown respectfully.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"3D_movie","surface_form":"3D","offset":58},{"uri":"Computer_animation","surface_form":"computer-animated","offset":61},{"uri":"Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios","surface_form":"Walt Disney Animation Studios","offset":97},{"uri":"Frozen_(2013_movie)","surface_form":"Frozen","offset":212},{"uri":"Chris_Buck","surface_form":"Chris Buck","offset":252},{"uri":"Jennifer_Lee_(filmmaker)","surface_form":"Jennifer Lee","offset":267},{"uri":"Peter_Del_Vecho","surface_form":"Peter Del Vecho","offset":290},{"uri":"Kristen_Anderson-Lopez","surface_form":"Kristen Anderson-Lopez","offset":319},{"uri":"Robert_Lopez","surface_form":"Robert Lopez","offset":346},{"uri":"Christophe_Beck","surface_form":"Christophe Beck","offset":373},{"uri":"Byron_Howard","surface_form":"Byron Howard","offset":520},{"uri":"Kristen_Bell","surface_form":"Kristen Bell","offset":582},{"uri":"Idina_Menzel","surface_form":"Idina Menzel","offset":596},{"uri":"Josh_Gad","surface_form":"Josh Gad","offset":610},{"uri":"Jonathan_Groff","surface_form":"Jonathan Groff","offset":620},{"uri":"Ciar%C3%A1n_Hinds","surface_form":"Ciar\u00E1n Hinds","offset":640},{"uri":"Sterling_K._Brown","surface_form":"Sterling K.
