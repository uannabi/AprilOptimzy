{"id":734051,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_One","text":"\"Screen One\" is a British television anthology drama series, produced by BBC Studios and distributed by BBC Worldwide. It was shown on BBC1 between 1989 and 1998. Sixty films were made over six series. Some were shown as stand-alone specials.\nThe BBC's \"Play for Today\" ran from 1970 to 1984. After it ended, Kenneth Trodd was asked to make a new series of one-off television dramas. These became \"Screen Two\". They were shown on BBC2 in 1985. \"Play for Today\" had often been a studio-based form of theatre on television. \"Screen Two\" was shot entirely on film.\nIn 1989, the series was adapted for more mainstream audiences on BBC1 as \"Screen One\". It followed the lead taken by Channel 4, whose television films had later been released in Cinemas. \"Screen One\" had actors familiar to television and film audiences, including Alfred Molina, Sean Bean, David Thewlis, Ray Winstone, Alan Bates, Judi Dench, James Fox, Keith Allen, Bob Peck, Alun Armstrong, Marina Sirtis, David Jason, Brenda Blethyn, James Bolam, Adrian Edmondson, Alison Steadman, Timothy West, Clive Russell and Janet McTeer. Several actors also made their on-screen debuts during the series, including Keira Knightley in the fifth series episode \"Royal Celebration\".\nIn 1993, the BBC moved away from single dramas to make series and serials. In 1994, \"Screen One\" was a six-episode series. This was the last full-length series of \"Screen One\". Eight one-off specials followed. The last one was shown on 15 February 1998.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_television","surface_form":"British television","offset":18},{"uri":"Anthology","surface_form":"anthology","offset":37},{"uri":"BBC_Studios","surface_form":"BBC Studios","offset":73},{"uri":"BBC_Worldwide","surface_form":"BBC Worldwide","offset":104},{"uri":"BBC_One","surface_form":"BBC1","offset":135},{"uri":"Play_for_Today","surface_form":"Play for Today","offset":254},{"uri":"Kenneth_Trodd","surface_form":"Kenneth Trodd","offset":309},{"uri":"Screen_Two","surface_form":"Screen Two","offset":398},{"uri":"BBC_Two","surface_form":"BBC2","offset":430},{"uri":"Channel_4","surface_form":"Channel 4","offset":679},{"uri":"Cinemas","surface_form":"Cinemas","offset":740},{"uri":"Alfred_Molina","surface_form":"Alfred Molina","offset":826},{"uri":"Sean_Bean","surface_form":"Sean Bean","offset":841},{"uri":"David_Thewlis","surface_form":"David Thewlis","offset":852},{"uri":"Ray_Winstone","surface_form":"Ray Winstone","offset":867},{"uri":"Alan_Bates","surface_form":"Alan Bates","offset":881},{"uri":"Judi_Dench","surface_form":"Judi Dench","offset":893},{"uri":"James_Fox","surface_form":"James Fox","offset":905},{"uri":"Keith_Allen_(actor)","surface_form":"Keith Allen","offset":916},{"uri":"Bob_Peck","surface_form":"Bob Peck","offset":929},{"uri":"Alun_Armstrong","surface_form":"Alun Armstrong","offset":939},{"uri":"Marina_Sirtis","surface_form":"Marina Sirtis","offset":955},{"uri":"David_Jason","surface_form":"David Jason","offset":970},{"uri":"Brenda_Blethyn","surface_form":"Brenda Blethyn","offset":983},{"uri":"James_Bolam","surface_form":"James Bolam","offset":999},{"uri":"Adrian_Edmondson","surface_form":"Adrian Edmondson","offset":1012},{"uri":"Alison_Steadman","surface_form":"Alison Steadman","offset":1030},{"uri":"Timothy_West","surface_form":"Timothy West","offset":1047},{"uri":"Clive_Russell","surface_form":"Clive Russell","offset":1061},{"uri":"Janet_McTeer","surface_form":"Janet McTeer","offset":1079},{"uri":"Keira_Knightley","surface_form":"Keira Knightley","offset":1170}]}
