{"id":734148,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suckless.org","text":"suckless.org is a group of programmers that work on minimalist (small) free software. The software is made to be as simple as possible. The group makes programs that closely follow the UNIX philosophy of \"doing one thing and doing it well\".\nHistory.\nAnselm R. Garbe started the suckless community.\nIn 2007, Garbe said there's a need for a \"Plan 9 lover's and C hacker Ubuntu\" which comes with the tools needed to create code in C. He suggested calling it 9ubuntu. Later, suckless made stali (Static Linux). Stali is an operating system with statically linked programs that can be run. It adheres to the suckless rules.\nThe program making team follows the rule that \"worse is better\". They follow the KISS principle (\"Keep it simple, stupid\").\nMeet-ups.\nIn 2013, the suckless.org community started planning yearly meet-ups.\nsuckless.org e.V..\nIn 2015, the legal entity suckless.org e.V. was created. It was created during a suckless meet-up. Its goal is helping suckless.org and other open source projects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free software","offset":71},{"uri":"Ubuntu","surface_form":"Ubuntu","offset":368},{"uri":"Open_source","surface_form":"open source","offset":984}]}
