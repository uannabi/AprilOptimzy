{"id":734171,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikramaditya","text":"e=\"preserve\">Vikramaditya was a legendary emperor of ancient India. He was the ideal king, known for his generosity, courage, and support of learning. Vikramaditya is featured in hundreds of traditional Indian legends, including those in \"Baital Pachisi\" and \"Singhasan Battisi\". His capital was at Ujjain (although some stories say Pataliputra or Pratishthana).\nAccording to the stories, Vikramaditya began the Vikrama Samvat era in 57 BCE after defeating the Shakas. Those who believe that he is a historical figure place him around the first century BCE. Other scholars believe that Vikramaditya is a mythical character, since several legends about him are fantastic in nature.\n\"Vikramaditya\" was a common title used by several Indian kings, and the Vikramaditya legends may be combined stories of different kings (particularly Chandragupta II).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legendary","offset":32},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":61},{"uri":"Baital_Pachisi","surface_form":"Baital Pachisi","offset":239},{"uri":"Singhasan_Battisi","surface_form":"Singhasan Battisi","offset":260},{"uri":"Ujjain","surface_form":"Ujjain","offset":299},{"uri":"Pataliputra","surface_form":"Pataliputra","offset":333},{"uri":"Pratishthana","surface_form":"Pratishthana","offset":348},{"uri":"Vikrama_Samvat","surface_form":"Vikrama Samvat","offset":412},{"uri":"Shakas","surface_form":"Shakas","offset":461},{"uri":"Mythical","surface_form":"mythical","offset":604},{"uri":"Fantasy","surface_form":"fantastic","offset":660},{"uri":"Chandragupta_II","surface_form":"Chandragupta II","offset":831}]}
