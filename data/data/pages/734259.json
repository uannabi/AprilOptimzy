(paresthesia) It has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia.\nPeople who experience ASMR have a \"low-grade euphoria\". which means they like it. It has \"a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin\". ASMR is often set off by some auditory or visual stimuli.
