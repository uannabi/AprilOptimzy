PMA is thought to be 4% of all motor neurone disease cases.\nThis is in different to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of MND, which affects both the upper and lower motor neurones, or primary lateral sclerosis, another rare MND variant, which affects only the upper motor neurons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Motor_neuron_disease","surface_form":"motor neuron disease","offset":68},{"uri":"Lower_motor_neuron","surface_form":"lower motor neuron","offset":117},{"uri":"Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","surface_form":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","offset":222},{"uri":"Upper_motor_neurone","surface_form":"upper","offset":311},{"uri":"Lower_motor_neurone","surface_form":"lower","offset":321},{"uri":"Primary_lateral_sclerosis","surface_form":"primary lateral sclerosis","offset":346}]}
