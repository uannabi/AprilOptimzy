It is one of nine structures included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00F9 and Monreale.\nThe cathedral was built in 1131 in the Norman architectural style. The island of Sicily had been conquered by the Normans in 1091. According to tradition, the king of Sicily, Roger II, made a vow to build a cathedral, after he escaped from a storm to land on the city's beach. The building has a fortress-like character and dominates the skyline of the surrounding medieval town. It made a powerful statement of the Norman presence.\nHistory.\nThe cathedral was built in an area, where peopke had lived for a long time. Today, a Roman road and aearly Christian mosaic show this. Construction began in 1131, the apse mosaics were begun in 1145, and the sarcophagi that Roger II provided for his tomb and that of his wife were put in place the same year. After 1172 the church suffered a period of decline. In 1215 Frederick II of Hohenstaufen moved the two sarcophagi to the Cathedral of Palermo. Construction of the cathedral was resumed soon after, the fa\u00E7ade ws completed in 1240. The Cathedral was consecrated in 1267 by Rodolphe de Chevri\u00EAres, Bishop of Albano.\nIn 1472 a portico, by Ambrogio da Como, was added between the two towers of the facade.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":32},{"uri":"Cefal%C3%B9","surface_form":"Cefal\u00F9","offset":59},{"uri":"Sicily","surface_form":"Sicily","offset":67},{"uri":"UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"UNESCO World Heritage Site","offset":120},{"uri":"Arab-Norman_Palermo_and_the_Cathedral_Churches_of_Cefal%C3%B9_and_Monreale","surface_form":"Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00F9 and Monreale","offset":156},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":231},{"uri":"Norman_architecture","surface_form":"Norman","offset":266},{"uri":"Roger_II_of_Sicily","surface_form":"Roger II","offset":402},{"uri":"Fortress","surface_form":"fortress","offset":523},{"uri":"Apse","surface_form":"apse","offset":836},{"uri":"Mosaic","surface_form":"mosaics","offset":841},{"uri":"Tomb","surface_form":"tomb","offset":919},{"uri":"Frederick_II_of_Hohenstaufen","surface_form":"Frederick II of Hohenstaufen","offset":1038},{"uri":"Cathedral_of_Palermo","surface_form":"Cathedral of Palermo","offset":1099},{"uri":"Rodolphe_de_Chevri%C3%AAres","surface_form":"Rodolphe de Chevri\u00EAres","offset":1249},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Albano","surface_form":"Bishop of Albano","offset":1273},{"uri":"Portico","surface_form":"portico","offset":1301},{"uri":"Como","surface_form":"Como","offset":1325}]}
