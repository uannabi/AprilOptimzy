{"id":734520,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism","text":"=\"preserve\">Henotheism is the adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group.\nHenotheism is sometimes defined as a monotheistic belief within a polytheistic world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
