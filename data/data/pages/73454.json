{"id":73454,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9ra-comique","text":"Op\u00E9ra comique is a French opera tradition. Many French operas from the early 18th century to the early 20th century are op\u00E9ras comiques. In this French tradition there is spoken dialogue as well as songs and dances. It developed from the popular vaudevilles.\nIn Paris there is a theatre called the Op\u00E9ra-Comique where these operas were performed. Although \u201Cop\u00E9ra comique\u201D means \u201Ccomic opera\u201D it is not necessarily comedy. Bizet\u2019s opera \"Carmen\" is probably the most famous op\u00E9ra comique, and it is a tragedy. By the late 19th century the op\u00E9ra-comique usually had no spoken dialogue. There was music all the way through (as there is in \"Carmen\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":19},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":26},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":77},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":103},{"uri":"Dialogue","surface_form":"dialogue","offset":178},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":198},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":208},{"uri":"Vaudeville","surface_form":"vaudeville","offset":246},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":262},{"uri":"Op%C3%A9ra-Comique","surface_form":"Op\u00E9ra-Comique","offset":298},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":414},{"uri":"Bizet","surface_form":"Bizet","offset":422},{"uri":"Carmen","surface_form":"Carmen","offset":437},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":521}]}
