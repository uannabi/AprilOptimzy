It is directed by Sharon Maguire. It stars Michelle Williams, Ewan McGregor, and Matthew Macfadyen. It is about a suicide bombing at the Emirates Stadium during an Arsenal F.C. match, and about the life of a woman who loses her husband and young son in the attack. It is based on the 2005 novel \"Incendiary\" by Chris Cleave.\nPlot.\nA young East Ender woman, played by Michelle Williams, is married to bomb-disposal officer Lenny, played by Nicholas Gleaves. They have a four-year-old son, played by Sidney Johnston.\nThe young mother is having an affair with a reporter called Jasper, palyed by Ewan McGregor. Lenny, their son, and about 1000 others are killed in a terrorist attack carried out by six suicide bombers at a football match.\nTerrence Butcher, played by Matthew Macfadyen, is in charge of the anti-terrorist division.\nJasper and Terrence try to comfort the mother. Both are also romantically interested in her.\nThrough Jasper's investigation into the bombing, the mother discovers the identity of one of the terrorists. She befriends his teenage son, played by Usman Khokhar. He only knows that his father is missing since the attacks. When he finds out what his father did, he panics and runs. This causes the police to suspect him to be a terrorist. When he tries to take something out of his pocket they think he has a gun or wants to trigger a bomb. They shoot at him, but he is unarmed. The mother, who tried to protect him, is wounded, but not severely. Later, the terrorist's wife and son apologize to the mother for his part in the killings.\nTerrence confesses to the mother that he knew that a suicide attack was going to happen and could have stopped it. He did not stop it so that he was able to continue his investigation of the terrorist group. He says that he did not know in which stadium it would happen, and also thought it would be of a smaller scale. Although he knew Lenny and his son would be going, he did not warn them.\nSometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, she writes a letter addressed to Osama bin Laden. He is assumed to be responsible for the attack.\nProduction.\nFilming began on 26 March 2007 in London, England. Scenes were filmed on location in Northampton Square and the Brunswick Estate in Islington, North London. Filming also took place at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium and around St Albans Cathedral, St Albans School, and Westminster Lodge.\nThe production also visited The Metropolitan Training College facilities near Gravesend to shoot the scenes at the football stadium, after the bomb has exploded.\nReception.\nThe film received poor reviews. Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five. He called it an \"ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone.\"\nPhilip French called it an \"ambitious British picture on an urgent topical subject [that] is torpedoed by a poor script.\"\n\"Time Out\" gave it two stars out of six. It wrote \"there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire\u2019s first film since \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" in 2001 that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis\"; the film at times seems like a \"study of guilt and grief\" and at other times a \"conspiracy thriller\" but \"ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film\u2019s half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":31},{"uri":"Film","surface_form":"film","offset":37},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":76},{"uri":"Soccer","surface_form":"football","offset":98},{"uri":"Sharon_Maguire","surface_form":"Sharon Maguire","offset":132},{"uri":"Michelle_Williams_(actress)","surface_form":"Michelle Williams","offset":157},{"uri":"Ewan_McGregor","surface_form":"Ewan McGregor","offset":176},{"uri":"Matthew_Macfadyen","surface_form":"Matthew Macfadyen","offset":195},{"uri":"Suicide_bombing","surface_form":"suicide bombing","offset":228},{"uri":"Emirates_Stadium","surface_form":"Emirates Stadium","offset":251},{"uri":"Arsenal_F.C.","surface_form":"Arsenal F.C.","offset":278},{"uri":"Incendiary_(novel)","surface_form":"Incendiary","offset":410},{"uri":"Chris_Cleave","surface_form":"Chris Cleave","offset":425},{"uri":"East_End_of_London","surface_form":"East Ender","offset":453},{"uri":"Michelle_Williams_(actress)","surface_form":"Michelle Williams","offset":481},{"uri":"Nicholas_Gleaves","surface_form":"Nicholas Gleaves","offset":553},{"uri":"Ewan_McGregor","surface_form":"Ewan McGregor","offset":707},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":778},{"uri":"Suicide_bomber","surface_form":"suicide bomber","offset":814},{"uri":"Soccer","surface_form":"football","offset":835},{"uri":"Matthew_Macfadyen","surface_form":"Matthew Macfadyen","offset":879},{"uri":"Anti-terrorist","surface_form":"anti-terrorist","offset":918},{"uri":"Osama_bin_Laden","surface_form":"Osama bin Laden","offset":2203},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":2314},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":2322},{"uri":"Northampton_Square","surface_form":"Northampton Square","offset":2365},{"uri":"Islington","surface_form":"Islington","offset":2412},{"uri":"North_London","surface_form":"North London","offset":2423},{"uri":"Leyton_Orient_F.C.","surface_form":"Leyton Orient","offset":2464},{"uri":"Brisbane_Road","surface_form":"Brisbane Road","offset":2480},{"uri":"St_Albans","surface_form":"St Albans","offset":2513},{"uri":"St_Albans_Cathedral","surface_form":"Cathedral","offset":2523},{"uri":"St_Albans_School_(Hertfordshire)","surface_form":"St Albans School","offset":2534},{"uri":"2008_Sundance_Film_Festival","surface_form":"2008 Sundance Film Festival","offset":2823},{"uri":"Philip_French","surface_form":"Philip French","offset":3034},{"uri":"Time_Out_(company)","surface_form":"Time Out","offset":3157},{"uri":"Bridget_Jones%27s_Diary_(film)","surface_form":"Bridget Jones's Diary","offset":3294}]}
