{"id":735013,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brittas_Empire","text":"\"The Brittas Empire\" is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.\nChris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.\nThe show ran for seven series and 52 episodes \u2014 including two Christmas specials \u2014 from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.\n\"The Brittas Empire\" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" poll.\nThe show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in \"The Brittas Empire\".\nPlot summary.\nGordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives.\nHelen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it increasingly difficult to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent.\nBrittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss.\nEpisodes.\n\"The Brittas Empire\" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called \"Get Fit with Brittas\".\nFor the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank.\nHowever, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith, Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent.\n'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre.\nIn 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix.\nDVD and VHS releases.\nAll seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s.\nCritical response.\nIn its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, \"The Brittas Empire\" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch.\nInfluence.\nThe show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and \"The Office\".\nSetting.\nThe exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sitcom","surface_form":"sitcom","offset":34},{"uri":"Andrew_Norriss","surface_form":"Andrew Norriss","offset":52},{"uri":"Chris_Barrie","surface_form":"Chris Barrie","offset":86},{"uri":"BBC_One","surface_form":"BBC1","offset":309},{"uri":"Britain%27s_Best_Sitcom","surface_form":"Britain's Best Sitcom","offset":445},{"uri":"Farce","surface_form":"farce","offset":492},{"uri":"Surreal","surface_form":"surreal","offset":503},{"uri":"Chris_Barrie","surface_form":"Chris Barrie","offset":819},{"uri":"Leisure_Centre","surface_form":"Leisure Centre","offset":898},{"uri":"Aldershot","surface_form":"Aldershot","offset":942},{"uri":"Pippa_Haywood","surface_form":"Pippa Haywood","offset":1207},{"uri":"Julia_St_John","surface_form":"Julia St John","offset":1435},{"uri":"Mike_Burns_(actor)","surface_form":"Mike Burns","offset":1602},{"uri":"Allergies","surface_form":"allergies","offset":1637},{"uri":"Harriet_Thorpe","surface_form":"Harriet Thorpe","offset":1768},{"uri":"Judy_Flynn","surface_form":"Judy Flynn","offset":1939},{"uri":"Tim_Marriott","surface_form":"Tim Marriott","offset":2101},{"uri":"Same-sex_relationship","surface_form":"partner","offset":2132},{"uri":"Russell_Porter_(actor)","surface_form":"Russell Porter","offset":2155},{"uri":"Children_in_Need","surface_form":"Children in Need","offset":2441},{"uri":"Royal_Variety_Performance","surface_form":"Royal Variety Performance","offset":2495},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":3001},{"uri":"Paul_Smith_(television_writer)","surface_form":"Paul Smith","offset":3182},{"uri":"Mike_Walling","surface_form":"Mike Walling","offset":3219},{"uri":"Ian_Davidson_(scriptwriter)","surface_form":"Ian Davidson","offset":3233},{"uri":"Sport_Relief","surface_form":"Sport Relief","offset":3756},{"uri":"Little_Mix","surface_form":"Little Mix","offset":3796},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":3864},{"uri":"Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation","surface_form":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","offset":3936},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":3977},{"uri":"VHS","surface_form":"VHS","offset":4002},{"uri":"Dad%27s_Army","surface_form":"Dad's Army","offset":4165},{"uri":"Are_You_Being_Served%3F","surface_form":"Are You Being Served?","offset":4179},{"uri":"Alan_Partridge","surface_form":"Alan Partridge","offset":4506},{"uri":"The_Office","surface_form":"The Office","offset":4526},{"uri":"Ringwood","surface_form":"Ringwood","offset":4648},{"uri":"Hampshire","surface_form":"Hampshire","offset":4673}]}
