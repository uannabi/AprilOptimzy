{"id":735033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Collectivism is a set of ideas and values, where the well-being of the group has a very high priority.\nThe German sociologist Ferdinand T\u00F6nnies described an early model of collectivism and individualism using the terms \"Gemeinschaft\" (community) and \"Gesellschaft\" (society). \"Gemeinschaft\" relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society.\nMax Weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people. Hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"ideas","offset":38},{"uri":"Value_(personal_and_cultural)","surface_form":"values","offset":48},{"uri":"Group","surface_form":"group","offset":84},{"uri":"Ferdinand_T%C3%B6nnies","surface_form":"Ferdinand T\u00F6nnies","offset":139},{"uri":"Individualism","surface_form":"individualism","offset":202},{"uri":"Max_Weber","surface_form":"Max Weber","offset":534},{"uri":"Geert_Hofstede","surface_form":"Hofstede","offset":786}]}
