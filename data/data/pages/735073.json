It is about\n14 kilometers or 9 miles northwest of Tuzla.\nHistory.\nIn June 1992, during the Bosnian War, the Serbs living in nearby villages, (namely Podpe\u0107, Tinja, Jasenica, Srebrenik, Gornji Lukavac) were forced to go to Smolu\u0107a Gornja by the Bosnian army. After that, Smolu\u0107a came under siege by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This meant that it had no water, food, electricity, or medicine. The Bosniak and Croat forces would not let the Red Cross in to the village. They did not let any food or medicine in, and they did not let sick and wounded people leave. During the siege, from June 18 to August 27, 1992, 50 Serbs were killed in the Smolu\u0107a area, and 149 in nearby villages. After the siege ended on August 29 1992, Smolu\u0107a was robbed and burned by Bosniak and Croat forces.\nThe Army of Republika Srpska ended the siege.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":20},{"uri":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":44},{"uri":"Lukavac","surface_form":"Lukavac","offset":91},{"uri":"Tuzla","surface_form":"Tuzla","offset":150},{"uri":"Bosnian_War","surface_form":"Bosnian War","offset":191},{"uri":"Army_of_the_Republic_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Bosnian army","offset":344},{"uri":"Army_of_the_Republic_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina","offset":402},{"uri":"Red_Cross","surface_form":"Red Cross","offset":562},{"uri":"Army_of_Republika_Srpska","surface_form":"Army of Republika Srpska","offset":910}]}
