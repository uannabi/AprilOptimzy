She was divorced after failing to produce a son.\nAnne Boleyn was next. She was beheaded after cheating on Henry and not producing a son.\nJane Seymour was really the only wife that Henry really loved. She gave birth to a son but died of natural causes.\nHenry fell in love with Anne of Cleves's Portrait, however she didn't look like she did on her picture. Thus causing Henry and Anne to get divorced.\nAt only 19 years old, Catherine Howard was next in line for the hand of the king. However, after Henry finds out about Catherine's affair, she lost her ring along with her head.\nLast in line was Catherine Parr. She was the last of the six wives and outlived Henry. Almost a year and a half later, after Henry's death, Catherine Parr died after giving birth to her daughter, Mary.\nThe six wives of Henry are a very important part of our history. Henry was a great leader and even created The Church of England. All thanks to his six wives.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
