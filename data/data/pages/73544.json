{"id":73544,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzal","text":"A quetzal is a brightly colored bird in the trogon family. They are found in forests and woodlands, especially in humid highlands.\nThese birds live in the Americas. The word \"quetzal\" was first used for the resplendent quetzal, a famous long-tailed quetzal that lives in Central America. The resplendent quetzal is the national symbol of Guatemala.\nThey are strongly sexually dimorphic, as usual with the males being brighter. Parts of the female plumageis brown or grey. These largely solitary birds feed on fruits, berries, insects and small vertebrates (such as frogs). Even with their famous bright plumage, they can be hard to see in their natural wooded habitats.\nIn Aztec times, the quetzal was worshiped as the god of the air. Its long tail feathers, which can grow up to 2\u00A0ft (60\u00A0cm) long, were highly prized for making into costume and head-dresses.\nSpecies.\nCrested Quetzal","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Trogon","surface_form":"trogon","offset":44},{"uri":"Forests","surface_form":"forests","offset":77},{"uri":"Woodlands","surface_form":"woodlands","offset":89},{"uri":"Humid","surface_form":"humid","offset":114},{"uri":"Highlands","surface_form":"highlands","offset":120},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":155},{"uri":"Resplendent_quetzal","surface_form":"resplendent quetzal","offset":207},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":271},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":338},{"uri":"Sexual_dimorphism","surface_form":"sexually dimorphic","offset":367},{"uri":"Habitats","surface_form":"habitats","offset":660},{"uri":"Aztec","surface_form":"Aztec","offset":673},{"uri":"Crested_Quetzal","surface_form":"Crested Quetzal","offset":869}]}
