{"id":735584,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_(biscuit)","text":"Penguins are bar shaped biscuits that are covered in milk chocolate. They are filled with chocolate cream. Pladis' manufacturing division McVitie's makes them at their factory in Stockport.\nHistory.\nThey were first made in 1932 by William McDonald, a biscuit manufacturer in Glasgow. They became a brand of McVitie's when McDonald joined with McVitie's and Price, MacFarlane Lang & Co and Crawford to create United Biscuits in 1948. Each wrapper has a joke or \"funny fact\" printed on it and designs that feature penguins that are often in styles like that of famous works of art. These designs are usually funny.\nIn the 1980s, Penguin became known for their television advertising slogan \"P...P...P...Pick up a penguin!\u201D\nIn October 1996, United Biscuits sued Asda because they said Asda said their own brand of \"Puffin\" biscuits were part of the Penguin brand. In March 1997, United Biscuits won the case. The court found out Asda had not broken any laws on how the Penguin brand could be used.\nUnited Biscuits was criticised for still using trans fatty acids in the cream filling of Penguins. By December 2007, United Biscuits began to publicly say trans fats are not in Penguins anymore.\nThe Tim Tam made by Arnott's in Australia was based on the Penguin. Occasional references in the media include tongue-in-cheek debates over which biscuit is better.\nSpin off brands.\nIn 2002, McVitie's made some versions of the Penguin biscuit: Penguin Chukkas, Wing Dings, Flipper Dipper, Splatz and Mini Splatz. There is a \u00A35 million promotional campaign for the biscuits. In 2008, McVitie's also made Penguin triple chocolate wafers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":58},{"uri":"Pladis","surface_form":"Pladis","offset":107},{"uri":"McVitie%27s","surface_form":"McVitie's","offset":138},{"uri":"Stockport","surface_form":"Stockport","offset":179},{"uri":"William_McDonald","surface_form":"William McDonald","offset":231},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":275},{"uri":"Asda","surface_form":"Asda","offset":759},{"uri":"Passing_off","surface_form":"said","offset":787},{"uri":"Trans_fat","surface_form":"trans fatty acids","offset":1042},{"uri":"Tim_Tam","surface_form":"Tim Tam","offset":1194},{"uri":"Arnott%27s_Biscuits_Holdings","surface_form":"Arnott's","offset":1210},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1222},{"uri":"Tongue-in-cheek","surface_form":"tongue-in-cheek","offset":1301}]}
