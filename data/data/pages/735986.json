{"id":735986,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peronism","text":"Peronism or justicialism is an Argentine political movement based on the ideas and legacy of Argentine president Juan Per\u00F3n (1895\u20131974). It has been an influential movement in Argentine politics. Since 1946 Peronists have won 10 out of the 13 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run. The main Peronist party is the Justicialist Party. The ideas of each president were different, but the general ideology has been described as \"a vague blend of nationalism and labourism\" or populism.\nJuan Per\u00F3n became Argentina's minister of labour after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946. He introduced social programs that benefited the working class, supported labor unions, and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy. In addition he helped industrialists. Per\u00F3n was very popular and gained even more admiration through his wife, Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers and was loved by the people. Due to rising inflation and other economic problems, the military overthrew Per\u00F3n in 1955. The Peronist party was banned and it wasn't until 1973 that open elections were held again. In the 1973 election, Per\u00F3n was again elected president. He died the next year and his widow, Isabel, took his place as president. Per\u00F3n's death had led to disunity and the military overthrew Isabel in 1976.\nPeronist Carlos Menem was president from 1989 to1999. His policies were very different from previous Peronists, he focused on privatization, free-market policies, and international relations. Peronist N\u00E9stor Kirchner was president from 2003 to 2007, and his wife Cristina Fern\u00E1ndez de Kirchner was president from 2007 to 2015. According to the Economist, the Kirchners returned to \"economic nationalism and near-autarky\". The ideology of the Kirchners is known as Kirchnerism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentine","offset":31},{"uri":"Juan_Per%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Juan Per\u00F3n","offset":113},{"uri":"Justicialist_Party","surface_form":"Justicialist Party","offset":337},{"uri":"Nationalism","surface_form":"nationalism","offset":466},{"uri":"Labourism","surface_form":"labourism","offset":482},{"uri":"Populism","surface_form":"populism","offset":496},{"uri":"1943_Argentine_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"1943 military coup","offset":582},{"uri":"President_of_Argentina","surface_form":"president of Argentina","offset":617},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":698},{"uri":"Labor_union","surface_form":"labor unions","offset":723},{"uri":"Eva_Per%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Eva","offset":915},{"uri":"Inflation","surface_form":"inflation","offset":1012},{"uri":"Revoluci%C3%B3n_Libertadora","surface_form":"overthrew Per\u00F3n in 1955","offset":1064},{"uri":"September_1973_Argentine_general_election","surface_form":"1973","offset":1139},{"uri":"Isabel_Peron","surface_form":"Isabel","offset":1275},{"uri":"1976_Argentine_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"overthrew Isabel in 1976","offset":1363},{"uri":"Carlos_Menem","surface_form":"Carlos Menem","offset":1398},{"uri":"Privatization","surface_form":"privatization","offset":1515},{"uri":"Free_market","surface_form":"free-market","offset":1530},{"uri":"N%C3%A9stor_Kirchner","surface_form":"N\u00E9stor Kirchner","offset":1590},{"uri":"Cristina_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Kirchner","surface_form":"Cristina Fern\u00E1ndez de Kirchner","offset":1652},{"uri":"Economic_nationalism","surface_form":"economic nationalism","offset":1771},{"uri":"Autarky","surface_form":"autarky","offset":1801},{"uri":"Kirchnerism","surface_form":"Kirchnerism","offset":1853}]}
