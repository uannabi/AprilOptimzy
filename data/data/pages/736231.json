The term \"monolatry\" was perhaps first used by Julius Wellhausen.\nMonolatry is different from monotheism, which asserts there is only one god, and henotheism, a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":24},{"uri":"Worship","surface_form":"worship","offset":83},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"gods","offset":112},{"uri":"Julius_Wellhausen","surface_form":"Julius Wellhausen","offset":212},{"uri":"Monotheism","surface_form":"monotheism","offset":259},{"uri":"Henotheism","surface_form":"henotheism","offset":312}]}
