One teacher of the Conservatory, who left a deep mark on Kyli\u00E1n\u00B4s professional development, was Zora \u0160emberov\u00E1, known for her world\u00B4s first interpretation of Juliet (1938) in Prokofiev\u2019s famous ballet.\nIn 1967 Kyli\u00E1n had received a scholarship to study at the \"Royal Ballet School\" in London,\nStuttgart Ballet.\nHe met John Cranko, choreographer, there, who offered him a contract, to become a member of his acclaimed \"Stuttgart Ballett\". Before taking up his contract, Kyli\u00E1n shortly returned to Prague, but on August 21st, 1968, the invasion of the communist \"Warsaw-Pact \" forces began. On the 28th of August, after taking part in many demonstrations against the occupation, Kyli\u00E1n left for Germany.\nIn Stuttgart Cranko asked Kyli\u00E1n to create choreographies for the company. His first work was \"Kommen und Gehen\", created with Marcia Hayd\u00E9e and Richard Cragun. In the early 70\u2019s Cranko invited Glen Tetley to become resident choreographer in Stuttgart. Tetley\u00B4s work made a great impression on Kyli\u00E1n, namely Tetley\u2019s understanding of movement, and its relation to space, was a revelation for Kyli\u00E1n.\nNetherlands Dance Theatre.\nIn early seventies, Kyli\u00E1n was invited to create his first choreography for the Netherlands Dance Theatre (\"Viewers-1973\"). Having created two more works for NDT (\"Stoolgame\" 1974 and \"La Cath\u00E9drale Engloutie\" 1975) the offer to become artistic director of NDT together with Hans Knill, was extented to him.\nThe creation of \"Sinfonietta\", to music of Kylian\u00B4s co-patriot Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek for the \"Charleston Festival\" in the USA in 1978 led to international recognition of the company. Subsequently many important international tours of NDT have taken place incl. Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Paris Opera etc.\nDuring Kyli\u00E1ns engagement in NDT (1975-2009), he has created more than 75 choreographies for the company. Further pieces he made for other worldwide companies, such as the Stuttgart Ballet, the Op\u00E9ra de Paris, the Munich Bayerisches Staatsballett, and the Tokyo Ballet.\nRealizing the importance of education of young dancers, Ji\u0159\u00ED Kyli\u00E1n and Carel Birnie, the managing director of NDT, have decided in 1978 to create a new company - NDT II, in which young people would get the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. After many years of directorship, Kyli\u00E1n saw the departure of many fine and interesting performers. It was in 1991 that he decided to create a small group for dancers, who find themselves in the precarious age between \"forty and death\". The world premiere of this \u201CSenior Company\u201D was created by choreographers: Hans van Manen, Mats Ek, William Forsythe and Ji\u0159\u00ED Kyli\u00E1n. The original dancers were: Sabine Kupferberg, Alida Chase, G\u00E9rard Lemaitre and Niklas Ek. The importance of this new development in dance was instantly recognized by the public as well as by the media.\nThis unique, three-dimensional structure, NDT I \u2013 mature dancers, NDT II \u2013 young dancers, NDT III \u2013 senior dancers, residing in its own theater, designed and built by architect Rem Koolhaas in 1987, placed NDT in a totally new category. It has become different from any other dance company in the world, and was recognized as such by being given various prestigious awards.\nFurther activities.\nIn the recent years Kyli\u00E1n\u2019s creativity is focused on film, video and photography. The films \u201CCarmen\u201D, \u201CSchwarzfahrer\u201D, \u201CBetween Entrance and Exit\u201D, \u201CScalamare\u201D and the photo installation \u201CFree fall\u201D were all created in collaboration with his lifelong partner and muse Sabine Kupferberg.\nIn 1988 Kyli\u00E1n established the Kylian Foundation in The Hague (originally named as \u201CKyli\u00E1n Choreographic Archive\u201D). In 2008 the Kylian Production BV was set up in the Netherlands and in 2017 Kyli\u00E1n Fund Prague was founded in the Czech Republic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Choreographer","surface_form":"choreographer","offset":81},{"uri":"Prague","surface_form":"Prague","offset":136},{"uri":"Czechoslovakia","surface_form":"Czechoslovakia","offset":145},{"uri":"Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek","surface_form":"Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek","offset":1880}]}
