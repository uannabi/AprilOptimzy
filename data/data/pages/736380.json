The original lineup included Bob Markley, Michael Lloyd, John Ware, and brothers Shaun and Danny Harris. The group recorded five studio albums, including one under the name, Markley, A Group. Their style has been described as one of the \u201C more offbeat acts to emerge during the psychedelic era\u201D.\nIn Los Angeles, during the group\u2019s early years, they were known for their elaborate psychedelic light shows which accompanied their live performances. The WCPAEB first recorded on the small FiFo record label the album \"Volume One\" in 1966. They recorded three albums on the larger Reprise label between 1967 and 1968. \"A Child\u2019s Guide to Good and Evil\" is generally considered their best work, but the band\u2019s commercial success was limited. After 1967, the WCPAEB was strictly a studio band. Two albums, \"Where\u2019s My Daddy?\" and \"Markley, A Group\", were released on independent record labels before the group broke up in 1970.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychedelic_rock","surface_form":"psychedelic rock","offset":70},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles, California","offset":102},{"uri":"Reprise_Records","surface_form":"Reprise","offset":734}]}
