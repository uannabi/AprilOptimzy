It is caused by parasites from the species \"Trypanosoma brucei\".\nPeople get African trypanosomiasis from the tsetse fly. Because of this, it is most common in certain areas of Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, where the tsetse fly lives. Researchers say that about 70 million people, in 36 countries, are at a high risk for getting sleeping sickness. As of 2010, sleeping sickness had caused around 9,000 deaths per year (compared to 34,000 in 1990).\nIn 2013, about 30,000 people had African trypanosomiasis. Also, about 7,000 more people were getting the disease every year. More than 80% of these people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nMedications can treat African trypanosomiasis. The treatment is usually done in a hospital, because the drugs have many side effects. For sleeping sickness that was not treated early, the medications used for treatment are based on arsenic, a poison. These medications are dangerous, and about 5% of people die from taking them.\nThe best way to protect against African trypanosomiasis is to protect against insect bites.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of African trypanosomiasis happen in two stages.\nThe neurological phase.\nThis phase begins when the parasite invades the central nervous system by passing through the blood\u2013brain barrier.\nIn this stage, one of the most common symptoms is trouble sleeping. This is where the name \"sleeping sickness\" comes from. People in this stage often cannot sleep normally, and may be up all night and then sleep during the day..\nWithout treatment, a person with African sleeping sickness will go into a coma; (thus the name) all their important organs will stop working; and they will die.Damage caused in the neurological phase cannot be fixed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Narcolepsy","surface_form":"Narcolepsy","offset":59},{"uri":"Infectious_disease","surface_form":"infectious disease","offset":125},{"uri":"Parasites","surface_form":"parasites","offset":161},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":180},{"uri":"Trypanosoma","surface_form":"Trypanosoma","offset":189},{"uri":"Tsetse_fly","surface_form":"tsetse fly","offset":254},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":321},{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"Sub-Saharan Africa","offset":340},{"uri":"Researcher","surface_form":"Researcher","offset":388},{"uri":"Factor_(medicine)","surface_form":"high risk","offset":460},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":763},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"Medication","offset":797},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":879},{"uri":"Adverse_effect_(medicine)","surface_form":"side effects","offset":917},{"uri":"Arsenic","surface_form":"arsenic","offset":1029},{"uri":"Poison","surface_form":"poison","offset":1040},{"uri":"Signs_and_symptoms","surface_form":"signs and symptoms","offset":1242},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"central nervous system","offset":1382},{"uri":"Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier","surface_form":"blood\u2013brain barrier","offset":1428}]}
