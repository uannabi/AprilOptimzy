{"id":736880,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_101","text":"U.S. Route 101, or U.S. Highway 101, (US\u00A0101) is a north\u2013south United States Numbered Highway that goes along the West Coast of the United States. It goes through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It goes alongside, and often joins onto, California State Route 1 when going through California.\nThe route starts in Los Angeles at the junction of the Interstate 5, Interstate 10, and California State Route 60. It goes west past the north side of Downtown Los Angeles towards the coast. It meets the coast near Oxnard and goes north along the coast from here. The main cities it passes through in California is Santa Maria, San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Eureka, California. In San Francisco, the route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge. The main cities the route passes in Oregon is North Bend, Florence, Newport, and Astoria. These cities are small, as no large cities are on Oregon's coast. It runs near to the Interstate 5, which goes through larger cities like Salem and Portland. In Washington, the main cities it passes through is Aberdeen, Forks and Port Angeles. It ends at the Interstate 5 in Olympia. The route is about in total.\nThe route used to be the main highway along the West Coast, but now most people use the Interstate 5 to go along the coast. The US 101 used to go south to San Diego, but the part of the US 101 between here and Los Angeles was totally replaced by the I-5 in the 1960s. When it first opened, the US 101 used small roads that had already been built. In 1933, a new highway with bridges and ramps was built so it was faster for people to use.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Numbered_Highway","surface_form":"United States Numbered Highway","offset":63},{"uri":"West_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"West Coast of the United States","offset":114},{"uri":"U.S._states","surface_form":"states","offset":167},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":177},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":189},{"uri":"Washington_(state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":201},{"uri":"California_State_Route_1","surface_form":"California State Route 1","offset":254},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":330},{"uri":"Interstate_5","surface_form":"Interstate 5","offset":365},{"uri":"Interstate_10","surface_form":"Interstate 10","offset":379},{"uri":"California_State_Route_60","surface_form":"California State Route 60","offset":398},{"uri":"Downtown_Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Downtown Los Angeles","offset":461},{"uri":"Oxnard%2C_California","surface_form":"Oxnard","offset":525},{"uri":"Santa_Maria%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Maria","offset":625},{"uri":"San_Jose%2C_California","surface_form":"San Jose","offset":638},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":648},{"uri":"Santa_Rosa%2C_California","surface_form":"Santa Rosa","offset":663},{"uri":"Eureka%2C_California","surface_form":"Eureka, California","offset":679},{"uri":"Golden_Gate_Bridge","surface_form":"Golden Gate Bridge","offset":741},{"uri":"North_Bend%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"North Bend","offset":807},{"uri":"Florence%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Florence","offset":819},{"uri":"Newport%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Newport","offset":829},{"uri":"Astoria%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Astoria","offset":842},{"uri":"Salem%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Salem","offset":989},{"uri":"Portland%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Portland","offset":999},{"uri":"Aberdeen%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Aberdeen","offset":1061},{"uri":"Forks%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Forks","offset":1071},{"uri":"Port_Angeles%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Port Angeles","offset":1081},{"uri":"Olympia%2C_Washington","surface_form":"Olympia","offset":1126},{"uri":"San_Diego","surface_form":"San Diego","offset":1319},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":1539}]}
