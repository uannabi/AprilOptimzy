Built by Zhuan Dao in the early 20th century to propagate Buddhism and to provide lodging for monks, this monastery is the largest Buddhist temple in Singapore.\nHistory.\nBetween 1920 and 1921, the Monastery was built on the a plot of land in Thomson Road that was donated by Tay Woo Seng, a Chinese businessmen. It was the first traditional Chinese forest monastery to be built in Singapore. Its name was taken from Kong Meng San (\"Bright Hill\", formerly \"Hai Nan Mountain\"), the place where the monastery is located at. The original temple consisted of a two-storey building, a shrine room, a visitors' room and living quarters.\nIn 1980, the temple began to build Evergreen Bright Hill Home, which opened in 1983, with the donation of S$5.3\u00A0million from Hong Choon's followers, He Hui Zhong's family's company.\nThe monastery opened the Buddhist College of Singapore on 13 September 2006. As the country's first Buddhist college, it offers a four-year bachelor's degree in Buddhism. Lessons were held within the temple until a new $35\u00A0million five-storey building is completed.\nOn 21 June 2008, the temple raised over $1\u00A0million for the reconstruction of schools destroyed in the 12 May Sichuan earthquake, by organising the Great Compassion; Great Aspiration Charity Show.\nPremises.\nThe modern day monastery premises consist of prayer halls, crematorium and columbarium which contains over 200,000 niches, bell and drum towers, and an outdoor statue of Avalokitesvara stands between the Dharma Hall and the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas. The Hong Choon Memorial Hall of the temple was built in 2004. Another notable feature of the monastery is a Bodhi Tree which was brought from the sacred Bodhi tree at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.

Other major events include the Qingming Festival.
