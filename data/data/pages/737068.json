{"id":737068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Siberian_Yupik_language","text":"Central Siberian Yupik is one of four existing Yupik languages. It is also known as Siberian Yupik, Bering Strait Yupik, Yuit, Yoit, \"St. Lawrence Island Yupik\", and in Russia \"Chaplinski Yupik\" or Yuk. It is spoken by the Yupik people in Siberia, and in two villages on St. Lawrence Island. It is an endangered language: Of the 1,200 residents of St. Lawrence Islands, fewer than 1,000 speak the language. On the Siberian mainland, about 200 of the 1,200 ethnic Yupik speak the language. The second most common Yupik language in Siberia is Naukan Yupik, with about 70 speakers.\nThere are two dialects: Chaplino Yupik is mainly spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula, Siberia, and St. Lawrence Island Yupik. The differences between the two dialects are small.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yupik_languages","surface_form":"Yupik languages","offset":47},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":169},{"uri":"Yupik_people","surface_form":"Yupik people","offset":223},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":239},{"uri":"St._Lawrence_Island","surface_form":"St. Lawrence Island","offset":271},{"uri":"Naukan_Yupik","surface_form":"Naukan Yupik","offset":541},{"uri":"Chaplino_dialect","surface_form":"Chaplino Yupik","offset":603},{"uri":"Chukchi_Peninsula","surface_form":"Chukchi Peninsula","offset":642},{"uri":"Siberia","surface_form":"Siberia","offset":661},{"uri":"St._Lawrence_Island_dialect","surface_form":"St. Lawrence Island Yupik","offset":674}]}
