{"id":7372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia","text":"Ammonia is a chemical. Its formula is NH3 (not to be confused with \"Ammonium\" that has a formula of NH4+). It is made from nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.\nWays it can be made.\nMany organic nitrogen compounds are in animal waste, including urine and guano. In the 19th century the Distillation (boiling for separation) of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste was the main source of ammonia. During the 20th century the Haber process using high temperature and pressure with catalysts (things that make reactions faster) became the main source.\nAmmonia in fish tanks.\nAmmonia is toxic. If a goldfish tank is dirty from their waste, the fish can suffer from ammonia burns which cause black spots or patches on their body. The tank must be large enough and have a filter.\nManufacture of ammonia.\nBecause of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia. The worldwide ammonia production in 2004 was 109\u00A0million metric tonnes. China produced 28.4% of the worldwide production (increasingly from coal as part of urea synthesis) followed by India with 8.6%, Russia with 8.4%, and the United States with 8.2%. About 80% or more of the ammonia produced is used for fertilizing agricultural crops.\nThe carbon dioxide is then removed either by absorption in aqueous ethanolamine solutions or by adsorption in pressure swing adsorbers (PSA) using proprietary solid adsorption media.\nHydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification, less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale production.\nAt one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at Vemork, using electrolysis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical","offset":13},{"uri":"Formula","surface_form":"formula","offset":27},{"uri":"Ammonium","surface_form":"Ammonium","offset":68},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":123},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":136},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":145},{"uri":"Nitrogen_compounds","surface_form":"nitrogen compounds","offset":186},{"uri":"Urine","surface_form":"urine","offset":236},{"uri":"Guano","surface_form":"guano","offset":246},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"Distillation","offset":277},{"uri":"Haber_process","surface_form":"Haber process","offset":417},{"uri":"Catalyst","surface_form":"catalyst","offset":472},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":576},{"uri":"Aquarium","surface_form":"tank","offset":597},{"uri":"Filter","surface_form":"filter","offset":759},{"uri":"Chemical_plant","surface_form":"chemical plant","offset":891},{"uri":"Ammonia_production","surface_form":"ammonia production","offset":948},{"uri":"Metric_tonnes","surface_form":"metric tonnes","offset":991},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1006},{"uri":"Urea","surface_form":"urea","offset":1090},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1118},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1135},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1161},{"uri":"Ethanolamine","surface_form":"ethanolamine","offset":1339},{"uri":"Adsorption","surface_form":"adsorption","offset":1368},{"uri":"Pressure_Swing_Adsorption","surface_form":"pressure swing adsorbers","offset":1382},{"uri":"Vemork","surface_form":"Vemork","offset":1812}]}
