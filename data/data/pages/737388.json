{"id":737388,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Fundamental_Beliefs","text":"The 28 fundamental beliefs are the core beliefs of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Adventists are opposed to the formulation of creeds, so the 28 fundamental beliefs are considered \"descriptors\", not \"prescriptors\"; that is, that they describe the official position of the church but are not criteria for membership. These beliefs were originally known as the 27 fundamental beliefs when adopted by the church's General Conference in 1999 additional belief (number 11) was added in 2005. The \"Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary\" is a way to say Adventist theological thought.\nThey might be grouped into: God, humanity, salvation, the church, Christian life, and the restoration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seventh-day_Adventist_theology","surface_form":"Seventh-day Adventist theology","offset":51},{"uri":"Creed","surface_form":"creed","offset":128},{"uri":"General_Conference_of_Seventh-day_Adventists","surface_form":"General Conference","offset":412}]}
