{"id":737514,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_christian_councils","text":"The early councils of Christian churches often set the theological boundaries of what came to be considered statements of Christian belief. The first council was in Jerusalem in 49AD. The issue which led to the meeting was the result of the work of Paul, leading people to faith in Jesus and planting churches in Asia Minor. Paul wanted the new believers and their churches to be accepted by the original church in Jerusalem and to be known in faith and fellowship as true churches. After discussion, Peter concluded that the churches and their faith should be recognized as being on equal with the believer in Jerusalem. James concluded the same and the church issued a letter affirming the same faith in both sets of churches. The letter is found in the book of Acts 15:23-29. The affirmation was to accept their biblical faith, as reported by Paul and Barnabas, and to ask them to not offend their brothers in Jerusalem.\nIn the history of Christianity in the West (Roman empire) there were seven ecumenical councils include the following: the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the First Council of Constantinople in 381, the Council of Ephesus in 431, the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The near Eastern churches attend the first three councils. The African and far eastern orthodox churches did not attend after Nicaea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
