{"id":737556,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galia_melon","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Galia melon, also known as sarda in Southeast Asia, is hybrid melon. It comes from a cross between the green-flesh melon cultivar 'Ha-Ogen' and the netted-rind melon cultivar 'Krimka'. It was developed in Israel at the Ne\u00B4ve Yaar Research Center of the Agricultural Research Organisation by Dr. Zvi Karchi. It was released in 1973, and named after Karchi's daughter, whose name means \"God's wave\" in Hebrew.The Galia melon can look like a cantaloupe the outside and a honeydew inside.\nRipeness is measured by color of the skin, when it starts turning from green to yellow. After cutting, uneaten pieces should be wrapped and refrigerated to keep flavor.\nThey are not difficult to grow. Galias are now grown in Algeria, Brazil, Guatemala, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Southern US regions, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":53},{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybrid","offset":72},{"uri":"Melon","surface_form":"melon","offset":79},{"uri":"Cultivar","surface_form":"cultivar","offset":138},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":222},{"uri":"Hebrew","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":417},{"uri":"Cantaloupe","surface_form":"cantaloupe","offset":456},{"uri":"Honeydew_(melon)","surface_form":"honeydew","offset":485},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":727},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":736},{"uri":"Guatemala","surface_form":"Guatemala","offset":744},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":755},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":765},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":772},{"uri":"Costa_Rica","surface_form":"Costa Rica","offset":802},{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":814},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":822},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":832},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":840},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":848},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":860}]}
