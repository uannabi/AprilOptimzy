{"id":737565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornussen","text":"Hornussen is sport played in Switzerland. Its name comes from the puck which is called a \"Hornuss\" (hornet) or \"Nouss\". When hit, the hornuss can whizz through the air at up to 300 km/h (186.4 mph) and creates a buzzing sound. It is a team sport, played between two teams of 16-20 players. Teams take turns to see how far they can hit the hornuss, while the other team attempts to stop it in the air with a type of bat, called a \"schindel\".\nTogether with Schwingen and Steinstossen, Hornussen is seen as a Swiss national sport. There are only a few teams in other countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":29},{"uri":"Hockey_puck","surface_form":"puck","offset":66},{"uri":"Hornet","surface_form":"hornet","offset":100},{"uri":"Schwingen","surface_form":"Schwingen","offset":455},{"uri":"Steinstossen","surface_form":"Steinstossen","offset":469}]}
