{"id":737739,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Apatheism (; a portmanteau of \"apathy\" and \"theism\") is the attitude of apathy towards the existence or non-existence of God(s). It is more of an attitude rather than a belief, claim, or belief system.\nAn apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or rejecting any claims that gods exist or do not exist. The existence of God(s) is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant.\nScientist and philosopher Ian von Hegner has argued that apatheism is an alternative to positions such as theism, atheism, and agnosticism, with implications that have been overlooked in modern philosophical discussions. Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism \"uncharted territory in the philosophy of religion.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portmanteau","surface_form":"portmanteau","offset":28},{"uri":"Apathy","surface_form":"apathy","offset":44},{"uri":"Theism","surface_form":"theism","offset":57},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":134},{"uri":"Theism","surface_form":"theism","offset":512},{"uri":"Atheism","surface_form":"atheism","offset":520},{"uri":"Agnosticism","surface_form":"agnosticism","offset":533},{"uri":"Philosophy_of_religion","surface_form":"philosophy of religion","offset":703}]}
