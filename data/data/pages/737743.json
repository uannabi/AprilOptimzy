{"id":737743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_noncognitivism","text":"=\"preserve\">Theological noncognitivism is the position that religious language \u2013\u00A0specifically, words such as \"God\"\u00A0\u2013 are not cognitively meaningful. It is sometimes considered synonymous with ignosticism.\nOne argument holds to the claim that definitions of God are irreducible, self-instituting relational, circular. For example, a sentence stating that \"God is He who created everything, apart from Himself\", is seen as circular rather than an irreducible truth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religious","offset":60},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":110},{"uri":"Meaning_(philosophy_of_language)","surface_form":"meaning","offset":137},{"uri":"Ignosticism","surface_form":"ignosticism","offset":192},{"uri":"Irreducible","surface_form":"irreducible","offset":265},{"uri":"Relational","surface_form":"relational","offset":295},{"uri":"Circular","surface_form":"circular","offset":307},{"uri":"Irreducibility","surface_form":"irreducible","offset":445}]}
