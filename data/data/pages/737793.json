{"id":737793,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Second Sudanese Civil War was a conflict from 1983 to 2005 between the central Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. It was largely a continuation of the First Sudanese Civil War of 1955 to 1972. Although it started in southern Sudan, the civil war spread to the Nuba mountains and the Blue Nile. It lasted for 22 years and is one of the longest civil wars on record. The war resulted in the independence of South Sudan six years after the war ended.\nRoughly two million people died as a result of war. The conflict also caused famine and disease. Four million people in southern Sudan were displaced at least once during the war. The civilian death toll is one of the highest of any war since World War II and was marked by numerous human rights violations. These include slavery and mass killings.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sudan_People%27s_Liberation_Army/Movement","surface_form":"Sudan People's Liberation Army","offset":124},{"uri":"First_Sudanese_Civil_War","surface_form":"First Sudanese Civil War","offset":193},{"uri":"South_Sudan","surface_form":"southern Sudan","offset":258},{"uri":"Nuba_mountains","surface_form":"Nuba mountains","offset":302},{"uri":"Blue_Nile","surface_form":"Blue Nile","offset":325},{"uri":"South_Sudan","surface_form":"South Sudan","offset":447},{"uri":"Refugees","surface_form":"displaced","offset":630}]}
