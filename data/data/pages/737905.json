{"id":737905,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, transfinite numbers are numbers that are \"infinite\" in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers, but not necessarily absolutely infinite. These numbers can be categorized into two types: transfinite cardinals and transfinite ordinals.\nTransfinite cardinals are infinite numbers used to quantify the different sizes of infinity\u2014of which there are many kinds. For example, the number formula_1 (aleph null) is used to refer to the size of the set of natural numbers (or other sets having the same size as the natural numbers). Other such numbers include formula_1 (aleph one) and formula_1. These are called aleph numbers.\nUnder continuum hypothesis, the number formula_1 is the same as the size of the set of real numbers. This number is sometimes referred to as formula_1 (or the cardinality of the continuum).\nAside from transfinite cardinals, transfinite ordinals also exist. These are numbers used to describe the ordering of sets. For example, the ordinal number formula_1 is the set of all finite ordinals. It is also the first transfinite ordinal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":71},{"uri":"Finite_set","surface_form":"finite","offset":124},{"uri":"Absolutely_infinite","surface_form":"absolutely infinite","offset":160},{"uri":"Cardinal_number","surface_form":"cardinals","offset":242},{"uri":"Ordinal_number","surface_form":"ordinals","offset":268},{"uri":"Aleph_null","surface_form":"aleph null","offset":436},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural numbers","offset":491},{"uri":"Aleph_one","surface_form":"aleph one","offset":606},{"uri":"Continuum_hypothesis","surface_form":"continuum hypothesis","offset":670},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real numbers","offset":751}]}
