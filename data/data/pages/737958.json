A few hours into his mission, he was shot down by a Soviet-supplied S-75 Dvina (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile near Banes, Cuba. \"The loss of the U-2 over Banes was probably caused by intercept by an SA-2 from the Banes site, or pilot hypoxia, with the former appearing more likely on the basis of present information,\" stated a CIA document dated 0200 hrs, October 28, 1962. Anderson was killed when shrapnel from the exploding proximity warhead punctured his pressure suit, causing it to decompress at high altitude.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_Air_Force","surface_form":"United States Air Force","offset":118},{"uri":"Cuban_Missile_Crisis","surface_form":"Cuban Missile Crisis","offset":215},{"uri":"Lockheed_U-2","surface_form":"U-2","offset":260},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":296},{"uri":"McCoy_Air_Force_Base","surface_form":"McCoy Air Force Base","offset":435},{"uri":"Orlando%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Orlando, Florida","offset":459},{"uri":"S-75_Dvina","surface_form":"S-75 Dvina","offset":545},{"uri":"SA-2_Guideline","surface_form":"SA-2 Guideline","offset":574},{"uri":"Surface-to-air_missile","surface_form":"surface-to-air missile","offset":590},{"uri":"Banes%2C_Cuba","surface_form":"Banes, Cuba","offset":618},{"uri":"Hypoxia_(medical)","surface_form":"hypoxia","offset":737},{"uri":"Pressure_suit","surface_form":"pressure suit","offset":963}]}
