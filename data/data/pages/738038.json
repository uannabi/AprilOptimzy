This was the first election since 1918 to be held on a weekend instead of a weekday.\nResults.\nThe election resulted in a hung parliament, with the three largest parties splitting the vote nearly evenly.\nFianna F\u00E1il secured the most seats, with 38, then returning and unopposed Ceann Comhairle giving them a 1-seat advantage. Sinn F\u00E9in finished with the most first-preference votes of any party and 37 seats to obtain the party's best showing since the foundation of the modern Republic of Ireland. Fine Gael, the party of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, finished third in both number of seats (35) and first-preference votes.\nSince a coalition needs the support of 80 or more TDs in the 160-seat D\u00E1il and no two parties have that many seats between them, any coalition would require the support of smaller parties or independent TDs to govern.\nPolling.\nThe chart below shows the results of opinion polls since the previous general election.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1918_Irish_general_election","surface_form":"1918","offset":107},{"uri":"Hung_parliament","surface_form":"hung parliament","offset":194},{"uri":"Fianna_F%C3%A1il","surface_form":"Fianna F\u00E1il","offset":276},{"uri":"Sinn_F%C3%A9in","surface_form":"Sinn F\u00E9in","offset":398},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Republic of Ireland","offset":550},{"uri":"Fine_Gael","surface_form":"Fine Gael","offset":571},{"uri":"Teachta_D%C3%A1la","surface_form":"TDs","offset":741}]}
