{"id":73857,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtung_Baby","text":"\"Achtung Baby\" is the seventh studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was put in stores on 19 November 1991. The album came almost two years after the lead singer, Bono, said that the band would \"have to go away and dream it all up again,\" after their 1988 album, \"Rattle and Hum\" was criticized.\n\"Achtung Baby\" shows a very big change in U2's sound because they began to use alternative rock and electronic sounds in the rhythm, more production, and more guitar effects, also including darker and more personal song words. The results were much more adventurous and less traditionally rock-based than their previous albums, and \"Achtung Baby\" is one of U2's best-selling and most-liked albums.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":30},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":46},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":52},{"uri":"U2_(band)","surface_form":"U2","offset":62},{"uri":"Bono","surface_form":"Bono","offset":163},{"uri":"Rattle_and_Hum","surface_form":"Rattle and Hum","offset":264},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":375},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic","offset":396},{"uri":"Guitar_effects","surface_form":"guitar effects","offset":455}]}
