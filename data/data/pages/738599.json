Three more died at a Munich hospital, resulting in 23 fatalities with 21 survivors.\nAn investigation said that the crash was caused by the slush on the runway, which slowed the plane too much to take off.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_European_Airways","surface_form":"British European Airways","offset":57},{"uri":"Slush","surface_form":"slush","offset":141},{"uri":"Munich-Riem_Airport","surface_form":"Munich-Riem Airport","offset":165},{"uri":"Manchester_United_F.C.","surface_form":"Manchester United","offset":221},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":239},{"uri":"Busby_Babes","surface_form":"Busby Babes","offset":269},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":391}]}
