Most demons work for \"The Source\" but some hate him. The Source of all Evil is a very powerful demon who rules the Underworld. The Charmed ones have killed The Source three times. There are different ranks of demons and the Charmed ones have faced them all. In some situation demons actually helped the Charmed ones. Demons try to kill the Charmed ones to impress the Source and all of the Underworld.\nThe Book of Shadows.\nThe Book of Shadows is the Charmed One's magical book. It contains spells, potions and information of various magical creatures such as demons and warlocks. The Book of Shadows has been around since beginning of the family line. The book has its own defensive power. Whenever evil tries to touch the book, it jumps away. Each generation has added to the Book of Shadows making it more and more powerful. For example, in the final episode, each of the sisters adds all that they have learned so that future generations of Halliwell witches can learn from their experiences.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":16},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":25},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":50},{"uri":"Sister","surface_form":"sister","offset":90},{"uri":"Witch","surface_form":"witch","offset":97},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"demon","offset":141},{"uri":"Warlock","surface_form":"warlock","offset":152},{"uri":"The_WB","surface_form":"The WB","offset":179},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"television network","offset":186},{"uri":"Episode","surface_form":"episode","offset":289},{"uri":"Ouija_board","surface_form":"spirit board","offset":452},{"uri":"Incantation","surface_form":"incantation","offset":483},{"uri":"Power","surface_form":"power","offset":518},{"uri":"List_of_demons_(Charmed)","surface_form":"Shax","offset":613},{"uri":"Spell","surface_form":"spell","offset":680},{"uri":"Power_of_Three","surface_form":"Power of Three","offset":763},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":835},{"uri":"Vanquish","surface_form":"vanquish","offset":849},{"uri":"List_of_demons_(Charmed)","surface_form":"Zankou","offset":871},{"uri":"Astral_projection","surface_form":"astral projection","offset":885},{"uri":"Magic","surface_form":"magic","offset":973},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":1099},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":1107},{"uri":"Whitelighter","surface_form":"Whitelighter","offset":1192},{"uri":"Telekinesis","surface_form":"Telekinesis","offset":1333},{"uri":"Emotion","surface_form":"emotion","offset":1550},{"uri":"Anger","surface_form":"anger","offset":1578},{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":1709},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":1878},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":2335},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":3397},{"uri":"Medic","surface_form":"medic","offset":3458},{"uri":"Elevate","surface_form":"elevate","offset":3558},{"uri":"Position","surface_form":"position","offset":3574},{"uri":"Elder_(Charmed)","surface_form":"Elder","offset":3586},{"uri":"Avatar_(Charmed)","surface_form":"Avatars","offset":3638},{"uri":"Mortal","surface_form":"mortal","offset":3711},{"uri":"Belthazor_(Charmed)","surface_form":"Belthazor","offset":3879},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":3974},{"uri":"The_Source_(Charmed)","surface_form":"Source of All Evil","offset":4118},{"uri":"Cupid","surface_form":"Cupid","offset":4453},{"uri":"Parole_officer","surface_form":"parole officer","offset":4667},{"uri":"Evil","surface_form":"evil","offset":4822},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"demon","offset":5519},{"uri":"Generation","surface_form":"generation","offset":5889},{"uri":"Experience","surface_form":"experience","offset":5943}]}
