It became known as one of the filming locations in the 2019 psychological thriller, \"Joker\". It was used when Arthur was dancing down these stairs while \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" played during the movie's climax.\nThe stairs appear in a promotional poster for the movie and have become a tourist destination. Both the stairs and Arthur's dance have become Internet memes. Many visitors reenact the scene from the movie, sometimes in Joker costume, to the point that the stairs have become crowded with sightseers.\nMany news articles say that the Joker Stairs have became a popular movie scene such as \"the ranks of well-known movie settings, like that of the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art\" seen in the 1976 American sports drama \"Rocky\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Highbridge%2C_Bronx","surface_form":"Highbridge","offset":115},{"uri":"The_Bronx","surface_form":"the Bronx","offset":137},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":148},{"uri":"Joker_(2019_movie)","surface_form":"Joker","offset":248},{"uri":"Rock_and_Roll_(Gary_Glitter_song)","surface_form":"Rock and Roll Part 2","offset":317},{"uri":"Internet_meme","surface_form":"Internet memes","offset":515},{"uri":"Rocky_Steps","surface_form":"the steps","offset":814},{"uri":"Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art","surface_form":"Philadelphia Museum of Art","offset":831},{"uri":"Rocky","surface_form":"Rocky","offset":899}]}
