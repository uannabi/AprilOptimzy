{"id":73895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laborschule_Bielefeld","text":"e=\"preserve\">Laborschule Bielefeld (Laboratory school Bielefeld) is school in Bielefeld, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The school was created in 1974. It is based on the ideas of Hartmut von Hentig. Laborschule Bielefeld tries new ways of teaching. The University of Bielefeld runs the school.\nLaborschule Bielefeld has students from grade 0 through grade 10. Each grade has 60 students in it with a total of 660 students in the school. Laborschule Bielefeld does not group children by age. It groups them by level of learning. In that way, there are groups of children of different ages that are together to learn. Only students in grades nine and ten get written marks for their work.\nThe school was rated with a PISA-Test. The test showed that students at the school were generally better at reading and in sciences than students of the same age who went to other schools.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":68},{"uri":"Bielefeld","surface_form":"Bielefeld","offset":78},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":89},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":113},{"uri":"Hartmut_von_Hentig","surface_form":"Hartmut von Hentig","offset":182},{"uri":"Teaching","surface_form":"teaching","offset":242},{"uri":"University_of_Bielefeld","surface_form":"University of Bielefeld","offset":256},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":323},{"uri":"Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment","surface_form":"PISA-Test","offset":718},{"uri":"Reading","surface_form":"reading","offset":798},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":813}]}
