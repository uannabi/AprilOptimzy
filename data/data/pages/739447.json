In the UK the corresponding term might be social democrat or liberal left. The Blair government would be an example. In the USA the ideology may be found in some part of the Democratic Party.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left wing","offset":75},{"uri":"Right-wing","surface_form":"right wing","offset":94},{"uri":"Continental_Europe","surface_form":"continental Europe","offset":262},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":289},{"uri":"Social_democrat","surface_form":"social democrat","offset":324},{"uri":"Liberal","surface_form":"liberal","offset":343},{"uri":"Tony_Blair","surface_form":"Blair","offset":361},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":406},{"uri":"Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":456}]}
