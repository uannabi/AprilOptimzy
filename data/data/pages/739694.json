{"id":739694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division","text":"e=\"preserve\">Long division is a method of dividing two numbers, using repeated multiplications and subtractions in a tableau. Because it is easy to do, it is usually taught in schools. There are other methods which are faster, or easier to program with a computer, but they are more difficult to understand and perform manually. If we have a large or complicated division problem, we can use long division to break it down into a series of easier calculations. Long division can also be done on polynomials as well.\nBasic case.\nLet's assume we want to divide 780 by 4. To do so with long division, we need to split 780 into digits -- 7 and 8 and 0 -- and then divide each one by 4, carrying any remainders to the next step.\n7 / 4 = 1 R 3 -- since we have a remainder of 3, we have to carry this down.\n38 / 4 = 9 R 2 -- we carry our remainder of 2 down.\n20 / 4 = 5 R 0 -- we have reached the end.\nBy using long division, we have found that 780 / 4 = 195.\nComplex case.\nLet's perform a similar calculation where our numbers do not divide easily: 468 / 12\n4 / 12 = 0 R 0 -- we cannot perform this division as 4<12, so we have to carry our dividend like a remainder.\n46 / 12 = 3 R 10 -- we carry our remainder of 10 down.\n108 / 12 = 9 R 0 -- we have reached the end.\nBy the same process we have found that 468 / 12 = 39.\nDecimal Answers.\nLet's follow the same process for numbers that give an answer with a decimal because they don't have common factors: 123 / 8\n1 / 8 = 0 R 0 -- we cannot perform this division as 1<8, so we have to carry our dividend like a remainder.\n12 / 8 = 1 R 4 -- we carry our remainder of 4 down.\n43 / 8 = 5 R 3 -- we have reached the end with a remainder, which we have to add to our final answer.\n123 / 8 = 15 R 3, which equals 15.375 (15 3/8).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"dividing","offset":42},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplications","offset":79},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtractions","offset":99},{"uri":"Schools","surface_form":"schools","offset":176},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":255},{"uri":"Polynomial","surface_form":"polynomials","offset":495},{"uri":"Greatest_common_divisor","surface_form":"common factors","offset":1435}]}
