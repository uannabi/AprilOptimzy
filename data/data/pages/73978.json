{"id":73978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregano","text":"Oregano (\"Origanum vulgare\"), also known as pot marjoram, is a species of \"Origanum\". It is native to Europe, the Mediterranean region and southern and central Asia. It is a perennial herb. It can grow to 20\u201380\u00A0cm tall. Its leaves are opposite each other. They are 1\u20134\u00A0cm long. The flowers are purple. They can grow 3\u20134\u00A0mm long. The name of the plant comes from the Greek \"origanon\" [\u1F40\u03C1\u03AF\u03B3\u03B1\u03BD\u03BF\u03BD]: oros [\u1F44\u03C1\u03BF\u03C2] \u201Cmountain\u201D and the verb \"ganousthai\" [\u03B3\u03B1\u03BD\u03BF\u1FE6\u03C3\u03B8\u03B1\u03B9] \u201Cdelight in\u201D.\nGrowing oregano for cooking.\nThe subspecies of oregano \"Origanum vulgare hirtum\" is an important herb. It is used for cooking, especially in Turkish cuisine and Italian cuisines. The leaves are used for cooking.\nOregano is often used for tomato sauces, fried vegetables and grilled meat. Together with basil, it adds much to the special character of many Italian dishes.\nOregano is an ingredient needed for Turkish cuisine. It adds flavour to the Turkish choban salad. It can be used separately. It can also be added to the lemon-olive oil sauce that goes with almost every fish or meat barbecues and some casseroles.\nOregano has an aromatic, warm and slightly bitter taste. The taste varies in intensity; good quality is so strong that it almost numbs the tongue, but the cultivars adapted to colder climates have often unsatisfactory flavour. The influence of climate, season and soil on the composition of the essential oil is bigger than the difference between the various species.\nThe related species \"Origanum onites\" (Turkey, Asia Minor) and \"O. heracleoticum\" (Italy, Balkan peninsula, West Asia) have similar flavours. A closely related plant is marjoram from Asia Minor. That plant has a completely different taste. This is because phenolic compounds are missing in its essential oil. Some breeds show a flavour intermediate between oregano and marjoram. The Oregano plant is also commonly found in the mediterranean region, and the black sea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":63},{"uri":"Origanum","surface_form":"Origanum","offset":75},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":102},{"uri":"Mediterranean","surface_form":"Mediterranean region","offset":114},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":160},{"uri":"Perennial_plant","surface_form":"perennial","offset":174},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":184},{"uri":"Flower","surface_form":"flower","offset":282},{"uri":"Turkish_cuisine","surface_form":"Turkish cuisine","offset":611},{"uri":"Italian_cuisine","surface_form":"Italian cuisine","offset":631},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":708},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":715},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":729},{"uri":"Basil","surface_form":"basil","offset":772},{"uri":"Turkish_cuisine","surface_form":"Turkish cuisine","offset":877},{"uri":"Turkish_choban_salad","surface_form":"Turkish choban salad","offset":917},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":1044},{"uri":"Barbecue","surface_form":"barbecue","offset":1057},{"uri":"Casserole","surface_form":"casserole","offset":1076},{"uri":"Aroma","surface_form":"aroma","offset":1103},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":1495},{"uri":"Asia_Minor","surface_form":"Asia Minor","offset":1503},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1539},{"uri":"Balkan_peninsula","surface_form":"Balkan peninsula","offset":1546},{"uri":"West_Asia","surface_form":"West Asia","offset":1564},{"uri":"Marjoram","surface_form":"marjoram","offset":1625},{"uri":"Phenolic_compounds","surface_form":"phenolic compounds","offset":1712}]}
