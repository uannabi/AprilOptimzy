{"id":7399,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British","text":"A British person or object comes from the United Kingdom of Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) and Northern Ireland. It is sometimes used by the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands (near France). It can also be used for some overseas places like Gibraltar (near Spain) or the Falkland Islands (near South America).\nThe term \"British\" is often used to describe something unique to the UK, for example British people, 'the British way of life' or 'the British weather'.\nA British person can also be called a Briton. A unique symbol of the \"British\" is the Union Jack flag which is recognised globally as a symbol of the United Kingdom. The flag is made up of a combination of the flags of the countries that are part of the United Kingdom.\nThe British Isles are Great Britain, Ireland, and some smaller islands. The British Isles include the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.\nAlthough being British is a collective identity, the countries of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales have separate identities and flags which make them unique.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":42},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":60},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":75},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":84},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":94},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":105},{"uri":"Isle_of_Man","surface_form":"Isle of Man","offset":151},{"uri":"Channel_Islands","surface_form":"Channel Islands","offset":170},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":192},{"uri":"Gibraltar","surface_form":"Gibraltar","offset":251},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":267},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":281},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":304},{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British people","offset":405},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":463},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":747},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":780},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"islands","offset":806},{"uri":"Republic_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Republic of Ireland","offset":868},{"uri":"Flag","surface_form":"flag","offset":1031},{"uri":"Unique","surface_form":"unique","offset":1053}]}
