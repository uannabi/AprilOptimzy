{"id":73993,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockapoo","text":"A Cockapoo (also called a Spoodle or Cockerpoo) is a hybrid dog. It is a mix of an American Cocker Spaniel and a Poodle; (in most cases the Miniature Poodle or Toy Poodle), or by breeding a Cockapoo with another Cockapoo.\nThe Cockapoo has been around since 1950 and the first dictionary reference was a 1960 Oxford English Dictionary citation. Because it is a mixed breed, it is not recognised by purebred kennel clubs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hybrid","surface_form":"hybrid","offset":53},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":60},{"uri":"Cocker_spaniel","surface_form":"Cocker Spaniel","offset":92},{"uri":"Poodle","surface_form":"Poodle","offset":113},{"uri":"Miniature_Poodle","surface_form":"Miniature Poodle","offset":140},{"uri":"Toy_Poodle","surface_form":"Toy Poodle","offset":160},{"uri":"Oxford_English_Dictionary","surface_form":"Oxford English Dictionary","offset":308}]}
