{"id":73997,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story","text":"=\"preserve\">The short story is a genre of literature. It is usually fictional narrative prose and tends to be more direct and less-detailed than longer works of fiction, like novels.\nShort stories are closely related to oral (spoken) story-telling traditions and prose anecdotes. They all develop the story very quickly and come to a conclusion quickly too.\nMany authors today release their short stories together in a book, instead of one at a time. A short story can be written in only 10 words or less.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional","surface_form":"fictional","offset":68},{"uri":"Narrative","surface_form":"narrative","offset":78},{"uri":"Prose","surface_form":"prose","offset":88},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":175},{"uri":"Anecdote","surface_form":"anecdote","offset":269}]}
