{"id":74,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_sausage","text":"e=\"preserve\">Breakfast sausage is a type of fresh pork sausage made from seasoned ground meat mixed with bread crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as British or Italian-style sausages.\nUsing breakfast sausages.\nBreakfast sausages are not cured or smoked like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen). Uncooked sausages should be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot soapy water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked.\nThey are usually fried or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at breakfast, often with cooked eggs, pancakes, and toasted bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as \"toad in the hole\" a cooked batter dish.\nTypes of breakfast sausages.\nDifferent types made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can now be found. There are also vegetarian types that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":50},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"sausage","offset":55},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":73},{"uri":"Ground","surface_form":"ground","offset":82},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":89},{"uri":"Bread","surface_form":"bread","offset":105},{"uri":"Curing","surface_form":"cured","offset":288},{"uri":"Smoke","surface_form":"smoked","offset":297},{"uri":"Refrigerator","surface_form":"refrigerator","offset":472},{"uri":"Refrigerator","surface_form":"freezer","offset":492},{"uri":"Soap","surface_form":"soap","offset":558},{"uri":"Frying","surface_form":"fried","offset":707},{"uri":"Breakfast","surface_form":"breakfast","offset":770},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":799},{"uri":"Pancake","surface_form":"pancake","offset":805},{"uri":"Toast","surface_form":"toast","offset":819},{"uri":"Beef","surface_form":"beef","offset":997},{"uri":"Poultry","surface_form":"poultry","offset":1022},{"uri":"Vegetarian","surface_form":"vegetarian","offset":1063},{"uri":"Tofu","surface_form":"textured vegetable protein","offset":1089}]}
