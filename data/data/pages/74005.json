There were some problems between the Swiss organisers and the IOC so the Games were cancelled again. The IOC then gave the 1940 Winter Olympics to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. Garmisch-Partenkirchen had hosted the 1936 Winter Olympics. The Games were to be held from February 2 - 11 1940.\nThe games were cancelled because of World War II.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sapporo","surface_form":"Sapporo","offset":134},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":143},{"uri":"Withdraw","surface_form":"withdrew","offset":178},{"uri":"Second_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"Second Sino-Japanese War","offset":210},{"uri":"St._Moritz","surface_form":"St. Moritz","offset":283},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":295},{"uri":"Swiss","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":345},{"uri":"Garmisch-Partenkirchen","surface_form":"Garmisch-Partenkirchen","offset":455},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":479},{"uri":"1936_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"1936 Winter Olympics","offset":526},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":637}]}
