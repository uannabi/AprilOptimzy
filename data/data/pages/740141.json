{"id":740141,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noticieros_Televisa","text":"Noticieros Televisa is the news division of Grupo Televisa, which produces national and local news for Televisa's TV channels and local stations across Mexico.\nIt is headed by Leopoldo G\u00F3mez, the Vice President of News for Televisa.\nHistory.\nAfter the last broadcast of \"24 Horas\" with Jacobo Zabludovsky on January 20, 1998, Televisa restructured its news division. From 1998 to 2000, Jacobo's son Abraham Zabludovsky hosted its 10 p.m. successor, simply titled \"Las Noticias\"; Joaqu\u00EDn L\u00F3pez-D\u00F3riga took over from 2000 to 2016.\nOther notable personalities who have hosted Televisa newscasts include Lolita Ayala, Guillermo Ortega, Adela Micha, Carlos Loret de Mola and V\u00EDctor Trujillo (\"Brozo\").\nNational newscasts.\nMost of Televisa's national newscasts air on its Las Estrellas network, covering key dayparts. Since 2016, Televisa's flagship 10 p.m. newscast, known as \"10 En Punto\", has been helmed by Denise Maerker. Its other weekday programs include \"Despierta\" (Wake Up), hosted by Danielle Dithurbide, and \"Al Aire\" with Paola Rojas in the mornings. The afternoon newscast \"El Noticiero con Karla Iberia S\u00E1nchez\" was moved from Las Estrellas to Nu9ve in 2018; it is that channel's only regular news program. The move left Las Estrellas without an afternoon newscast for the first time in decades.\nFOROtv.\nIn 2010, Televisa launched FOROtv, a channel devoted exclusively to news, analysis and documentary programming. FOROtv airs in Mexico City on XHTV-TDT (channel 4) and as a subchannel of 21 additional Televisa transmitters in large cities.\nRegional newscasts.\nOutside of its national news output, Televisa produces local news at each of its Televisa Regional stations; local newscasts, under such titles as El Noticiero, Las Noticias and Notivisa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["company"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Televisa","surface_form":"Televisa","offset":50},{"uri":"Televisa","surface_form":"Televisa","offset":223},{"uri":"24_Horas_(Mexican_TV_program)","surface_form":"24 Horas","offset":271},{"uri":"Jacobo_Zabludovsky","surface_form":"Jacobo Zabludovsky","offset":286},{"uri":"Abraham_Zabludovsky","surface_form":"Abraham Zabludovsky","offset":399},{"uri":"Joaqu%C3%ADn_L%C3%B3pez-D%C3%B3riga","surface_form":"Joaqu\u00EDn L\u00F3pez-D\u00F3riga","offset":479},{"uri":"Lolita_Ayala","surface_form":"Lolita Ayala","offset":600},{"uri":"Guillermo_Ortega","surface_form":"Guillermo Ortega","offset":614},{"uri":"Adela_Micha","surface_form":"Adela Micha","offset":632},{"uri":"Carlos_Loret_de_Mola","surface_form":"Carlos Loret de Mola","offset":645},{"uri":"V%C3%ADctor_Trujillo","surface_form":"V\u00EDctor Trujillo","offset":670},{"uri":"Las_Estrellas","surface_form":"Las Estrellas","offset":766},{"uri":"Denise_Maerker","surface_form":"Denise Maerker","offset":905},{"uri":"Danielle_Dithurbide","surface_form":"Danielle Dithurbide","offset":989},{"uri":"Paola_Rojas","surface_form":"Paola Rojas","offset":1029},{"uri":"Karla_Iberia_S%C3%A1nchez","surface_form":"Karla Iberia S\u00E1nchez","offset":1099},{"uri":"Nueve_(Mexican_TV_network)","surface_form":"Nu9ve","offset":1153},{"uri":"FOROtv","surface_form":"FOROtv","offset":1340},{"uri":"XHTV-TDT","surface_form":"XHTV-TDT","offset":1455},{"uri":"Televisa_Regional","surface_form":"Televisa Regional","offset":1653}]}
