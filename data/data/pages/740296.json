{"id":740296,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community","text":"The LGBT community (or LGBTQ community or GLBT community), also referred to as the gay community, is a loosely defined grouping of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, LGBT organizations, and subcultures, united by a common culture and social movements.\nThese communities generally celebrate pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality. LGBT activists and sociologists see LGBT community as a counterbalance to heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, sexualism, and conformist pressures.\nThe term \"pride\" or sometimes \"gay pride\" is used to express the LGBT community's identity. The LGBT community is diverse in political affiliation. Not all people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender consider themselves part of the LGBT community.\nGroups that may be considered part of the LGBT community include gay villages, LGBT rights organizations, LGBT employee groups at companies, LGBT student groups in schools and universities, and LGBT-affirming religious groups.\nLGBT communities may organize themselves into, or support, movements for civil rights promoting LGBT rights in various places around the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["ethnic group"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":131},{"uri":"Gay","surface_form":"gay","offset":140},{"uri":"Bisexuality","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":145},{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"transgender","offset":155},{"uri":"Subculture","surface_form":"subculture","offset":192},{"uri":"LGBT_culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":224},{"uri":"LGBT_social_movements","surface_form":"social movements","offset":236},{"uri":"Gay_pride","surface_form":"pride","offset":292},{"uri":"Sexual_diversity","surface_form":"diversity","offset":299},{"uri":"Individuality","surface_form":"individuality","offset":310},{"uri":"Human_sexuality","surface_form":"sexuality","offset":329},{"uri":"Heterosexism","surface_form":"heterosexism","offset":414},{"uri":"Homophobia","surface_form":"homophobia","offset":428},{"uri":"Biphobia","surface_form":"biphobia","offset":440},{"uri":"Transphobia","surface_form":"transphobia","offset":450},{"uri":"Sexualism","surface_form":"sexualism","offset":463},{"uri":"Conformity","surface_form":"conformist","offset":478},{"uri":"Political_affiliation","surface_form":"political affiliation","offset":625},{"uri":"Gay_village","surface_form":"gay village","offset":823},{"uri":"List_of_LGBT_rights_organizations","surface_form":"LGBT rights organizations","offset":837},{"uri":"Gay-straight_alliance","surface_form":"LGBT student groups in schools and universities","offset":899},{"uri":"LGBT-affirming_religious_groups","surface_form":"LGBT-affirming religious groups","offset":952},{"uri":"Movements_for_civil_rights","surface_form":"movements for civil rights","offset":1044},{"uri":"LGBT_rights","surface_form":"LGBT rights","offset":1081}]}
