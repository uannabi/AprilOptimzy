{"id":740938,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative-absolutive_language","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ergative-absolutive languages, sometimes called ergative languages, are languages where the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb behave the same way in a sentence. Both behave differently to the subject of a transitive verb.\nIn English and other nominative languages, the agent (\"doer\", \"she\" in \"She walked the dog\") of a transitive verb and the subject (\"doer\", \"she\" in \"She walked\") of an intransitive verb are both in the nominative case, and the object (\"done-to\", \"dog\" in \"She walked the dog\") is in the accusative case.\nIn an ergative language, the agent of a transitive verb is in the ergative case, while the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are in the absolutive case.\nSome examples of ergative-absolutive languages include Basque, Georgian, Mayan and Tibetan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":272},{"uri":"Nominative-accusative_language","surface_form":"nominative languages","offset":290},{"uri":"Transitive_verb","surface_form":"transitive verb","offset":367},{"uri":"Intransitive_verb","surface_form":"intransitive verb","offset":437},{"uri":"Nominative_case","surface_form":"nominative case","offset":471},{"uri":"Accusative_case","surface_form":"accusative case","offset":556},{"uri":"Basque_language","surface_form":"Basque","offset":815},{"uri":"Georgian_language","surface_form":"Georgian","offset":823},{"uri":"Maya_languages","surface_form":"Mayan","offset":833},{"uri":"Tibetan_language","surface_form":"Tibetan","offset":843}]}
