They did this to show Puerto Rican independence from American rule.\nThe people responsible for the attack were Lolita Lebr\u00F3n, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores Rodr\u00EDguez.\nThe shooting began at Representatives in the 83rd Congress, who were debating an immigration bill. Five Representatives were wounded, one seriously, but all recovered. The assailants were arrested, tried and convicted in federal court, and given long sentences. In 1978 and 1979, they were pardoned by President Jimmy Carter; all four returned to Puerto Rico.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Puerto_Rican_independence_movement","surface_form":"Puerto Rican nationalists","offset":92},{"uri":"United_States_Capitol","surface_form":"United States Capitol","offset":266},{"uri":"Lolita_Lebr%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Lolita Lebr\u00F3n","offset":400},{"uri":"Rafael_Cancel_Miranda","surface_form":"Rafael Cancel Miranda","offset":415},{"uri":"Andres_Figueroa_Cordero","surface_form":"Andres Figueroa Cordero","offset":438},{"uri":"Irvin_Flores","surface_form":"Irvin Flores Rodr\u00EDguez","offset":467},{"uri":"83rd_United_States_Congress","surface_form":"83rd Congress","offset":536},{"uri":"List_of_United_States_immigration_legislation","surface_form":"immigration bill","offset":572},{"uri":"Jimmy_Carter","surface_form":"Jimmy Carter","offset":803}]}
