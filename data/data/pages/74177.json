{"id":74177,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avet_Terterian","text":"=\"preserve\">Avet Terterian (1929 - 1994) was a leading Armenian composer, awarded by Konrad Adenauer prize.\nHe composed eight (completed) symphonies, an opera and several chamber works.\nSeveral of his symphonies are recorded (the date 1973 in the Musicweb review of the Melodiya recording of symphony 3 is probably a typographical error, since the publisher's listing also gives 1975 for the first performance of that work).\nYekaterinburg's annual music festival is named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1929","surface_form":"1929","offset":28},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":35},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":55},{"uri":"Konrad_Adenauer","surface_form":"Konrad Adenauer","offset":85},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":153},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber works","offset":171},{"uri":"Symphony","surface_form":"symphonies","offset":201},{"uri":"Yekaterinburg","surface_form":"Yekaterinburg","offset":425}]}
