{"id":74186,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria","text":"Eutheria is the taxonomical name for the main group of living mammals.\nThis taxon contains the placental mammals, of which humans are one species.\nEutheria was introduced by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880. Members of Eutheria are now found on all continents and in all oceans.\nThe terms 'Eutheria and 'Placental' do not mean quite the same thing. A few early eutherians in the Lower Cretaceous were not placentals. \"Eomaia\" is the earliest example.\nAll living Eutherians are placental mammals. This means that a Eutherian fetus is fed during gestation by a placenta. The offspring of Eutherians are carried in the mother's uterus until fully developed.\nEutherians are different from other mammal groups such as monotremes and marsupials which (like the earliest eutherians) are not placental.\nMonotremes, for example, lay eggs which protect the young until they are fully developed. Marsupials give birth to young who are not completely developed. Their young then move to a special pouch in the mother's body to continue their development.\nThe earliest known eutherian species is the extinct \"Eomaia scansoria\" from the Lower Cretaceous in China.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomical","offset":16},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":62},{"uri":"Taxon","surface_form":"taxon","offset":76},{"uri":"Placenta","surface_form":"placenta","offset":95},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":123},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":138},{"uri":"Thomas_Henry_Huxley","surface_form":"Thomas Henry Huxley","offset":174},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":244},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":266},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":374},{"uri":"Eomaia","surface_form":"Eomaia","offset":413},{"uri":"Fetus","surface_form":"fetus","offset":519},{"uri":"Gestation","surface_form":"gestation","offset":539},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"offspring","offset":568},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":620},{"uri":"Monotremes","surface_form":"monotremes","offset":708},{"uri":"Marsupials","surface_form":"marsupials","offset":723},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":819},{"uri":"Pouch_(marsupial)","surface_form":"pouch","offset":980},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":1067},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":1082},{"uri":"Eomaia","surface_form":"Eomaia scansoria","offset":1091},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1138}]}
