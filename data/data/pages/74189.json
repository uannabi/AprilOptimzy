{"id":74189,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetartiodactyla","text":"Cetartiodactyla is the taxonomical superorder which includes whales (and dolphins) and even-toed ungulates. The name was created by merging the name for the two orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla, into a single word.\nCetartiodactyla is used because it is thought that whales evolved from the artiodactyls. Because of this, their closest living land relative may be the hippopotamus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Taxonomy","surface_form":"taxonomical","offset":23},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"superorder","offset":35},{"uri":"Whale","surface_form":"whale","offset":61},{"uri":"Dolphin","surface_form":"dolphin","offset":73},{"uri":"Even-toed_ungulate","surface_form":"even-toed ungulate","offset":87},{"uri":"Cetacea","surface_form":"Cetacea","offset":169},{"uri":"Artiodactyla","surface_form":"Artiodactyla","offset":181},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolved","offset":273},{"uri":"Hippopotamus","surface_form":"hippopotamus","offset":367}]}
