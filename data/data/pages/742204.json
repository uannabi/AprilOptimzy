{"id":742204,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_gun","text":"The Lewis gun (or Lewis automatic machine gun or Lewis automatic rifle) is a First World War\u2013era light machine gun.\nHistory.\nThe Lewis gun was invented by U.S. Army colonel Isaac Newton Lewis in 1911, based on initial work by Samuel Maclean.\nThe start of the First World War increased demand for the Lewis gun. BSA began production, under the name \"Model 1914\". The design was officially approved for service on 15 October 1915 under the name \"Gun, Lewis.303-cal.\" No Lewis guns were produced in Belgium during the war; all manufacture was carried out by BSA in England and the Savage Arms Company in the US.\nProduction.\nThe Lewis was produced by BSA and Savage Arms during the war. The two versions were very similar, but there were enough differences to stop them being completely interchangeable. This problem was fixed by the time of the Second World War.\nDesign details.\nThe Lewis gun was gas operated.\nThe Lewis gun used a pan magazine holding 47 or 97 rounds.\nThe gun fired about 500\u2013600 rounds per minute. It weighed 28\u00A0lb (12.7\u00A0kg), only about half as much as a typical medium machine gun of the era, such as the Vickers machine gun. It could be carried and used by one soldier.\nFirst World War.\nDuring the first days of the war, the Belgian Army had put in service 20 prototypes (5 in 7.65\u00D753mm and 15 in.303) for the defense of Namur.\nAircraft use.\nThe Lewis was the first machine gun fired from an airplane. On 7 June 1912, Captain Charles Chandler of the US Army fired a Lewis gun from the foot-bar of a Wright Model B Flyer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["weapon"],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"First World War\u2013era","offset":77},{"uri":"Light_machine_gun","surface_form":"light machine gun","offset":97},{"uri":"U.S._Army","surface_form":"U.S. Army","offset":155},{"uri":"Isaac_Newton_Lewis","surface_form":"Isaac Newton Lewis","offset":173},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"First World War","offset":259},{"uri":"Savage_Arms_Company","surface_form":"Savage Arms Company","offset":578},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":842},{"uri":"Gas-operated_reloading","surface_form":"gas operated","offset":894},{"uri":"Pan_magazine","surface_form":"pan magazine","offset":929},{"uri":"Vickers_machine_gun","surface_form":"Vickers machine gun","offset":1122},{"uri":"Belgian_Army","surface_form":"Belgian Army","offset":1243},{"uri":"7.65%C3%9753mm_Mauser","surface_form":"7.65\u00D753mm","offset":1295},{"uri":"Charles_deForest_Chandler","surface_form":"Charles Chandler","offset":1444},{"uri":"Wright_Model_B","surface_form":"Wright Model B","offset":1517}]}
