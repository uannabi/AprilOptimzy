{"id":74229,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialisation_in_Australia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Australia's renewable energy industries cover many energy sources and stages of commercialisation. Renewable energy technologies make up about 6 per cent of Australia's total [http://www.solarpanelmelbourne.com/ energy] supply and some 8 per cent of Australia's electricity supply, with hydro-electricity by far the largest single contributor.\nGovernment policies have opened up more opportunities for \"new\" renewable energies such as wind power, photovoltaics, and solar thermal technologies. The use of these technologies helps to reduce greenhouse gases.\nAt the end of 2006, Australia had 817 MW of installed wind power capacity, mainly in South Australia. Initiatives are also being taken with solar power, ethanol fuel and geothermal energy.\nSurveys show that there is much public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Australia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Renewable_energy","surface_form":"renewable energy","offset":25},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":64},{"uri":"Renewable_energy_commercialization","surface_form":"commercialisation","offset":93},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":275},{"uri":"Hydro-electricity","surface_form":"hydro-electricity","offset":300},{"uri":"Wind_power","surface_form":"wind power","offset":448},{"uri":"Photovoltaics","surface_form":"photovoltaics","offset":460},{"uri":"Solar_thermal","surface_form":"solar thermal","offset":479},{"uri":"Greenhouse_gases","surface_form":"greenhouse gases","offset":553},{"uri":"Watt","surface_form":"MW","offset":609},{"uri":"Solar_power","surface_form":"solar power","offset":711},{"uri":"Ethanol_fuel","surface_form":"ethanol fuel","offset":724},{"uri":"Geothermal_energy","surface_form":"geothermal energy","offset":741},{"uri":"Energy_efficiency","surface_form":"energy efficiency","offset":843}]}
