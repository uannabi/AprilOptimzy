{"id":74242,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_(metalwork)","text":"e=\"preserve\">A smith, or metalsmith, is a person who makes things from metal.\nMetal smiths were very important before industrialisation because they made metal tools for farming (especially the plough) and weapons for fighting in wars. Because of the importance of smiths, the name of their craft ('Smith') turned into a surname.\nEtymology of smith.\nThe word smith means \"to hit\" or \"to strike\". Originally, smiths made things from metal by using a hammer.\nAs an English suffix, \"-smith\" at the end of a word means a craftsmen. For example, a \"locksmith\" makes locks.\nArtisans and craftpersons.\nThe ancient traditional tool of the smith is a forge or \"smithy\", which is a fire which allows compressed air (through a bellows) to heat the inside until it is hot enough for metal to melt so that it can be made into the shape that is required..\nThe term, \"metalsmith\", often refers to artisans and craftpersons who practice their craft in many different metals, including gold, copper and silver. Jewelers often refer to their craft as \"metalsmithing\", and many universities offer degree programs in metalsmithing, jewelry and blacksmithing as part of their fine arts programs.\nA \"tinker\" is a metalsmith who mends kettles, pots and pans. They were often poor, itinerant workers (walking from place to place looking for jobs).\nMachinists.\nMachinists are metalsmiths who produce high-precision parts and tools. The most advanced of these tools, CNC machines, are computer controlled and largely automated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":71},{"uri":"Industrial_Revolution","surface_form":"industrialisation","offset":118},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":160},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":170},{"uri":"Plough","surface_form":"plough","offset":194},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":206},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":230},{"uri":"Craft","surface_form":"craft","offset":291},{"uri":"Surname","surface_form":"surname","offset":321},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":432},{"uri":"Hammer","surface_form":"hammer","offset":449},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":463},{"uri":"Suffix","surface_form":"suffix","offset":471},{"uri":"Lock","surface_form":"lock","offset":561},{"uri":"Forge","surface_form":"forge","offset":642},{"uri":"Bellows","surface_form":"bellows","offset":716},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":969},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":975},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":986},{"uri":"Jeweler","surface_form":"Jeweler","offset":994},{"uri":"Kettle","surface_form":"kettle","offset":1212},{"uri":"Pot","surface_form":"pot","offset":1221},{"uri":"Pan","surface_form":"pan","offset":1230},{"uri":"Machinist","surface_form":"Machinist","offset":1336},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":1459}]}
