{"id":742734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_acetate","text":"=\"preserve\">Sodium acetate is a chemical with the compound CH3COONa. It is the sodium salt of acetic acid. Sodium acetate is an irritant, but has many uses.\nOn concrete.\nSodium acetate is used to reduce the effects of water damage to concrete. It does this by acting as a concrete sealant. Compared to epoxy, which is commonly used, sodium acetate is cheaper and does not damage the environment.\nPreparation.\nWhile sodium acetate is usually purchased, it can be produced in the laboratory by the reaction of acetic acid with sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, or sodium hydroxide.\nIndustrially, sodium acetate trihydrate is prepared by reacting acetic acid with sodium hydroxide using water as the solvent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemical","offset":32},{"uri":"Sodium_salt","surface_form":"sodium salt","offset":79},{"uri":"Acetic_acid","surface_form":"acetic acid","offset":94},{"uri":"Irritant","surface_form":"irritant","offset":128},{"uri":"Water_damage","surface_form":"water damage","offset":218},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":234},{"uri":"Concrete_sealant","surface_form":"concrete sealant","offset":272},{"uri":"Epoxy","surface_form":"epoxy","offset":302},{"uri":"Sodium_carbonate","surface_form":"sodium carbonate","offset":525},{"uri":"Sodium_bicarbonate","surface_form":"sodium bicarbonate","offset":543},{"uri":"Sodium_hydroxide","surface_form":"sodium hydroxide","offset":566},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":701}]}
