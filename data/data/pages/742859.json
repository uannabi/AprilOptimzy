{"id":742859,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inugami","text":"The Inugami () is a type of canine deity in Japanese mythology. He is described as a \"y\u014Dkai\" with the appearance of a dog, and often as a very powerful spirit whose have the power to possess a human being if he wants to, as well.\nIt is widely believed that, in order for an Inugami to be born, one must bury a dog in its entirety, leaving visible only the part of the neck and head. In this, while waiting for the dog's death, the person who buried it must tell him all his pains and evil deeds she has committed at some point, until he dies. When this happens, the person must then cut off the dog's head and sewe it back to the body, and thus the Inugami will arise.\nInugamis were often linked to important Japanese clans and families, and sometimes these same families were accused of having been possessed by a Kitsune (a spirit with the appearance of a fox) as well, gaining fame and power very quickly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"canine","offset":28},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"deity","offset":35},{"uri":"Japanese_mythology","surface_form":"Japanese mythology","offset":44},{"uri":"Y%C5%8Dkai","surface_form":"y\u014Dkai","offset":86},{"uri":"Possession","surface_form":"possess","offset":183},{"uri":"Clan","surface_form":"clan","offset":718},{"uri":"Kitsune","surface_form":"Kitsune","offset":815},{"uri":"Fox","surface_form":"fox","offset":858}]}
