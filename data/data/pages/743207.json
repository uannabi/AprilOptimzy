It was established in 1831 as being equal to the House, several reforms, most notably in 1993 and 2014. While the Senate today plays only a minor role in the legislative process, it still has, along with the House, full responsibility for the upholding of the Constitution and the organisation and functioning of the Country and Federal States. Following the 2014 reform, it now holds about ten sessions per year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sabine_Laruelle","surface_form":"Sabine Laruelle","offset":173},{"uri":"Mouvement_R%C3%A9formateur","surface_form":"MR","offset":221},{"uri":"New_Flemish_Alliance","surface_form":"N-VA","offset":569},{"uri":"Bicameral","surface_form":"house of the bicameral","offset":613},{"uri":"Belgian_Federal_Parliament","surface_form":"Federal Parliament of Belgium","offset":636},{"uri":"House_of_Representatives_(Belgium)","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":677},{"uri":"Reform","surface_form":"reforms","offset":767},{"uri":"Belgian_Reform_of_1993","surface_form":"1993","offset":792},{"uri":"Belgian_Reform_of_2014","surface_form":"2014","offset":801},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislative process","offset":861},{"uri":"Constitution_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":963},{"uri":"Partition_of_Belgium","surface_form":"Federal States","offset":1032}]}
