{"id":7437,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number","text":"Natural numbers, also called counting numbers, are the numbers used for counting things. Natural numbers are the numbers small children learn about when they first started to count. Natural numbers are always whole numbers (integers excluding negative numbers) and often exclude zero, in which case one is the smallest natural number. The set of natural numbers can be represented by the symbol formula_1.\nThere is no largest natural number. The next natural number can be found by adding 1 to the current natural number, producing numbers that go on \"forever\". There is no natural number that is infinite in size. Any natural number can be reached by adding 1 enough times to the smallest natural number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":55},{"uri":"Whole_numbers","surface_form":"whole numbers","offset":209},{"uri":"Integers","surface_form":"integers","offset":224},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative number","offset":243},{"uri":"One","surface_form":"one","offset":299},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinite","offset":597}]}
