{"id":74414,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possum","text":"The possum is an Australasian marsupial which was later introduced to China and New Zealand. There are about 69 species alive today.\nPossums are members of the Phalangeriformes. This is a suborder of the Diprotodonts, a large order which includes the kangaroos and its relatives.\nPossums are native to Australia and are protected there. Possums spend the first four months of their lives in their mother's pouch. By the time they are six months old, the young possums live outside the pouch.\nThey are nocturnal and at least partly arboreal. Some of the smaller species are gliders. They have sharp claws and a keen sense of smell. They eat the leaves of trees, insects, berries and bird's eggs.\nThe first possums were brought to New Zealand in 1837 from Australia. In New Zealand, possums have no natural enemies, so possum numbers increased quickly. It is thought of as a pest in New Zealand.\nThe possum has done a lot of damage to the native plants, animals and birds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australasia","surface_form":"Australasia","offset":17},{"uri":"Marsupial","surface_form":"marsupial","offset":30},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":70},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":80},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":112},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"suborder","offset":188},{"uri":"Diprotodont","surface_form":"Diprotodont","offset":204},{"uri":"Kangaroo","surface_form":"kangaroo","offset":251},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":501},{"uri":"Arboreal","surface_form":"arboreal","offset":531},{"uri":"Glider","surface_form":"glider","offset":573},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":754}]}
