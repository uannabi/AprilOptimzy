Johnson was the clinical director of Planned Parenthood and was very pro-choice. She then had to help with an abortion where the woman was thirteen weeks pregnant and realized that the fetus looked a lot like her baby did and she also thought that it looked like it was in pain.\nJohnson then decided that abortion was murder so she left Planned Parenthood and joined a Pro-Life group. Johnson wrote an autobiography called Unplanned which became a movie called Unplanned.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American","surface_form":"American","offset":40},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":95},{"uri":"Planned_Parenthood","surface_form":"Planned Parenthood","offset":142},{"uri":"Pro-choice","surface_form":"pro-choice","offset":174},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":215},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":234},{"uri":"Fetus","surface_form":"fetus","offset":290},{"uri":"Baby","surface_form":"baby","offset":318},{"uri":"Pain","surface_form":"pain","offset":378},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":410},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":423},{"uri":"Planned_Parenthood","surface_form":"Planned Parenthood","offset":442},{"uri":"Pro-Life","surface_form":"Pro-Life","offset":474},{"uri":"Autobiography","surface_form":"autobiography","offset":507},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":553},{"uri":"Unplanned","surface_form":"Unplanned","offset":566}]}
