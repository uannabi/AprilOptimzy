{"id":74452,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotha","text":"Gotha is a town in Thuringia, in Germany. It is the capital of the District of Gotha. The population was 46,205 in 2004.\nHistory.\nThe town has existed at least since the 8th century, when its name was mentioned in a document signed by Charlemagne, in which it appears as \"Villa Gotaha\" (\"Good Waters\"). In 1640 Gotha became the capital city of Saxe-Gotha. In the 18th century the French philosopher Voltaire stayed for a long time, and the Royal court became one of the centres of the Enlightenment in Germany. From 1826 to 1918, Gotha was one of the two capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\nGotha has played an important role in the Germany's workers' movement: the German socialist party (SPD) was founded in Gotha in 1875, when the Social Democratic Workers' Party, led by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, and the General German Workers' Association, founded by Ferdinand Lassalle joined together. The compromise was known the \"Gotha Program\" and was opposed by Karl Marx.\nGotha has also been traditionally a centre of publishing. The firm of Justus Perthes (now called Hermann Haack) began publishing the \"Almanach de Gotha\" in 1763. The almanach was a very important directory of the world's major ruling dynasties and Europe's high nobility.\nFrom 1949 to 1990 the city of Gotha was in the German Democratic Republic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thuringia","surface_form":"Thuringia","offset":19},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":33},{"uri":"Gotha_Rural_District","surface_form":"District of Gotha","offset":67},{"uri":"8th_century","surface_form":"8th century","offset":170},{"uri":"Charlemagne","surface_form":"Charlemagne","offset":235},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":328},{"uri":"Saxe-Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Gotha","offset":344},{"uri":"Voltaire","surface_form":"Voltaire","offset":399},{"uri":"Age_of_Enlightenment","surface_form":"Enlightenment","offset":485},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha","offset":580},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialist","offset":685},{"uri":"SPD","surface_form":"SPD","offset":702},{"uri":"August_Bebel","surface_form":"August Bebel","offset":787},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Liebknecht","surface_form":"Wilhelm Liebknecht","offset":804},{"uri":"General_German_Workers%27_Association","surface_form":"General German Workers' Association","offset":832},{"uri":"Ferdinand_Lassalle","surface_form":"Ferdinand Lassalle","offset":880},{"uri":"Karl_Marx","surface_form":"Karl Marx","offset":980},{"uri":"Justus_Perthes","surface_form":"Justus Perthes","offset":1061},{"uri":"Hermann_Haack","surface_form":"Hermann Haack","offset":1088},{"uri":"Almanach_de_Gotha","surface_form":"Almanach de Gotha","offset":1125},{"uri":"German_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"German Democratic Republic","offset":1310}]}
