The non-weight-bearing toes are either present, absent, vestigial, or positioned posteriorly.\nBy contrast, the even-toed ungulates bear most of their weight equally on two (an even number) of the five toes: their third and fourth toes. Another difference between the two is that odd-toed ungulates digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than in one or more stomach chambers as the even-toed ungulates do.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Odd-toed_ungulate","surface_form":"odd-toed ungulate","offset":49}]}
