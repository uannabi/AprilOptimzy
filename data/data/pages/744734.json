It replaced the Dazhimen Station that had been used since the rail line had started.\nLater, the Wuhan Metro line was also connected to the station. The new service started on 28 December 2012.\nThe station is near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. That market is one of the places where the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic is thought to have started. Thus, it may have spread partly through the station.
