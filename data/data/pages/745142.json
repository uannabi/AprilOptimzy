They also explained that if we should qualify, they are going to call in and examine new players. So hopefully they can beat Iraq and qualify for the Olympics, and hopefully I'll get my chance then. I think the problem is that I was in England for the past four years and that they weren't able to watch me play as much as the local players. That has been pretty disappointing for me.\"\nAbedzadeh was part of Iran's team for in 2014 AFC U-22 Championship, but he did not play any match. In 2015, he was invited to Olympic team for 2016 AFC U-23 Championship qualification.\nSenior.\nOn 5 November 2017, Abedzadeh was called into the Iran national team for the first time for friendlies against Panama and Venezuela.
