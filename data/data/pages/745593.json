Benjamin supported Brexit. He was in the United Kingdom Independence Party. He also ran for the European Parliament.\nOverview.\nBenjamin has created videos on YouTube calling himself Sargon of Akkad. Benjamin says that he is left-wing, but also thinks that freedom of speech is more important than abortion. In one of his YouTube episodes, he says that feminism has too much influence on video games. He has debated Richard B. Spencer and other people on the Alt-Right. He says that he dislikes Alex Jones, but suggests that the latter should not have been banned from YouTube.\nBenjamin supported Donald Trump in 2016 because he thought Trump was better than Hillary Clinton. Benjamin has at times said very controversial things like calling the Alt-Right \"white niggers\", telling jokes about rape and saying that the Jews should stop using identity politics now that the Holocaust is over.\nCarl Benjamin is an atheist.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":19},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":27},{"uri":"Video_game_journalism","surface_form":"journalist","offset":38},{"uri":"Political_correctness","surface_form":"political correctness","offset":82},{"uri":"Brexit","surface_form":"Brexit","offset":124},{"uri":"UK_Independence_Party","surface_form":"United Kingdom Independence Party","offset":146},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":201},{"uri":"YouTube","surface_form":"YouTube","offset":263},{"uri":"Sargon_of_Akkad","surface_form":"Sargon of Akkad","offset":287},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":329},{"uri":"Freedom_of_speech","surface_form":"freedom of speech","offset":361},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":402},{"uri":"Feminism","surface_form":"feminism","offset":457},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video games","offset":492},{"uri":"Richard_B._Spencer","surface_form":"Richard B.
