He is one of two people convicted in the largest lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) manufacturing case in history. In 2000, while moving their LSD laboratory across Kansas, Pickard and Clyde Apperson were pulled over by police while driving a rental truck and a follow car. He was later sentenced to serve two life sentences. The DEA has claimed that Pickard's arrest led to a 95% drop in the availability of LSD in the US in the two years after his arrest.\nIn 2015, Pickard published a book, \"The Rose of Paracelsus: On Secrets and Sacraments\".\nPickard was born in DeKalb County, Georgia. He attended Harvard University. He also lived in Mill Valley, California.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":54},{"uri":"Illegal_drug_trade","surface_form":"drug trafficker","offset":96},{"uri":"Lysergic_acid_diethylamide","surface_form":"lysergic acid diethylamide","offset":162},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":258},{"uri":"Kansas","surface_form":"Kansas","offset":276},{"uri":"Clyde_Apperson","surface_form":"Clyde Apperson","offset":296},{"uri":"Life_sentence","surface_form":"life sentence","offset":421},{"uri":"DEA","surface_form":"DEA","offset":441},{"uri":"DeKalb_County%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"DeKalb County, Georgia","offset":677},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":713},{"uri":"Mill_Valley%2C_California","surface_form":"Mill Valley, California","offset":750}]}
