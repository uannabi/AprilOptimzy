{"id":74636,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabelmann","text":"The Gabelmann (\"Fork man\") is a statue with a fountain in Bamberg, Germany. It is a Baroque statue of Neptune, the ancient Roman god of the sea, who is holding his three-pronged fork. This is why he has the name Gabelmann.\nThe Gabelmann stands in the part of the pedestrian precinct called \"Gr\u00FCner Markt\" (\"Green Market\"). In the local Franconian dialect he is called Goblmoo. There is a well-known poem about him written in the dialect.\nThe Gabelmann is a favourite place for people to meet in Bamberg.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Statue","surface_form":"statue","offset":32},{"uri":"Fountain","surface_form":"fountain","offset":46},{"uri":"Bamberg","surface_form":"Bamberg","offset":58},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":67},{"uri":"Baroque","surface_form":"Baroque","offset":84},{"uri":"Poseidon","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":102},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman","offset":123},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"god","offset":129},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":140},{"uri":"Fork","surface_form":"fork","offset":178},{"uri":"Walk","surface_form":"pedestrian","offset":263},{"uri":"Franconian_dialect","surface_form":"Franconian dialect","offset":336},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":399}]}
