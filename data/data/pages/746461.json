{"id":746461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing","text":"Social distancing, also less confusingly called physical distancing is one way to help stop the spread of infection from viruses and bacteria between people. The goal is to lower the chance for an infection to spread from person to person. This can reduce the number of infected people at one time, which lowers the burden on health care. By lowering the number of people who get sick, lives can also be saved.\nSocial distancing works for infections that are spread by droplets (cough or sneeze), physical contact, contaminated surfaces, or in the air. Social distancing does not work well for infections that are spread through food, water, or insects.\nAll of these may have negative effects on people. However, these may be preferred to the effects of a specific disease.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prophylaxis","surface_form":"stop the spread","offset":87},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":106},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":121},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":133}]}
