{"id":746838,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeebo_Sports","text":"Zeebo Sports is a series of video games for the Zeebo system that only came out in Brazil.\nThe series used to be named \"Boomerang Sports\" because the games were designed to only be used with Zeebo's \"Boomerang\" motion-sensitive controller. However, in August 2010, Zeebo released new versions of the games that can use the Boomerang or the standard Zeebo gamepad. Because of this, the series was renamed to \"Zeebo Sports\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Zeebo","surface_form":"Zeebo","offset":48}]}
