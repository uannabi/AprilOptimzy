{"id":74705,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Horse_Comics","text":"Dark Horse Comics is an American company that creates comic books and manga. It is one of the largest \"independent\" comic book publishers. The company was founded by Mike Richardson.\nRichardson is the owner of several comic book shops in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. In 1986, he began to publish an anthology series called \"Dark Horse Presents\" using money from his stores. The company is based in Milwaukie, Oregon.\nOverview.\nDark Horse creates many comics based on other peoples characters and settings. These include comics based on \"Star Wars\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Aliens\", and \"Who Wants to be a Superhero?\" Dark Horse also publishes comics by artists who own their own settings. These include Frank Miller's \"Sin City\" and \"300\", Mike Mignola's \"Hellboy\", Stan Sakai's \"Usagi Yojimbo\", Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira\" and Michael Chabon's \"The Escapist\". From 1993-1996, Dark Horse published a line of superhero comics under the name Comics Greatest World. This was later renamed Dark Horse Heroes. After 1996, publication in this line slowed greatly. They stopped making any books about the characters in the early 2000's. Today, the company does very well even though they do not have their own universe of superpowered characters.\nDark Horse's movie company, Dark Horse Entertainment, creates movies based on Dark Horse Comics. These including \"The Mask\" and \"Hellboy\".\nThe company also produces novels based on some of their more popular comic book titles, including \"Aliens\" and \"Predator\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":24},{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":33},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic book","offset":54},{"uri":"Manga","surface_form":"manga","offset":70},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishers","offset":127},{"uri":"Found","surface_form":"founded","offset":155},{"uri":"Mike_Richardson_(publisher)","surface_form":"Mike Richardson","offset":166},{"uri":"Portland%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Portland, Oregon","offset":242},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":259},{"uri":"1986","surface_form":"1986","offset":281},{"uri":"Dark_Horse_Presents","surface_form":"Dark Horse Presents","offset":335},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":362},{"uri":"Milwaukie%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Milwaukie, Oregon","offset":409},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"characters","offset":492},{"uri":"Fictional_universe","surface_form":"settings","offset":507},{"uri":"Star_Wars","surface_form":"Star Wars","offset":548},{"uri":"Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer","surface_form":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","offset":561},{"uri":"Aliens_(movie)","surface_form":"Aliens","offset":589},{"uri":"Who_Wants_to_be_a_Superhero%3F","surface_form":"Who Wants to be a Superhero?","offset":603},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":669},{"uri":"Frank_Miller_(comics)","surface_form":"Frank Miller","offset":719},{"uri":"Sin_City","surface_form":"Sin City","offset":735},{"uri":"300_(comics)","surface_form":"300","offset":750},{"uri":"Mike_Mignola","surface_form":"Mike Mignola","offset":756},{"uri":"Hellboy","surface_form":"Hellboy","offset":772},{"uri":"Stan_Sakai","surface_form":"Stan Sakai","offset":782},{"uri":"Usagi_Yojimbo","surface_form":"Usagi Yojimbo","offset":796},{"uri":"Katsuhiro_Otomo","surface_form":"Katsuhiro Otomo","offset":812},{"uri":"Akira_(manga)","surface_form":"Akira","offset":831},{"uri":"Michael_Chabon","surface_form":"Michael Chabon","offset":842},{"uri":"The_Escapist_(character)","surface_form":"The Escapist","offset":860},{"uri":"Comics_Greatest_World","surface_form":"Comics Greatest World","offset":954},{"uri":"Dark_Horse_Heroes","surface_form":"Dark Horse Heroes","offset":1000},{"uri":"Fictional_universe","surface_form":"universe","offset":1217},{"uri":"Superhero","surface_form":"superpowered characters","offset":1229},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":1267},{"uri":"Dark_Horse_Entertainment","surface_form":"Dark Horse Entertainment","offset":1282},{"uri":"The_Mask","surface_form":"The Mask","offset":1368},{"uri":"Hellboy_(movie)","surface_form":"Hellboy","offset":1383},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":1419},{"uri":"Aliens_(novel)","surface_form":"Aliens","offset":1492},{"uri":"Predator_(novel_series)","surface_form":"Predator","offset":1505}]}
