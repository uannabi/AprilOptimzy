{"id":74713,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom","text":"e=\"preserve\">A hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen.\nIts parts are a single negatively-charged electron that circles a single positively-charged nucleus of the hydrogen atom. The nucleus of hydrogen consists of only a single proton (in the case of hydrogen-1 or \"protium\"), \"or\" it may also include one or more neutrons (giving deuterium, tritium, and other isotopes). The electron is bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Hydrogen-1, also known as protium or \"light hydrogen\" is the main component of natural hydrogen.\nReferences.\nSection 4.2 deals with the hydrogen atom specifically, but all of Chapter 4 is relevant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":35},{"uri":"Hydrogen","surface_form":"hydrogen","offset":64},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":116},{"uri":"Nucleus_(physics)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":166},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":246},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":332},{"uri":"Deuterium","surface_form":"deuterium","offset":349},{"uri":"Tritium","surface_form":"tritium","offset":360},{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":379},{"uri":"Coulomb%27s_law","surface_form":"Coulomb force","offset":434},{"uri":"Component","surface_form":"component","offset":515}]}
