His business is set in Abadi\u00E2nia, Brazil, where he runs the Casa de Dom In\u00E1cio de Loyola, a \"spiritual healing center\".\nHe has had media coverage on CNN, ABC News and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". James Randi and Joe Nickell had criticized him for his healing procedures as \"nothing more than carnival tricks\" and there is no evidence that the benefits of patients are placebo effects.\nIn 2018, after over 600 people accused him of sexual abuse, he turned himself in to police. In December 2019 he was sentenced to 19 years and four months for the rapes of four different women. On January 20, 2020, Faria was sentenced to another 40 years in prison for rape against 5 women. The sentences add up to 63 years and 4 months.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["criminal"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medium_(spirituality)","surface_form":"medium","offset":102},{"uri":"Psychic_surgery","surface_form":"psychic surgeon","offset":111},{"uri":"Sex_offender","surface_form":"sex offender","offset":142},{"uri":"Abadi%C3%A2nia","surface_form":"Abadi\u00E2nia","offset":179},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":190},{"uri":"CNN","surface_form":"CNN","offset":305},{"uri":"ABC_News","surface_form":"ABC News","offset":310},{"uri":"The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show","surface_form":"The Oprah Winfrey Show","offset":324},{"uri":"James_Randi","surface_form":"James Randi","offset":349},{"uri":"Joe_Nickell","surface_form":"Joe Nickell","offset":365},{"uri":"Placebo","surface_form":"placebo effects","offset":521}]}
