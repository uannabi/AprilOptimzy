{"id":747660,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian","text":"e=\"preserve\">The steradian (symbol: sr) or square radian is an SI unit. It is like a radian, but for smooth 3D objects, for example, a sphere. A steradian is about one twelfth the surface area of a sphere, regardless of how big the sphere is.\nSphere vs Steradian.\nSo a sphere measures 4\u03C0 steradians, or about 12.57 steradians. Likewise a steradian is 1/12.57, or about 8% of a sphere. And because we measure an angle, it doesn't matter what size the sphere is, it will always measure 4\u03C0 steradians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"SI unit","offset":63},{"uri":"Radian","surface_form":"radian","offset":85},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D","offset":108},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":135}]}
