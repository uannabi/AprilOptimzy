The \"Globe\"<nowiki/>'s coverage encouraged other victims to come forward with allegations of abuse, resulting in numerous lawsuits and more criminal cases.\nLater investigations and allegations revealed a pattern of sexual abuse and cover-ups in a number of large dioceses across the United States.\nThe investigation of the scandal by \"The Boston Globe\" was titled \"Spotlight Investigation: Abuse in the Catholic Church\". Its reporting was made into a \"movie\" in 2015, which won two Academy Awards including Best Picture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":92},{"uri":"Sexual_abuse","surface_form":"sexual abuse","offset":108},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":190},{"uri":"The_Boston_Globe","surface_form":"\"The\" \"Boston Globe\"","offset":228},{"uri":"Spotlight_(movie)","surface_form":"movie","offset":980},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":1010},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture","surface_form":"Best Picture","offset":1035}]}
