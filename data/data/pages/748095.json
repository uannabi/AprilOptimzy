{"id":748095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Sleeper","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lonnie David Franklin Jr. (August 30, 1952 \u2013 March 28, 2020), better known by the nickname Grim Sleeper, was a convicted American serial killer. He was responsible for at least ten murders and one attempted murder in Los Angeles, California. He was also convicted for rape and sexual violence. Franklin earned his nickname when he appeared to have taken a 14-year break from his crimes, from 1988 to 2002.\nIn July 2010, Franklin was arrested as a suspect, and, after many delays, his trial began in February 2016. On May 5, 2016, the jury convicted him of killing nine women and one teenage girl.\nOn June 6, 2016, the jury recommended the death penalty, and on August 10, 2016, the Los Angeles Superior Court sentenced him to death. On March 28, 2020, he was found unresponsive in his cell at San Quentin and pronounced dead at the age of 67.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Serial_killer","surface_form":"serial killer","offset":143},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":230},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":281},{"uri":"Sexual_violence","surface_form":"sexual violence","offset":290},{"uri":"Death_penalty","surface_form":"death penalty","offset":652},{"uri":"San_Quentin","surface_form":"San Quentin","offset":806}]}
