Patrick calls him and makes noises with his tongue. When Patrick stops, SpongeBob checks the dryer and finds out his pants have shrunk. A mall worker tells him that square pants will not be shipped in months. SpongeBob then looks around the mall for a different type of pants. He ends up finding a pair of round pants and decides to buy them. SpongeBob later meets Patrick, who does not recognize him in his round pants. Sandy and Squidward pretend to not recognize him either. Patrick won't let SpongeBob in his house because he says the house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants.\nSpongeBob thinks no one will recognize him in his round pants, so he goes to the Krusty Krab to get hired again. Mr. Krabs does not pretend to not recognize SpongeBob and tells him to get to work. Squidward shows SpongeBob how to be a bad worker without telling him in hopes of getting him fired. Mr. Krabs catches Squidward and SpongeBob sleeping on the job and gets mad. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he can not be \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" because of his round pants. Mr. Krabs tells him to just take off his round pants, leaving him in his underwear. Sandy teases SpongeBob by calling him \"SpongeBob UnderPants,\" making him scream and ending the episode.\nFeedback.\nPaul Mavis of DVD Talk gave a positive response and says that \"There are laughs in 'To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants.'\" Judge Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict gave the episode a score of 5 out of 10 and said that \"[the episode] was one of the slighter entries [on the DVD] with the core joke being fairly well-handled with no one recognizing SpongeBob, but it went on just a little too long.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SpongeBob_SquarePants_(season_6)","surface_form":"sixth season","offset":90},{"uri":"SpongeBob_SquarePants","surface_form":"SpongeBob SquarePants","offset":107},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":153},{"uri":"Television_marathon","surface_form":"television marathon","offset":198},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":272},{"uri":"Narrator","surface_form":"narrator","offset":374},{"uri":"SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)","surface_form":"SpongeBob","offset":404},{"uri":"Clothes_dryer","surface_form":"dryer","offset":492},{"uri":"Patrick_Star","surface_form":"Patrick","offset":499},{"uri":"Shipping","surface_form":"shipped","offset":689},{"uri":"Sandy_Cheeks","surface_form":"Sandy","offset":920},{"uri":"Squidward_Tentacles","surface_form":"Squidward","offset":930},{"uri":"Krusty_Krab","surface_form":"Krusty Krab","offset":1159},{"uri":"Employment","surface_form":"hired","offset":1178},{"uri":"Mr._Krabs","surface_form":"Mr. Krabs","offset":1191},{"uri":"Firing","surface_form":"fired","offset":1368},{"uri":"Underwear","surface_form":"underwear","offset":1621},{"uri":"DVD_Talk","surface_form":"DVD Talk","offset":1760},{"uri":"DVD_Verdict","surface_form":"DVD Verdict","offset":1895}]}
