{"id":748461,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_silk","text":"=\"preserve\">Most spiders can produce a natural fibre which they use for different purposes. This fibre is called spider silk. Depending on the type of spider, spider silk is uses for purposes of catching prey (either by weaving a net, or by throwing a sticky thread at prey), to get away from predators, and to protect the eggs and the young in a cocoon. Spider silk is very resistant, and has a high tensile strength, it does not tear easily.\nUnlike the silk from silkworms, spider silk cannot be produced in large quantities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spider","surface_form":"spiders","offset":17},{"uri":"Fibre","surface_form":"fibre","offset":47},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"silk","offset":455},{"uri":"Silkworm","surface_form":"silkworms","offset":465}]}
