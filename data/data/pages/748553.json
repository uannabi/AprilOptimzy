{"id":748553,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_orbit","text":"=\"preserve\">In astronomy, an elliptical orbit refers to an object (such as a planet or star) which orbits around a central body in an elliptical motion. This motion follows Kepler's Laws. An elliptical orbit occurs when the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0, and less than 1.\nThe Moon moves around the Earth in an elliptical orbit, and the planets move around the Sun in an elliptical orbit.\nOther types of motion in astronomy include circular orbit, parabolic trajectory, and hyperbolic trajectory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":15},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":77},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":87},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbits","offset":99},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":134},{"uri":"Kepler%27s_Laws","surface_form":"Kepler's Laws","offset":173},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":191},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":202},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":224},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":244},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":290},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":312},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":324},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":335},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planets","offset":350},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":374},{"uri":"Ellipse","surface_form":"elliptical","offset":384},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":395},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":427},{"uri":"Circular_orbit","surface_form":"circular orbit","offset":445},{"uri":"Parabolic_trajectory","surface_form":"parabolic trajectory","offset":461},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_trajectory","surface_form":"hyperbolic trajectory","offset":487}]}
