{"id":748556,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trajectory","text":"=\"preserve\">In astronomy, a parabolic trajectory (also known as parabolic orbit or parabolic escape trajectory) refers to an object (such as an asteroid) which follows a path similar to a parabola around another object. This motion follows Kepler's Laws. A parabolic trajectory occurs when the eccentricity of its orbit is equal to 1.\nOther types of motion in astronomy include circular orbit, elliptical orbit, and hyperbolic trajectory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":15},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":74},{"uri":"Escape_velocity","surface_form":"escape trajectory","offset":93},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":144},{"uri":"Parabola","surface_form":"parabola","offset":188},{"uri":"Kepler%27s_Laws","surface_form":"Kepler's Laws","offset":240},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":294},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":360},{"uri":"Circular_orbit","surface_form":"circular orbit","offset":378},{"uri":"Elliptical_orbit","surface_form":"elliptical orbit","offset":394},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_trajectory","surface_form":"hyperbolic trajectory","offset":416}]}
