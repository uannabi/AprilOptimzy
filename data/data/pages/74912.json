He began working for Schuhbeck, and Sebastian Schubeck later adopted Alfons, and made him his heir.\nAlfons quickly became a very good chef. The village inn he worked at soon became a favourite restaurant of the richer people of Munich and Salzburg.\nHe did more training in Salzburg, Geneva, Paris, London and Munich as well as Feinkost K\u00E4fer, Dallmayr and in the \"Restaurant Aubergine\" of Eckart Witzigmann. He also studied at the College of Hotel Management in Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria. He finally took over the Kurhausst\u00FCberl in Waging in 1980.\nIn 1983 he got a star in the Michelin Guide. The Gault Millau restaurant guide gave him 17 points and in 1989 he was elected cook of the year.\nSince 1990 Schubeck has operated an outside catering service, which has catered for many high-class events like the Federal Chancellor\u2019s celebration, the Ball des Sports and the German music industry\u2019s \"ECHO\" award ceremony.\nIn 2003 he opened a new restaurant, the \"S\u00FCdtiroler Stuben\" at the Platzl in Munich.
