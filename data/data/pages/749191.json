{"id":749191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validated_numerics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Validated numerics (or reliable computation) is a numerical analysis with mathematically strict error evaluation. In order to do so, a technology called interval arithmetic is used. Validated numerics is needed for the following reasons.\nOne of the most known implementation of validated numerics is INTLAB (Interval Laboratory). INTLAB was used to create other numerical libraries, and it was also used to solve the Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical analysis","offset":63},{"uri":"Interval_arithmetic","surface_form":"interval arithmetic","offset":166},{"uri":"INTLAB","surface_form":"INTLAB","offset":313}]}
