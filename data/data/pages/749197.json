He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nOn September 9, 1977, Maddux disappeared following a trip to collect her belongings from the apartment she and Einhorn had shared in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eighteen months later, police found her partially mummified body in a trunk in Einhorn's closet.\nAfter his arrest, Einhorn fled the country and spent twenty-three years in Europe before being taken back to the United States. He said that his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research.\nHe was convicted and served a life sentence at a prison in Pennsylvania until his death in prison in April 2020 of heart disease, aged 79.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":169},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":183},{"uri":"Philadelphia","surface_form":"Philadelphia","offset":330},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":344},{"uri":"Mummification","surface_form":"mummified","offset":408},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":530},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":568},{"uri":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","surface_form":"CIA","offset":633},{"uri":"Life_imprisonment","surface_form":"life sentence","offset":777},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":806},{"uri":"Heart_disease","surface_form":"heart disease","offset":862}]}
