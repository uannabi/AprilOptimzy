It can be found in the Afrikaans, Catalan, Danish, Emilian-Romagnol, French, Galician, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Kashubian, Luxembourgish, Occitan, Norwegian, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese, and Welsh languages. In the English language, it can be found in loanwards (for example, \"r\u00E9sum\u00E9\" and \"clich\u00E9\") and romanizations (for example, \"Pok\u00E9mon\").\nCzech and Slovak.\n\u00C9 is the 9th letter of the Czech alphabet and the Slovak alphabet. In the IPA, it represents /\u025B\u02D0/ in these languages.\nDanish, Norwegian, and Swedish.\nIn the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish languages, the letter \u00C9 is used to show that the regular letter E is stressed. It is used to change the meaning of a word.\nDutch.\n\u00C9 is found in foreign words, mostly from French. It is also used to tell apart the Dutch words \"een\" (meaning \"a\" or \"an\" in English) and \"\u00E9\u00E9n\" (meaning the number one in English). It adds stress in the same way English sometimes uses italics. In Dutch, some people may use the Dutch word \"h\u00E9\" to greet eachother, meaning \"hey\" or \"hi\".\nEmilian-Romagnol.\nIn Emilian, \u00E9 is used as [e] in IPA (for example, \"r\u00E9cc\", meaning \"rich\" in English). In Romagnol, \u00E9 is used as [e\u02D0] (for example, \"l\u00E9dar\", meaning \"thieves\" in English).\nEnglish.\nThe letter \u00C9 appears in words that came from the French language. For example, n\u00E9e, r\u00E9sum\u00E9, fianc\u00E9e, saut\u00E9, and coup\u00E9. It is also used in names, such as Beyonc\u00E9, Brene\u00E9, JonBen\u00E9t, and Th\u00E9o.\nFrench.\nThe letter \u00C9 is widely used in French. It is pronounced as /e/ in IPA.

It is only used in the last letter of a word (except when a different may change the meaning of a word). For example, \"perch\u00E9\" (meaning \"why\" or \"because\" in English) and \"p\u00E9sca\" (which means \"fishing\" in English). The letter \u00C8 is also in the Italian alphabet, which is the letter E with a grave accent. Instead of /e/, the letter \u00C8 is used as /\u025B/ in IPA.\nKashubian.\n\u00C9 is the 8th letter of the Kashubian alphabet and is used as /\u025B/ in IPA.\nPortuguese.\n\u00C9 is used to stress an /\u025B/ when the stressed syllable is not known that well (for example, \"p\u00E9ssimo\", meaning \"very bad\" in English). \u00C9 can also mean the word \"is\", as in \"ela \u00E9 bonita\" (meaning \"she is pretty\" in English). Another letter in Portuguese, the letter \u00CA, uses /e/. \u00CA is the letter E with a circumflex.\nSpanish.\nThe letter \u00E9 is pronounced the same as e (/e/). The accent marks the letter with a stressed syllable in words that do not usually have stress, such as \"\u00E9xtasis\" and \"beb\u00E9\".\nScottish Gaelic.\nThe letter \u00C9 used to be used in the Scottish Gaelic language, but it has been replaced with the letter \u00C8, an E with a grave accent.\nWelsh.\nThe letter \u00C9 is used to put stress on a short vowel. For example, \"person\u00E9l\" (meaning \"personnel\" in English), \"sigar\u00E9t\" (meaning \"cigarette\" in English), and \"ymbar\u00E9l\" (meaning \"umbrella\" in English).\nVietnamese.\nThe letter \u00C9 indicates a rising tone in Vietnamese. It can also be combined with a circumflex to make the letter \"\u1EBE\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Regularly","surface_form":"regularly","offset":31},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":54},{"uri":"E","surface_form":"E","offset":89},{"uri":"Acute_accent","surface_form":"acute accent","offset":99},{"uri":"Afrikaans_language","surface_form":"Afrikaans","offset":145},{"uri":"Catalan_language","surface_form":"Catalan","offset":156},{"uri":"Danish_language","surface_form":"Danish","offset":165},{"uri":"Emilian-Romagnol_language","surface_form":"Emilian-Romagnol","offset":173},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":191},{"uri":"Galician_language","surface_form":"Galician","offset":199},{"uri":"Hungarian_language","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":209},{"uri":"Icelandic_language","surface_form":"Icelandic","offset":220},{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":231},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":238},{"uri":"Kashubian_language","surface_form":"Kashubian","offset":247},{"uri":"Luxembourgish_language","surface_form":"Luxembourgish","offset":258},{"uri":"Occitan_language","surface_form":"Occitan","offset":273},{"uri":"Norwegian_language","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":282},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":293},{"uri":"Slovak_language","surface_form":"Slovak","offset":305},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":313},{"uri":"Swedish_language","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":322},{"uri":"Vietnamese_language","surface_form":"Vietnamese","offset":331},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":347},{"uri":"Loanword","surface_form":"loanwards","offset":408},{"uri":"Resume","surface_form":"r\u00E9sum\u00E9","offset":433},{"uri":"Clich%C3%A9","surface_form":"clich\u00E9","offset":446},{"uri":"Romanization","surface_form":"romanizations","offset":459},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":488},{"uri":"Czech_alphabet","surface_form":"Czech alphabet","offset":544},{"uri":"Slovak_alphabet","surface_form":"Slovak alphabet","offset":567},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"IPA","offset":591},{"uri":"Stress_(linguistics)","surface_form":"stressed","offset":773},{"uri":"Foreign","surface_form":"foreign","offset":848},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":875},{"uri":"One","surface_form":"one","offset":998},{"uri":"Italic","surface_form":"italics","offset":1069},{"uri":"Greet","surface_form":"greet","offset":1131},{"uri":"Emilian_dialiect","surface_form":"Emilian","offset":1192},{"uri":"Romagnol_dialect","surface_form":"Romagnol","offset":1278},{"uri":"N%C3%A9e","surface_form":"n\u00E9e","offset":1448},{"uri":"Resume","surface_form":"r\u00E9sum\u00E9","offset":1453},{"uri":"Fianc%C3%A9e","surface_form":"fianc\u00E9e","offset":1461},{"uri":"Saut%C3%A9","surface_form":"saut\u00E9","offset":1470},{"uri":"Coup%C3%A9","surface_form":"coup\u00E9","offset":1481},{"uri":"Beyonc%C3%A9","surface_form":"Beyonc\u00E9","offset":1522},{"uri":"JonBen%C3%A9t","surface_form":"JonBen\u00E9t","offset":1539},{"uri":"Widely","surface_form":"widely","offset":1583},{"uri":"Pronounce","surface_form":"pronounced","offset":1612},{"uri":"%C3%88","surface_form":"\u00C8","offset":1661},{"uri":"Hungarian_alphabet","surface_form":"Hungarian alphabet","offset":1789},{"uri":"Icelandic_alphabet","surface_form":"Icelandic alphabet","offset":1874},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":1973},{"uri":"Vowel_length","surface_form":"long vowel","offset":1984},{"uri":"Stress_(linguistics)","surface_form":"tonic accent","offset":2072},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":2279},{"uri":"%C3%88","surface_form":"\u00C8","offset":2312},{"uri":"Grave_accent","surface_form":"grave accent","offset":2376},{"uri":"Kashubian_alphabet","surface_form":"Kashubian alphabet","offset":2480},{"uri":"%C3%8A","surface_form":"\u00CA","offset":2803},{"uri":"Circumflex","surface_form":"circumflex","offset":2841},{"uri":"%C3%88","surface_form":"\u00C8","offset":3155},{"uri":"Grave_accent","surface_form":"grave accent","offset":3170},{"uri":"Vowel_length","surface_form":"short vowel","offset":3231},{"uri":"Personnel","surface_form":"personnel","offset":3278},{"uri":"Cigarette","surface_form":"cigarette","offset":3322},{"uri":"Umbrella","surface_form":"umbrella","offset":3370},{"uri":"Rising_tone","surface_form":"rising tone","offset":3430},{"uri":"Circumflex","surface_form":"circumflex","offset":3488}]}
