It is held once in 2 years.\nPrizes.\nAt each SCAN, the R. E. Moore Prize will be given. This is a prize for researchers in the field of validated numerics, and the name of the prize came from Ramon E. Moore, one of the greatest expert of interval arithmetic (an important technology for validated numerics).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical analysis","offset":165},{"uri":"Numerical_integration","surface_form":"numerical integration","offset":193},{"uri":"Numerical_linear_algebra","surface_form":"numerical linear algebra","offset":216},{"uri":"Numerical_methods_for_partial_differential_equations","surface_form":"numerical methods for partial differential equations","offset":242},{"uri":"Interval_arithmetic","surface_form":"interval arithmetic","offset":296},{"uri":"Validated_numerics","surface_form":"validated numerics","offset":320},{"uri":"Validated_numerics","surface_form":"validated numerics","offset":481}]}
