It has a capacity of 100,000. It was used as the main stadium for the 1956 Summer Olympics.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club started to use the area for cricket in 1853. Their old ground, now Southbank, was often flooded by the Yarra River, and was also in the way of a new railway line. In 1859, the first game of Australian Rules Football was played at the ground.\nThe MCG is run by a trust. The first chairman of the trust was the first Premier of Victoria, William Haines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":40},{"uri":"Australian_Rules_Football","surface_form":"Australian Rules Football","offset":52},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":89},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":100},{"uri":"1956_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1956 Summer Olympics","offset":181},{"uri":"Southbank","surface_form":"Southbank","offset":297},{"uri":"Yarra_River","surface_form":"Yarra River","offset":333},{"uri":"Premier_of_Victoria","surface_form":"Premier of Victoria","offset":545},{"uri":"William_Haines_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"William Haines","offset":566}]}
