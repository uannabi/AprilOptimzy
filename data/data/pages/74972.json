{"id":74972,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ab\u016B \u1E6C\u0101lib ibn \u2018Abd al-Mu\u1E6D\u1E6Dalib (; \u2013), \"n\u00E9\" \u2018Imran) or \u2018Abd Manaf (), was the leader of Banu Hashim, a clan of the Qurayshi tribe of Mecca in the Hejaz, Arabian Peninsula. After the death of his father \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, he got this position and the offices of \"Siqaya\" and \"Rifada\". He was well respected in Mecca even though he was not very rich.\nAbu Talib was an uncle of the Islamic \"Nabi\" (, Prophet) Muhammad, and father of the Rashid Caliph \u2018Ali, who is also thought as the first Shi'ite Imam. There is a great debate among Muslim scholars on whether Ab\u016B \u1E6C\u0101lib died a Muslim or a non-Muslim.\nAb\u016B \u1E6C\u0101lib died around 619, at more than 80 years of age, about 10 years after the start of Muhammad's mission. This year is known as the Year of Sorrow for Muhammad, because not only did his uncle Abu Talib die, but also his wife Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, within a month of Abu Talib.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"N%C3%A9","surface_form":"n\u00E9","offset":52},{"uri":"Banu_Hashim","surface_form":"Banu Hashim","offset":100},{"uri":"Quraysh","surface_form":"Qurayshi tribe","offset":127},{"uri":"Mecca","surface_form":"Mecca","offset":145},{"uri":"Hejaz","surface_form":"Hejaz","offset":158},{"uri":"Arabian_Peninsula","surface_form":"Arabian Peninsula","offset":165},{"uri":"Abd_al-Muttalib","surface_form":"Abd al-Muttalib","offset":215},{"uri":"Prophets_of_Islam","surface_form":"Islamic \"Nabi\"","offset":390},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"Prophet","offset":408},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":417},{"uri":"Rashidun_Empire","surface_form":"Rashid Caliph","offset":445},{"uri":"Ali","surface_form":"Ali","offset":460},{"uri":"Shia_Islam","surface_form":"Shi'ite","offset":498},{"uri":"Imam","surface_form":"Imam","offset":506},{"uri":"Year_of_Sorrow","surface_form":"Year of Sorrow","offset":747},{"uri":"Khadijah_bint_Khuwaylid","surface_form":"Khadijah bint Khuwaylid","offset":840}]}
