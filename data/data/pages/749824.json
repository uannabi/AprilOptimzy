He served as Chief Adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson from July 2019 until November 13 2020. He was also special adviser to Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education from 2010 to 2014.\nFrom 2015 to 2016, Cummings was director of the successful Vote Leave campaign. It was an organisation against the continued British membership of the European Union. The group took an active part in the 2016 referendum campaign for Brexit.\nCummings was born in Durham. He is married to Mary Wakefield. The couple have one son. Sir John Laws, a Lord Justice of Appeal, was Cummings' uncle.\nIn May 2020, many people wanted Cummings to quit because he visited his parent's farm in Durham. Durham is over from his home in London. At the time, he had symptoms of COVID-19, and rules in the UK during the pandemic said people who thought they had the virus should stay at home. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Cummings had done nothing wrong and had a reason to go against the rules, because he needed childcare for his child. The Durham Constabulary started an investigation to see if Cummings had broken the law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_people","surface_form":"British","offset":55},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":115},{"uri":"Boris_Johnson","surface_form":"Boris Johnson","offset":130},{"uri":"Michael_Gove","surface_form":"Michael Gove","offset":214},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State_for_Education","surface_form":"Secretary of State for Education","offset":232},{"uri":"Vote_Leave","surface_form":"Vote Leave","offset":343},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":435},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum","surface_form":"2016 referendum campaign","offset":488},{"uri":"Brexit","surface_form":"Brexit","offset":517},{"uri":"Durham","surface_form":"Durham","offset":546},{"uri":"John_Laws_(judge)","surface_form":"Sir John Laws","offset":612},{"uri":"Court_of_Appeal_judge_(England_and_Wales)","surface_form":"Lord Justice of Appeal","offset":629},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":755},{"uri":"Durham","surface_form":"Durham","offset":763},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":803},{"uri":"COVID-19","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":843},{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"pandemic","offset":884},{"uri":"Boris_Johnson","surface_form":"Boris Johnson","offset":972},{"uri":"Childcare","surface_form":"childcare","offset":1088},{"uri":"Durham_Constabulary","surface_form":"Durham Constabulary","offset":1117}]}
