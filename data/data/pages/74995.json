{"id":74995,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saman%C3%A1_Bay","text":"Saman\u00E1 Bay (Spanish, Bah\u00EDa de Saman\u00E1) is a big bay in the northeast of the Dominican Republic, south of the Saman\u00E1 Peninsula. Christopher Columbus gave the name of \"Golfo de las Flechas\" (Gulf of Arrows) to the bay.\nIt has about east-west and north-south. The Yuna river, one of the most important of the Hispaniola island, flows into the bay. Other rivers that flow into the bay are the Barracote and the Yab\u00F3n.\nThere are many cays (very small and flat islands) in the bay, many of them with beautiful beaches visited by many tourists; Levantado Cay (Spanish, Cayo Levantado) is big enough to have a hotel.\nOn the southwest coast there is a national park: National Park Los Haitises, with many interesting plants and animals.\nDolphins are common in the bay most of the year. Humpback whales come from northern, cold waters to Saman\u00E1 Bay to breed during winter and spring; then, they return to cold waters where food is more abundant. Whale watching is an important business in the Saman\u00E1 Province in late winter and early spring.\nFrance, England and United States were interested in the Saman\u00E1 Bay (with the Saman\u00E1 Peninsula) during the 19th century to control the Caribbean. Before that time, pirates were frequent visitors.\nThe most important cities around the bay are Santa B\u00E1rbara de Saman\u00E1 and S\u00E1nchez on the north, in the Saman\u00E1 Province province; and Sabana de la Mar, on the south, in the Hato Mayor Province province. S\u00E1nchez was the most important international port of the Dominican Republic during the 19th century and early 20th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Headlands_and_bays","surface_form":"bay","offset":47},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":75},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":126},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":265},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":305},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":316},{"uri":"Cay","surface_form":"cay","offset":428},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourists","offset":527},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":642},{"uri":"Dolphin","surface_form":"Dolphin","offset":727},{"uri":"Humpback_Whale","surface_form":"Humpback whales","offset":776},{"uri":"Santa_B%C3%A1rbara_de_Saman%C3%A1","surface_form":"Santa B\u00E1rbara de Saman\u00E1","offset":1272},{"uri":"S%C3%A1nchez%2C_Saman%C3%A1","surface_form":"S\u00E1nchez","offset":1300},{"uri":"Saman%C3%A1_Province","surface_form":"Saman\u00E1 Province","offset":1329},{"uri":"Hato_Mayor_Province","surface_form":"Hato Mayor Province","offset":1398}]}
