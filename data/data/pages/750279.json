The KGB spy Cameron Smith (Charles Martin Smith) takes them to the Soviet Union, as \"experts\" on the \"American lifestyle\" with the intention of teaching KGB spies to be like Americans. And under the influence of drugs they think they have arrived in \"Nebraska\" to open the nightclub.

KGB spies go there to study \"American people\" and \"American culture\", but is stuck in the 1950s. The KGB spy Smith is in charge of the \"typical American town\" built for espionage-training purposes and hopes that his fellow spies will learn real American culture. But things get out of control when Travis and Wendell introduce their fellow \"American\" neighbors current pop culture, turn a bar into a rock music club and teach the townsfolk to dance. Both also flirt with local women.\nTravis and Wendell increasingly become suspicious, but when they get lost in a forest and stumble upon a military base where everyone is speaking Russian, they realize that they are actually in the Soviet Union. Things also get dangerous when the townsfolk taste freedom, and the KGB decides to stop the experiment and kill the American \"guests\", who have to find ways to flee the country.\nReception.\n\"The Experts\" did very badly at the box office (it was a massive \"box office bomb\"); its budget was estimated at $3 million and the box office was only $169,203.
