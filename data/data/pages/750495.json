They had been together for three years when they co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco in 1955. It was the first social and political organization for lesbians in the United States.\nThey both acted as president and editor of \"The Ladder\" until 1963, and remained involved in the DOB until joining the National Organization for Women (NOW) as the first lesbian couple to do so.\nThey were married on February 12, 2004, in the first same-sex wedding to take place in San Francisco after Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered the city clerk to begin providing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, that marriage was voided by the California Supreme Court on August 12, 2004.\nThey married again on June 16, 2008, in the first same-sex wedding to take place in San Francisco after the California Supreme Court's decision in \"In re Marriage Cases\" legalized same-sex marriage in California.\nMartin was born in San Francisco. She died there of problems caused by a fall at the age of 87 in 2008.\nLyon was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
