{"id":750498,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_Bilitis","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Daughters of Bilitis, also called the DOB or the Daughters, was the first lesbian civil and political rights organization in the United States.\nThe organization, formed in San Francisco in 1955 by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, was created to be another hangout area for lesbians other than lesbian bars. This was to avoid raids and police harassment. It later gave support to women who were afraid to come out.\nThe DOB educated them about their rights, and about gay history.\nThe Daughters of Bilitis lasted for 14 years, becoming an educational resource for lesbians, gay men, researchers and mental health professionals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":91},{"uri":"Civil_and_political_rights","surface_form":"civil and political rights","offset":99},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":189},{"uri":"Del_Martin_and_Phyllis_Lyon","surface_form":"Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon","offset":214},{"uri":"Lesbian_bar","surface_form":"lesbian bar","offset":306},{"uri":"Police_raid","surface_form":"raids","offset":338},{"uri":"Police_harassment","surface_form":"police harassment","offset":348},{"uri":"Coming_out","surface_form":"come out","offset":417},{"uri":"Gay_history","surface_form":"gay history","offset":479}]}
