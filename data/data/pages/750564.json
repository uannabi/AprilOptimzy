Its capital is Barda\u00EF.\nIt was created in 2008 when the former Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region was split into three. The Tibesti Department became the Tibesti Region. The region is named for the Tibesti Mountains, one of the most prominent mountain chains in the Sahara Desert.\nThe area fell under French rule during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century. Prior to 1931 much of the region belonged to what is now Niger, as part of the French West Africa colony.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chad","surface_form":"Chad","offset":30},{"uri":"Barda%C3%AF%2C_Chad","surface_form":"Barda\u00EF","offset":51},{"uri":"Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti_Region","surface_form":"Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region","offset":98},{"uri":"Tibesti_Department","surface_form":"Tibesti Department","offset":153},{"uri":"Tibesti_Mountains","surface_form":"Tibesti Mountains","offset":227},{"uri":"Sahara_Desert","surface_form":"Sahara Desert","offset":295},{"uri":"Scramble_for_Africa","surface_form":"Scramble for Africa","offset":353},{"uri":"French_West_Africa","surface_form":"French West Africa","offset":478}]}
