{"id":750572,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church","text":"The Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) is a confessional Presbyterian denomination located primarily in the northern United States. It was founded by conservative members of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America(PCUSA) who strongly objected to the Modernist theology during the 1930s. It has had an influence on evangelicalism far beyond its size.\nHistory.\nThe Orthodox Presbyterian Church was founded in 1936, largely through the efforts of John Gresham Machen. Machen and others had founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, in response to a re-organization of Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1933, Machen, concerned about Liberal Christianity|liberal theology tolerated by Presbyterians on the mission field, formed the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. The next Presbyterian General Assembly reaffirmed that Independent Board was unconstitutional and gave the associated clergy an ultimatum to break their links. When Machen and seven other clergy refused, they were suspended from the Presbyterian ministry.\nOn June 11, 1936, Machen and a group of conservative ministers, elders, and laymen met in Philadelphia to form the Presbyterian Church of America (not to be confused with the Presbyterian Church in America, or PCA, which came about decades later). Machen was elected as the first moderator. The PCUSA filed suit against the fledgling denomination for its choice of name, and in 1939, the denomination adopted its current name, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.\nMachen died in January 1937. Later that year, a significant faction of the OPC, led by Carl McIntire, broke away to form the Bible Presbyterian Church, a denomination which, unlike the OPC, required abstinence from alcohol and taught premillennialism.\nCongregations.\nAs of 2014, The OPC had 281 congregations. In 2019, Escondido Orthodox Presbyterian Church received media attention as the church of which John Earnest, alleged perpetrator of the 2019 Poway synagogue shooting|Poway synagogue shooting, was a member. Its pastor, Zake Keele, condemned the shooting as an \"act of evil.\"\nDoctrine.\nThe OPC system of doctrine is the Reformed faith, also called Calvinism. Calvin's doctrines continued to develop after his death, and a particular evolution of them was set forth by a 17th-century assembly of British theologians in the Westminster Standards (which include the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger Catechism|Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechism|Shorter Catechism<nowiki/>s). The OPC holds to the Westminster Standards with the American revisions of 1788.\nFile:John Calvin - Young.jpg|thumb|French theologian ohn Calvin was one of the theologians influential in the early years of the Reformed family of Protestantism\nOPC pastors and presbyteries teach a range of doctrines based on the historical view of the biblical creation accounts, from framework and analogical interpretations to young earth.\nAmerican politics.\nThe 39th General Assembly, meeting in 1972, adopted a statement on abortion that included the affirmation that \"voluntary abortion, except possibly to save the physical life of the mother, is in violation of the Sixth Commandment (Exodus 20:13).\"\nIn 1993, the denomination petitioned then President Bill Clinton to continue to disallow homosexuals to serve in the military. According to the petition, \"homosexuality is a reproach to any nation. It undermines the family, and poses a substantial threat to the general health, safety and welfare of our citizens.\" The petition claims that AIDS and \"other diseases\" are spread particularly through homosexual conduct.\nThe 68th General Assembly declared that women serving in combat positions in the military is contrary to the Bible.\nIn 2006-2007, a study committee formed by the General Assembly created a report that concluded that \"the church should never turn its back on fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, whether they are legally or illegally in the country. We should be willing to see to the spiritual and physical needs of anyone who comes to the church.\" The report also recommended that illegal immigrants seek to \"repent\" of their legal status.\nOPC ministers have held a variety of political views. Carl Trueman, an ordained minister in the OPC, has authored \"Republocrat: Confessions of a Liberal Conservative\" (pub. 2010). Several founders of American Christian Reconstructionism (such as Rousas John Rushdoony and Greg Bahnsen) were Orthodox Presbyterian ministers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reformed_faith","surface_form":"Reformed faith","offset":2151},{"uri":"Ohn_Calvin","surface_form":"ohn Calvin","offset":2667},{"uri":"Framework_interpretation_(Genesis)","surface_form":"framework","offset":2901},{"uri":"Young_Earth_creationism","surface_form":"young earth","offset":2945},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":3276}]}
