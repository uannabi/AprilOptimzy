She was head of the Neoplatonic School in Alexandria, Egypt, from the year 400. Her students were young men from around the empire.\n1678 Elena Cornaro Piscopia became to receive an academic degree from a university, and the first to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree. She went on to be a lecturer at the University of Padua in mathematics..\n19th Century.\n1827: French mathematician Sophie Germain saw her theorem, known as Germain's Theorem, published in a footnote of a book by the mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre. In this theorem Germain proved that if \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" are integers and if \"x\"5\u00A0+\u00A0\"y\"5\u00A0=\u00A0\"z\"5 then either \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\" must be divisible by\u00A05. Germain's theorem was a major step toward proving Fermat's last theorem for the case where n equals 5.\n1829: The first public examination of an American girl in geometry was held.\n1874: Russian mathematician Sofya Kovalevskaya became the first woman in modern Europe to gain a doctorate in mathematics, which she earned from the University of G\u00F6ttingen in Germany.\n1888: The Kovalevskaya top, one of a brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion, was discovered by Sofya Kovalevskaya.\n1889: Sofya Kovalevskaya was appointed as the first female professor in Northern Europe, at the University of Stockholm.\n20th Century.\n1918: German mathematician Emmy Noether published Noether's (first) theorem.\n1927: American mathematician Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler became the first woman to present a lecture at the American Mathematical Society Colloquium.\n1930: Cecilia Krieger became the first woman to earn a PhD in mathematics in Canada, at the University of Toronto.\n1956: American mathematician Gladys West began collecting data from satellites at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division. Her calculations directly impacted the development of accurate GPS systems.\n1960 and 1966: Lucy Joan Slater published two books about mathematical functions from the Cambridge University Press, one of the world's largest academic publisher.\n1980s.\n1983: Julia Robinson became the first female president of the American Mathematical Society.\n1990s.\n1995: American mathematician Margaret H. Wright became the first female president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.\n1998: Melanie Wood became the first female American to make the U.S. International Mathematical Olympiad Team. She won silver medals in the 1998 and 1999 International Mathematical Olympiads.\n2000s.\n2004: American Alison Miller became the first ever female gold medal winner on the U.S. International Mathematical Olympiad Team.\n2010s.\n2016: The London Mathematical Society's Women in Mathematics Committee was awarded the Royal Society's inaugural [https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/athena-prize/ Athena Prize].\n2019: American mathematician Karen Uhlenbeck became the first woman to win the Abel Prize.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hypatia","surface_form":"Hypatia","offset":122},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":179},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"academic degree","offset":422},{"uri":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Doctor of Philosophy","offset":484},{"uri":"University_of_Padua","surface_form":"University of Padua","offset":549},{"uri":"Sophie_Germain","surface_form":"Sophie Germain","offset":627},{"uri":"Fermat%27s_last_theorem","surface_form":"Fermat's last theorem","offset":964},{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":1075},{"uri":"Sofya_Kovalevskaya","surface_form":"Sofya Kovalevskaya","offset":1122},{"uri":"University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen","surface_form":"University of G\u00F6ttingen","offset":1243},{"uri":"Kovalevskaya_top","surface_form":"Kovalevskaya top","offset":1289},{"uri":"Sofya_Kovalevskaya","surface_form":"Sofya Kovalevskaya","offset":1396},{"uri":"Sofya_Kovalevskaya","surface_form":"Sofya Kovalevskaya","offset":1422},{"uri":"University_of_Stockholm","surface_form":"University of Stockholm","offset":1512},{"uri":"Emmy_Noether","surface_form":"Emmy Noether","offset":1578},{"uri":"American_Mathematical_Society","surface_form":"American Mathematical Society","offset":1734},{"uri":"University_of_Toronto","surface_form":"University of Toronto","offset":1868},{"uri":"Gladys_West","surface_form":"Gladys West","offset":1920},{"uri":"Lucy_Joan_Slater","surface_form":"Lucy Joan Slater","offset":2116},{"uri":"American_Mathematical_Society","surface_form":"American Mathematical Society","offset":2335},{"uri":"Society_for_Industrial_and_Applied_Mathematics","surface_form":"Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","offset":2462},{"uri":"International_Mathematical_Olympiad","surface_form":"International Mathematical Olympiad","offset":2579},{"uri":"International_Mathematical_Olympiad","surface_form":"International Mathematical Olympiad","offset":2797},{"uri":"Karen_Uhlenbeck","surface_form":"Karen Uhlenbeck","offset":3072},{"uri":"Abel_Prize","surface_form":"Abel Prize","offset":3122}]}
