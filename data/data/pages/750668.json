The case was controversial from the beginning. The U.S. Supreme Court found that the \"carnival atmosphere\" (media) surrounding Sheppard's first trial had made due process impossible. After ten years in prison he was acquitted at a second trial. There was also evidence that he judge from Sheppard's first trial was unfair. Sheppard was represented by F. Lee Bailey.\nIn August 1969 at the age of 45, he became a wrestler known as \"Killer\" Sam Sheppard. Sheppard wrestled over 40 matches before his death in April 1970.\nSheppard died on April 6, 1970 of liver failure after suffering from alcoholism in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 46.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cleveland","surface_form":"Cleveland","offset":98},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":109},{"uri":"Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. Supreme Court","offset":330},{"uri":"Due_process","surface_form":"due process","offset":438},{"uri":"F._Lee_Bailey","surface_form":"F.
