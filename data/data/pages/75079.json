{"id":75079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encore_(concert)","text":"=\"preserve\">An encore is an extra piece that is played at the end a performance. It is not on the programme, although the performer may have secretly planned it. A performer will play an encore if the audience claps a lot. Sometimes the audience shout \"encore!\" when they want an encore. The word \"encore\" is the French word for \"again\".\nAn encore is usually a short piece. Often it is a fast piece to finish the performance off happily, but if a musician has just played a very energetic, loud piece, then the encore might be a quiet piece. A concert given by a solo performer or small group of performers is more likely to finish with an encore than a concert with an orchestra, but a lot depends on the tradition from one country to another.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Event_program","surface_form":"programme","offset":98},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":201},{"uri":"Applause","surface_form":"claps","offset":210},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":313},{"uri":"Solo_(music)","surface_form":"solo","offset":563},{"uri":"Orchestra","surface_form":"orchestra","offset":670}]}
