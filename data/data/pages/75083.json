{"id":75083,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cay","text":"A cay (also spelled key; both pronounced alike as \"key\") is a small, low island consisting mostly of sand or coral and situated on top of a coral reef.\nThe English word \"cay\" comes from the Spanish word \"cayo\" and this from the Ta\u00EDno word \"cayo\" meaning \"small island\". The English words \"key\" and \"quay\" (which means wharf) come from the old French \"kai\" meaning \"sand bank\". Because it is a Ta\u00EDno word, \"cay\" (and the other forms) are used mainly in the Caribbean, but the type of island is found in the tropical seas where there are coral reefs.\nSand cays are built on the edge of the coral reefs, opposite the direction from which the wind blows most of the time. Because of that, cays are often elongated. Tides and wind (and sometimes sea birds) deposit coral debris. Weather affects the formation of cays greatly; large tides would bring much more debris onto the cay and thus make it larger, while a hurricane destroys a cay.\nSome cays are very large; Cayo Coco, north of Cuba, is about 370 km2. Those large cays are being used for tourism because they have beaches with white sand and the presence of coral reefs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":73},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":101},{"uri":"Coral","surface_form":"coral","offset":109},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"coral reef","offset":140},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":156},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":190},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":228},{"uri":"Wharf","surface_form":"wharf","offset":318},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":343},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":456},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":506},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":639},{"uri":"Tide","surface_form":"Tide","offset":711},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":721},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":745},{"uri":"Debris","surface_form":"debris","offset":766},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"Weather","offset":774},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":908},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourism","offset":1040},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":1066}]}
