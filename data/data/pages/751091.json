{"id":751091,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth_facemask","text":"A cloth facemask is a face covering which is used to cover the mouth and nose. As the name suggests, these masks are made of textiles. Cotton is commonly used. Starting with the 19th century, such masks have been used by healthcare professionals. They are also used to protect against air pollution, although they may not be very effective in protecting against air pollution.\nDepending on the design, they can be effective stopping the transmission of disease spread by droplets of liquid. Today, healthcare professionals often use surgical masks or respirators, which offer better protection. A study done in 2010 found that 40 to 90 percent of particles pass through a cloth facemask.\nCloth face masks were commonly used during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, especially when surgical and other medical face coverings were not available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":63},{"uri":"Nose","surface_form":"nose","offset":73},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textiles","offset":125},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"Cotton","offset":135},{"uri":"Air_pollution","surface_form":"air pollution","offset":285},{"uri":"Respiratory_droplet","surface_form":"droplets of liquid","offset":471},{"uri":"Surgical_mask","surface_form":"surgical masks","offset":533},{"uri":"Respirator","surface_form":"respirators","offset":551},{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"2020 COVID-19 pandemic","offset":735}]}
