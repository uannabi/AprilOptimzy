{"id":751153,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinos","text":"In the typology of ancient Greek pottery, the \"dinos\" (plural \"dinoi\") is a mixing bowl or cauldron. \"Dinos\" means \"drinking cup,\" but in modern typology is used (wrongly) for the same shape as a \"lebes\", that is, a bowl with a spherical body meant to sit on a stand. It has no handles and no feet.\nThe Dinos Painter, one of the ancient Greek artists known for vase painting, takes his name from the type of vase characteristic of his work.\nDinos were used for mixing water and wine, as it was considered rude to drink straight out of the goblet, at the time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Typology_of_Greek_vase_shapes","surface_form":"typology of ancient Greek pottery","offset":7},{"uri":"Lebes","surface_form":"lebes","offset":197},{"uri":"Dinos_Painter","surface_form":"Dinos Painter","offset":303},{"uri":"Pottery_of_ancient_Greece","surface_form":"vase painting","offset":361}]}
