{"id":751206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask","text":"A surgical mask, also known as a procedure mask, medical mask or simply as a face mask, is a mask. It is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and during nursing. Such masks are used to catch the bacteria shed in liquid droplets and aerosol<nowiki/>s from the wearer's mouth and nose. They are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators, which provide better protection.\nThere are diffierent qualities of such mask. Despite their name, not all surgical masks should be used during surgeries. Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks.\nSurgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process. They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries. A shortage of surgical masks is a central issue of the ongoing 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.\nSurgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles created by air pollution. Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":156},{"uri":"Nursing","surface_form":"nursing","offset":175},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":217},{"uri":"Respiratory_droplet","surface_form":"liquid droplets","offset":234},{"uri":"Aerosol","surface_form":"aerosol","offset":254},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":385},{"uri":"Respirator","surface_form":"respirator","offset":429},{"uri":"Nonwoven_fabric","surface_form":"nonwoven fabric","offset":713},{"uri":"Melt_blowing","surface_form":"melt blowing","offset":745},{"uri":"Cloth_facemask","surface_form":"cloth facemask","offset":820},{"uri":"Developed_country","surface_form":"developed countries","offset":839},{"uri":"2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic","surface_form":"2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic","offset":923},{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":1027},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1053},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":1060},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korea","offset":1070},{"uri":"Airborne_disease","surface_form":"airborne disease","offset":1116},{"uri":"Particulates","surface_form":"dust particles","offset":1189},{"uri":"Air_pollution","surface_form":"air pollution","offset":1215},{"uri":"Japanese_pop_culture","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":1371},{"uri":"Korean_Wave","surface_form":"Korean pop culture","offset":1384},{"uri":"Youth_culture","surface_form":"youth culture","offset":1441}]}
