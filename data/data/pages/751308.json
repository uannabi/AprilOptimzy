{"id":751308,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_letter","text":"=\"preserve\">Silent letters are letters written in words that do not any sound in the word. In English, these include the \"k\" in \"know\" and \"knee\", the second \"b\" in \"bomb\" and \"numb,\" the \"s\" in \"island,\" and the \"e\" in \"lame\" and \"lime\".\nSilent letters exist in the spelling systems in many languages, but they are very common in languages with deep orthographies, spelling systems with little one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, like English, French, Thai, and Mongolian.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letters","offset":31},{"uri":"Word","surface_form":"words","offset":50},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":94},{"uri":"Orthography","surface_form":"spelling systems","offset":267},{"uri":"Orthographic_depth","surface_form":"deep orthographies","offset":346}]}
