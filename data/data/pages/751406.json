According the the first chapter of the Gospel of John the apostles Peter, Andrew, and Philip came from there. The Gospel of Mark Chapter 8 says that Jesus healed a blind man there. In the ninth chapter of the Gospel of Luke we are told that Jesus fed 5000 people using only 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish.\nModern archeologists have not been able to prove for sure exactly where Bethsaida was.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gospel_of_John","surface_form":"Gospel of John","offset":115},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Mark","surface_form":"Gospel of Mark","offset":190},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":225},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Luke","surface_form":"Gospel of Luke","offset":285},{"uri":"Archeology","surface_form":"archeologists","offset":387}]}
