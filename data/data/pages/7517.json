{"id":7517,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar","text":"A calendar is a tool for organizing days. People use calendars to say when something happened, and for planning things that have not happened yet. The calendar gives the days names and numbers, called calendar dates. The \"dates\" are usually made based on how things in the sky seem to move. The year and month are based on motions of the Sun and moon. By knowing what day something happened or will happen, people have an easier life. Since the beginning of history, knowing when the seasons would start for crops was very important for farmer<nowiki/>s and people who eat.\nCalendar systems have a beginning time or era. The calendar era is often a religion-based event, such as the birth of Jesus, but it may be a political event such as a coronation or the founding of a state. Dates that are counted from the coronation are called \"regnal\".\nThe three principal calendars most used today are the Gregorian, Hebrew, and Islamic calendars. Other calendar systems from many different parts of the world are also used.\nBasis.\nThe Earth turns all the way around its axis about 24 hours. It is called the Solar Day. Day<nowiki/>s of most calendars are strongly based on the Solar Day.\nThe Moon turns all the way around the Earth about 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 2 seconds. Month<nowiki/>s of some calendars are still strongly based on the Moon. These are called Lunar calendar<nowiki/>s, which lasts about 354-355 days. Solar calendar<nowiki/>s ignore the moon, and depend entirely on the Sun.\nThe Earth goes all the way around the Sun in about 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds. This is called the Tropical Year. Year<nowiki/>s of most calendars are strongly based on the Tropical Year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":170},{"uri":"Calendar_date","surface_form":"calendar date","offset":201},{"uri":"Sky","surface_form":"sky","offset":273},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":295},{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"month","offset":304},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":338},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":346},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":537},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":616},{"uri":"Calendar_era","surface_form":"calendar era","offset":625},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":649},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":692},{"uri":"Coronation","surface_form":"coronation","offset":741},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":773},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian","offset":898},{"uri":"Hebrew_calendar","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":909},{"uri":"Islamic_calendar","surface_form":"Islamic","offset":921},{"uri":"Solar_time","surface_form":"Solar Day","offset":1101},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"Day","offset":1112},{"uri":"Month","surface_form":"Month","offset":1276},{"uri":"Lunar_calendar","surface_form":"Lunar calendar","offset":1365},{"uri":"Solar_calendar","surface_form":"Solar calendar","offset":1423},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":1492},{"uri":"Tropical_Year","surface_form":"Tropical Year","offset":1613},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"Year","offset":1628}]}
