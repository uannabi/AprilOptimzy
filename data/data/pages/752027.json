{"id":752027,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Wire","text":"The Daily Wire is a conservative website run by Ben Shapiro. It was created by Shapiro and Jeremey Boering when Shapiro still worked at Breitbart News. It was extremely critical of Donald Trump when Trump was running for President of the United States, though it generally reported on him more positively after he became president. The Daily Wire has published work by Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, Andrew Klavan, Dennis Prager, Michelle Malkin and John Hawkins. They have promoted Prager University, criticized the media for being too left-wing, and promoted Steven Crowder.\nControversies.\nOnce on Columbus Day, the Daily Wire released a cartoon about Christopher Columbus and the Native Americans which relied on racist imagery. Ben Shapiro later deleted the cartoon and apologized for it, though he said that he was on vacation when the cartoon was created. Michael Knowles also caused controversy when, during an appearance on Fox News he called Greta Thunberg a \u201Cmentally ill child\u201D who was being \u201Cexploited by the left\u201D. Fox News apologized for Knowles having said that. The Daily Wire has also been accused of editing people who are politically left-wing out of context.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["website"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Conservative","surface_form":"conservative","offset":20},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":33},{"uri":"Ben_Shapiro","surface_form":"Ben Shapiro","offset":48},{"uri":"Jeremey_Boering","surface_form":"Jeremey Boering","offset":91},{"uri":"Breitbart_News","surface_form":"Breitbart News","offset":136},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":181},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":221},{"uri":"Ben_Shapiro","surface_form":"Ben Shapiro","offset":369},{"uri":"Michael_Knowles","surface_form":"Michael Knowles","offset":382},{"uri":"Andrew_Klavan","surface_form":"Andrew Klavan","offset":399},{"uri":"Dennis_Prager","surface_form":"Dennis Prager","offset":414},{"uri":"Michelle_Malkin","surface_form":"Michelle Malkin","offset":429},{"uri":"Prager_University","surface_form":"Prager University","offset":482},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":516},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":536},{"uri":"Steven_Crowder","surface_form":"Steven Crowder","offset":560},{"uri":"Columbus_Day","surface_form":"Columbus Day","offset":599},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":639},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":653},{"uri":"Native_Americans","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":682},{"uri":"Ben_Shapiro","surface_form":"Ben Shapiro","offset":731},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":761},{"uri":"Vacation","surface_form":"vacation","offset":822},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":840},{"uri":"Michael_Knowles","surface_form":"Michael Knowles","offset":861},{"uri":"Fox_News","surface_form":"Fox News","offset":931},{"uri":"Greta_Thunberg","surface_form":"Greta Thunberg","offset":950},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":981},{"uri":"Fox_News","surface_form":"Fox News","offset":1027},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":1152}]}
