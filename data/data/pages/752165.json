Chicken tikka is made up of boneless pieces of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt, then roasted in an oven. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. Even though a sauce made of tomato and coriander is commonly used, there is no specific recipe for the sauce that everyone uses.\nChicken tikka masala is very popular in the United Kingdom and it has been called a \"true British national dish\". It can be found in restaurants all over the world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roast","surface_form":"roast","offset":58},{"uri":"Marinated","surface_form":"marinated","offset":66},{"uri":"Chicken_tikka","surface_form":"chicken tikka","offset":85},{"uri":"Curry","surface_form":"curry","offset":105},{"uri":"Spice","surface_form":"spice","offset":125},{"uri":"Yogurt","surface_form":"yogurt","offset":212},{"uri":"Coriander","surface_form":"coriander","offset":333},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":467}]}
