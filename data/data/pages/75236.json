{"id":75236,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_the_Saar_Basin","text":"The Territory of the Saar Basin (, \"Saarterritorium;\") was usually called the Saar or the. It was a territory governed by the League of Nations under the Treaty of Versailles for 15 years from 1920.\nIts population in 1933 was 812,000, and its capital was Saarbr\u00FCcken.\nIt was made up of parts of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Palatinate of the Rhine. It was slightly smaller than the modern German state of Saarland.\nCommission of Government.\nAccording to Treaty of Versailles the highly industrialized Saarland was to be governed by the League of Nations for a period of 15 years, and its coalfields given to France. The \"Commission of Government\", which represented the League of Nations, had five members. At least one member had to be French and one a native of the Saar.\nAt the end of the 15 year period, in 1935, the people of the Saar voted on how they wanted their country. They voted to become a part of Nazi Germany.\nIt had a currency, the Saar franc, and its own postage stamps during this period.\nPlebiscite.\nIn 1933, many anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich's control. As a result, anti-Nazi groups wanted the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany. However, France had a lot of power in the Saar, including control of the coal mines. Not many \"Saarlanders\" liked France, and in the plebiscite on 13 January 1935, 90% of the voters wished to join Germany, and 8.86% wanted to stay with the League of Nations. Only 0.40% (that is, four voters in every thousand) wanted to join France.\nNazi rule.\nOn 17 January 1935, the territory's re-union with Germany was approved by the League Council. On 1 March, the Nazi Germany took over the region, and appointed Josef B\u00FCrckel as \"Reichskommissar f\u00FCr die R\u00FCckgliederung des Saarlandes\", \"Reich Commissioner for the re-union of Saarland\".\nMany former politicians and office holders of the Saargebiet were changed or arrested by the Nazis.\nWhen re-incorporation was completed, the governor became \"Reichskommissar f\u00FCr das Saarland\", \"Reich Commissioner of Saarland\" on 17 June 1936.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":126},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Treaty of Versailles","offset":154},{"uri":"Saarbr%C3%BCcken","surface_form":"Saarbr\u00FCcken","offset":255},{"uri":"Rhine_Province","surface_form":"Rhine Province","offset":308},{"uri":"Palatinate_of_the_Rhine","surface_form":"Palatinate of the Rhine","offset":340},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"German state","offset":405},{"uri":"Saarland","surface_form":"Saarland","offset":421},{"uri":"Industrialization","surface_form":"industrialized","offset":502},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":552},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":624},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":686},{"uri":"Saar_franc","surface_form":"Saar franc","offset":964},{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":1054},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"Germans","offset":1059},{"uri":"Third_Reich","surface_form":"Third Reich","offset":1137},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":1237},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":1266},{"uri":"Plebiscite","surface_form":"plebiscite","offset":1427},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1491},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1689},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":1749},{"uri":"Reichskommissar","surface_form":"Reichskommissar","offset":1816},{"uri":"Saarland","surface_form":"Saarland","offset":1912},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":2064},{"uri":"Reichskommissar","surface_form":"Reichskommissar","offset":2081},{"uri":"Saarland","surface_form":"Saarland","offset":2139}]}
