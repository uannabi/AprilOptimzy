{"id":7526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors","text":"The Doors were an American rock band. They were one of the most popular rock groups of all time. Led by singer Jim Morrison, along with Ray Manzarek (keyboards), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums), the group is thought of today as a major influence on rock music, and they are still just as popular as they ever were, if not more popular.\nThe group was widely known for its lead singer, Jim Morrison, who was famous for his love of alcohol and illegal drugs. Morrison often sang at concerts after using alcohol and drugs, sometimes so drunk that he could not remember the words to his own songs. Once, Morrison was said to have shown his private parts to the audience, and he was charged with a crime.\nMorrison died in Paris, France, on July 3, 1971. His death is thought to have been caused by a heart attack brought on by a drug overdose.\nThere is a 1991 movie about them, also called \"The Doors\". It was directed by Oliver Stone and starred Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":18},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":27},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":32},{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popular","offset":64},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":104},{"uri":"Jim_Morrison","surface_form":"Jim Morrison","offset":111},{"uri":"Ray_Manzarek","surface_form":"Ray Manzarek","offset":136},{"uri":"Keyboard_instrument","surface_form":"keyboards","offset":150},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":177},{"uri":"Drum","surface_form":"drums","offset":204},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":253},{"uri":"Lead_singer","surface_form":"lead singer","offset":388},{"uri":"Jim_Morrison","surface_form":"Jim Morrison","offset":401},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":446},{"uri":"Illegal","surface_form":"illegal","offset":458},{"uri":"Illegal_drugs","surface_form":"drugs","offset":466},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":709},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":733},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":740},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":811},{"uri":"Overdose","surface_form":"overdose","offset":845},{"uri":"1991_in_film","surface_form":"1991","offset":866},{"uri":"The_Doors_(movie)","surface_form":"The Doors","offset":902},{"uri":"Oliver_Stone","surface_form":"Oliver Stone","offset":933},{"uri":"Val_Kilmer","surface_form":"Val Kilmer","offset":958},{"uri":"Jim_Morrison","surface_form":"Jim Morrison","offset":972}]}
