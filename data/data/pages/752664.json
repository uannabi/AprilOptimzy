The population of the village in 2011 was 3,270.\nThe village was previously called Bryn-y-Castell (\"Hill of the Castle\" in English). The name changed to Gobowen, this name is believed to originate from \"Gob\" (a pillow) and \"Owen\" (Owain Glynd\u0175r) who was believed to have rested here.\nThe village's population grew up around the railway. The mainline route between Chester and Shrewsbury was built through Gobowen after permission was denied to build it through nearby Oswestry. Gobowen railway station is a Grade II listed building. Today, the station provides direct trains to North Wales, Chester, Shrewsbury, Birmingham and South Wales.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":13},{"uri":"Ceremonial_counties_of_England","surface_form":"ceremonial county","offset":28},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":49},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":61},{"uri":"Oswestry","surface_form":"Oswestry","offset":121},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":254},{"uri":"Owain_Glynd%C5%B5r","surface_form":"Owain Glynd\u0175r","offset":362},{"uri":"Railway","surface_form":"railway","offset":459},{"uri":"Chester","surface_form":"Chester","offset":495},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":507},{"uri":"Oswestry","surface_form":"Oswestry","offset":599},{"uri":"Gobowen_railway_station","surface_form":"Gobowen railway station","offset":609},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"trains","offset":699},{"uri":"North_Wales","surface_form":"North Wales","offset":709},{"uri":"Chester","surface_form":"Chester","offset":722},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":731},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":743},{"uri":"South_Wales","surface_form":"South Wales","offset":758}]}
