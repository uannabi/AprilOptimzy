{"id":752668,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wem","text":"Wem is a small market town in the ceremonial county of Shropshire, England. It is situated 9 miles north of the county town of Shrewsbury.\nThe name of the town comes from the Old English \"wamm\", meaning a marsh, as a lot of marshy land exists in the area of the town. Over time, this formed the name \"Wem\". The area now known as Wem is believed to have been inhabited by the \"Cornovii\", Celtic Iron Age settlers, before the Roman Conquest of Britain. The town is recorded in the Domesday Book as consisting of four manors in the hundred of Hodnet. In 1202, Wem became a market town.\nNow, the town has a population of 5,142. Each year, Wem holds a traditional town carnival which is held on the first Saturday of September, as well as the \"Sweet Pea Festival\" on the third weekend of July.\nThe town has a small railway station on the Welsh Marches line that provides direct trains to Crewe, Manchester and Shrewsbury. The town also has a semi-professional football club, Wem Town FC.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Market_town","surface_form":"market town","offset":15},{"uri":"Ceremonial_counties_of_England","surface_form":"ceremonial county","offset":34},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":55},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":67},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":127},{"uri":"Old_English","surface_form":"Old English","offset":175},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":394},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":424},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":442},{"uri":"Domesday_Book","surface_form":"Domesday Book","offset":479},{"uri":"Hodnet%2C_Shropshire","surface_form":"Hodnet","offset":540},{"uri":"Market_town","surface_form":"market town","offset":570},{"uri":"Carnival","surface_form":"carnival","offset":664},{"uri":"September","surface_form":"September","offset":712},{"uri":"July","surface_form":"July","offset":783},{"uri":"Wem_railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":810},{"uri":"Welsh_Marches_line","surface_form":"Welsh Marches line","offset":833},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"trains","offset":873},{"uri":"Crewe","surface_form":"Crewe","offset":883},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":890},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":905},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":955},{"uri":"Wem_Town_F.C.","surface_form":"Wem Town FC","offset":970}]}
