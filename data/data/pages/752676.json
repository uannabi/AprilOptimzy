{"id":752676,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Meadow","text":"New Meadow, currently known as the Montgomery Waters Meadow for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium located in the county town of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. It is the home ground of Shrewsbury Town FC.\nThe stadium opened in July 2007, replacing Gay Meadow as the club's home ground.\nThe stadium has a capacity of 9,875 spectators and is all seated. It consists of four stands, one on each side of the pitch. In June 2017, Shrewsbury Town applied to the Sports Grounds Safety Authority for permission to convert an existing section of the stadium to a safe standing area. The permission was granted, making them the first club in the English Football League to house a safe standing section.\nUnlike Gay Meadow, the stadium is not located within Shrewsbury town centre and is instead located in the Meole Brace suburb of the town. It has been proven difficult for supporters to get to. The club operates a \"matchday travel plan\". This encourages spectators to walk, cycle or use organised transport where possible. Shrewsbury railway station is just over two miles from the stadium. The Meole Brace Park and Ride bus service is nearby to the stadium, just over a mile away.\nThe stadium's record attendance is 10,210. This was the attendance of a League Cup match against Premier League club Chelsea on 28 October 2014. The cup's sponsor at the time, Capital One, provided two temporary stands which were placed in two corners of the stadium to boost capacity for the match.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":90},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"stadium","offset":99},{"uri":"County_town","surface_form":"county town","offset":122},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":137},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":149},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":161},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_Town_F.C.","surface_form":"Shrewsbury Town FC","offset":195},{"uri":"July","surface_form":"July","offset":237},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":242},{"uri":"Gay_Meadow","surface_form":"Gay Meadow","offset":258},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_Town_F.C.","surface_form":"Shrewsbury Town","offset":435},{"uri":"Sports_Grounds_Safety_Authority","surface_form":"Sports Grounds Safety Authority","offset":466},{"uri":"English_Football_League","surface_form":"English Football League","offset":646},{"uri":"Gay_Meadow","surface_form":"Gay Meadow","offset":711},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":757},{"uri":"Meole_Brace","surface_form":"Meole Brace","offset":810},{"uri":"Walking","surface_form":"walk","offset":971},{"uri":"Bicycle","surface_form":"cycle","offset":977},{"uri":"Shrewsbury_railway_station","surface_form":"Shrewsbury railway station","offset":1026},{"uri":"Bus","surface_form":"bus","offset":1124},{"uri":"EFL_Cup","surface_form":"League Cup","offset":1257},{"uri":"Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":1282},{"uri":"Chelsea_F.C.","surface_form":"Chelsea","offset":1302},{"uri":"28_October","surface_form":"28 October","offset":1313},{"uri":"2014","surface_form":"2014","offset":1324},{"uri":"Capital_One","surface_form":"Capital One","offset":1361}]}
