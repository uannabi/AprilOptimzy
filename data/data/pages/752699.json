{"id":752699,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaghouan","text":"Zaghwan (or Zaghouan; ') is a town in the northern half of Tunisia.\nSituated on a low ridge of the Dorsale Mountains, the town has a mild climate and presents a green aspect. Cold water from here was taken by aqueduct to Carthage. The town is famous for its roses, originally cultivated by Muslim refugees from Spain in the seventeenth century. The town is located around 100\u00A0km due south of Tunis and around 50\u00A0km inland (west) from the Gulf of Hammamet and has an estimated population of around 20,837 (2014). It is the capital of the Zaghouan Governorate.\nOn the mountain south of the city is the Roman Water Temple Djebel Zaghouan (Temple de Eaux), source of an aqueduct which used to take water to the city of Carthage over 100 km away. The ruins here are illustrated in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1840, as 'Temple and Fountain of Zagwhan', the subject of a poem by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":59},{"uri":"Dorsale_Mountains","surface_form":"Dorsale Mountains","offset":99},{"uri":"Carthage","surface_form":"Carthage","offset":221},{"uri":"Rose","surface_form":"roses","offset":258},{"uri":"Moors","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":290},{"uri":"Tunis","surface_form":"Tunis","offset":392},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Hammamet","surface_form":"Gulf of Hammamet","offset":438},{"uri":"Zaghouan_Governorate","surface_form":"Zaghouan Governorate","offset":537},{"uri":"Djebel_Zaghouan","surface_form":"Djebel Zaghouan","offset":619},{"uri":"Carthage","surface_form":"Carthage","offset":715},{"uri":"Letitia_Elizabeth_Landon","surface_form":"Letitia Elizabeth Landon","offset":878}]}
