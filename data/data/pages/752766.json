Club\" gave the episode a score of C- and said that \"'Better Off Ned' isn\u2019t just a lousy half-hour (minus commercials, minus three episode-ending tags in place of any sort of resolution) of The Simpsons because it\u2019s double-dipping on the same premise. It\u2019s a truly lousy episode because it fairly rings with indifference, glib cruelty, and enough lamp-shading of creative exhaustion to serve as platonic ideal for late-run \u2018is that show still on?\u2019 disposability.\" \"Den of Geek\" gave the episode a 3 out of 5 stars and says \"'Better Off Ned' is sweet but feels like a doughnut where the creamy middle has been sucked out. It doesn\u2019t quite miss the edge as much as it dulls it. The opportunities are here for sharper comedy, but the episode cuts across the surface.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Simpsons_(season_31)","surface_form":"31st season","offset":44},{"uri":"The_Simpsons","surface_form":"The Simpsons","offset":60},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":97},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox network","offset":115},{"uri":"Homer_Simpson","surface_form":"Homer","offset":162},{"uri":"Nelson_Muntz","surface_form":"Nelson","offset":176},{"uri":"Mentor","surface_form":"mentor","offset":185},{"uri":"Bart_Simpson","surface_form":"Bart","offset":200},{"uri":"Jealousy","surface_form":"jealous","offset":205},{"uri":"Ned_Flanders","surface_form":"Ned","offset":218},{"uri":"Dedicated","surface_form":"dedicated","offset":257},{"uri":"Max_von_Sydow","surface_form":"Max von Sydow","offset":270},{"uri":"The_War_of_Art_(The_Simpsons)","surface_form":"The War of Art","offset":344},{"uri":"Abraham_Simpson","surface_form":"grandpa","offset":391},{"uri":"Grenade","surface_form":"grenade","offset":448},{"uri":"Sacrifice","surface_form":"sacrifice","offset":585},{"uri":"Superintendent_Chalmers","surface_form":"Superintendent Chalmers","offset":617},{"uri":"School_discipline","surface_form":"suspend","offset":653},{"uri":"Persistence","surface_form":"persistence","offset":733},{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayer","offset":746},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":822},{"uri":"Roasting","surface_form":"roast","offset":880},{"uri":"Choir_(music)","surface_form":"church choir","offset":918},{"uri":"Congratulate","surface_form":"congratulate","offset":958},{"uri":"Jealousy","surface_form":"jealous","offset":1025},{"uri":"Landfill","surface_form":"landfill","offset":1090},{"uri":"Krusty_Burger","surface_form":"Krusty Burger","offset":1167},{"uri":"Lisa_Simpson","surface_form":"Lisa","offset":1252},{"uri":"Counselor","surface_form":"counselor","offset":1288},{"uri":"Therapist","surface_form":"therapist","offset":1339},{"uri":"Revenge","surface_form":"revenge","offset":1556},{"uri":"Crushed","surface_form":"crushed","offset":1737},{"uri":"Ambulance","surface_form":"ambulance","offset":1786},{"uri":"Apologize","surface_form":"apologizes","offset":1812},{"uri":"The_A.V._Club","surface_form":"The A.V.
