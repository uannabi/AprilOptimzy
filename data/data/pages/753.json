{"id":753,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit","text":"A spirit is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body. Other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost. When a body is alive, it has a spirit in it. Death is when the spirit separates from the body.\nChristians believe that spirits exist in Heaven or Hell. (See 1 Timothy 3:16, 4:1)\nSpiritualists believe that spirits can talk with people, or change things in the world. Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way, (see Leviticus 19:31) but a few include this as part of their practice.\nAnother use of \"spirit\" means the main purpose or meaning of a sentence or document. For example, the \"spirit of a law\" is the true meaning of the law which the creator wanted. This phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing, but a judge must decide what meaning is correct.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Being","surface_form":"being","offset":43},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"soul","offset":110},{"uri":"Ghost","surface_form":"ghost","offset":119},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"Death","offset":171},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":221},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"Heaven","offset":262},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"Hell","offset":272},{"uri":"1_Timothy","surface_form":"1 Timothy","offset":283},{"uri":"Spiritual_s%C3%A9ance","surface_form":"Spiritualist","offset":304},{"uri":"Leviticus","surface_form":"Leviticus","offset":463},{"uri":"Definition","surface_form":"meaning","offset":580},{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"document","offset":605},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":645},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":809}]}
