{"id":753058,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welshpool","text":"Welshpool (Welsh: Y Trallwng) is a small town and community in the unitary authority of Powys, Wales. It is the fourth largest town in Powys, with a population of 6,664. It lies on the banks of the River Severn and is in the historic county of Montgomeryshire. It is known for its Georgian architecture.\nThe town is situated around 4 miles (6.4 km) from the border with Shropshire in England. Its name in the Welsh language, Y Trallwng, means \"the marshy or sinking land\". In English, it was initially known as Pool but its name was changed to Welshpool in 1835 to differentiate it from the Dorset town of Poole.\nIt served briefly as the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn after its prince was forced to flee the traditional Welsh royal site at Mathrafal in 1212, by the prince of Gwynedd. Assistance from the English crown (the enemies of the Gwynedd prince) restored the Wenwynwyn dynasty to their lands.\nThe town has a mainline railway station on the Cambrian Line between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth. Managed and served by Transport for Wales, trains run roughly two-hourly each way.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":11},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":41},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":50},{"uri":"Powys","surface_form":"Powys","offset":88},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":95},{"uri":"River_Severn","surface_form":"River Severn","offset":198},{"uri":"Montgomeryshire","surface_form":"Montgomeryshire","offset":244},{"uri":"Georgian_architecture","surface_form":"Georgian architecture","offset":281},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":370},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":384},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh language","offset":409},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":476},{"uri":"1835","surface_form":"1835","offset":557},{"uri":"Dorset","surface_form":"Dorset","offset":591},{"uri":"Poole","surface_form":"Poole","offset":606},{"uri":"Powys_Wenwynwyn","surface_form":"Powys Wenwynwyn","offset":649},{"uri":"Mathrafal","surface_form":"Mathrafal","offset":737},{"uri":"1212","surface_form":"1212","offset":750},{"uri":"Gwynedd","surface_form":"Gwynedd","offset":773},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English crown","offset":802},{"uri":"Welshpool_railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":923},{"uri":"Cambrian_Line","surface_form":"Cambrian Line","offset":946},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":968},{"uri":"Aberystwyth","surface_form":"Aberystwyth","offset":983},{"uri":"Transport_for_Wales_Rail_Services","surface_form":"Transport for Wales","offset":1018},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"trains","offset":1039}]}
