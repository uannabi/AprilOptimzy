It is located on the Creuddyn Peninsula, which protrudes into the Irish Sea, in the historic county of Caernarfonshire. The community currently has a population of 20,701.\nLlandudno is the largest seaside resort in Wales, and as early as 1861 was being called \"The Queen of the Welsh Watering Places\". The town's name is derived from its patron saint, Saint Tudno. The town developed from Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements over many hundreds of years on the slopes of the limestone headland, known to seafarers as the Great Orme and to landsmen as the Creuddyn Peninsula. By 1847, the town had grown to a thousand people, served by the new church of St George, built in 1840.\nIt was specifically built as a mid-Victorian era holiday destination. The town's main modern-day attractions include the Great Orme Tramway, Llandudno Pier and Venue Cymru.\nThe town's railway station is situated on the North Wales Coast Line between Crewe in Cheshire, England and Holyhead, Anglesey. It is also the northern terminus of the Conwy Valley line to Blaenau Ffestiniog.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":18},{"uri":"Seaside_resort","surface_form":"seaside resort","offset":24},{"uri":"Community","surface_form":"community","offset":43},{"uri":"Conwy_County_Borough","surface_form":"Conwy County Borough","offset":60},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":82},{"uri":"Creuddyn_Peninsula","surface_form":"Creuddyn Peninsula","offset":110},{"uri":"Irish_Sea","surface_form":"Irish Sea","offset":155},{"uri":"Caernarfonshire","surface_form":"Caernarfonshire","offset":192},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":304},{"uri":"1861","surface_form":"1861","offset":327},{"uri":"Saint_Tudno","surface_form":"Saint Tudno","offset":441},{"uri":"Stone_Age","surface_form":"Stone Age","offset":478},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":489},{"uri":"Iron_Age","surface_form":"Iron Age","offset":504},{"uri":"Great_Orme","surface_form":"Great Orme","offset":620},{"uri":"Creuddyn_Peninsula","surface_form":"Creuddyn Peninsula","offset":654},{"uri":"1847","surface_form":"1847","offset":677},{"uri":"1840","surface_form":"1840","offset":772},{"uri":"Victorian_era","surface_form":"Victorian era","offset":813},{"uri":"Great_Orme_Tramway","surface_form":"Great Orme Tramway","offset":899},{"uri":"Llandudno_Pier","surface_form":"Llandudno Pier","offset":919},{"uri":"Venue_Cymru","surface_form":"Venue Cymru","offset":938},{"uri":"Llandudno_railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":962},{"uri":"North_Wales_Coast_Line","surface_form":"North Wales Coast Line","offset":997},{"uri":"Crewe","surface_form":"Crewe","offset":1028},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":1037},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1047},{"uri":"Holyhead","surface_form":"Holyhead","offset":1059},{"uri":"Anglesey","surface_form":"Anglesey","offset":1069},{"uri":"Conwy_Valley_line","surface_form":"Conwy Valley line","offset":1119},{"uri":"Blaenau_Ffestiniog","surface_form":"Blaenau Ffestiniog","offset":1140}]}
