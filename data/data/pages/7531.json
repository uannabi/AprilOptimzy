His church, Family Worship Center, is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Swaggart first started his television ministry in 1975, and it continues today, over 33 years later. The show airs nationally across the U.S. and overseas. The weekly \"Jimmy Swaggart Telecast\" and \"A Study in the Word\" are shown nationwide and overseas on 78 channels in 104 countries and live over the Internet. He preaches a message called \"The Cross\" which is that you can only get to heaven through Jesus.\nSwaggart was born in Ferriday, Louisiana, USA. He is a cousin of musicians Jerry Lee Lewis and Mickey Gilley. Swaggart is married to Frances Swaggart, who hosts the popular SonLife Radio program, \"Frances and Friends\". They have one son, Donnie, who is also a minister. They have three grandchildren, Jennifer, Gabriel and Matthew Swaggart. Gabriel also serves the ministry as pastor of Crossfire Youth Ministries.\nHe has also been a very controversial figure, too. He was caught with a prostitute in 1987, but later asked God (and the public) for forgiveness. He was caught again in 1991.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":47},{"uri":"Pentecostal","surface_form":"Pentecostal","offset":56},{"uri":"Televangelist","surface_form":"televangelist","offset":68},{"uri":"Preacher","surface_form":"preacher","offset":85},{"uri":"Religious_service","surface_form":"services","offset":104},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"TV","offset":116},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":125},{"uri":"Baton_Rouge%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","offset":162},{"uri":"Heaven","surface_form":"heaven","offset":574},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":589},{"uri":"Ferriday%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"Ferriday","offset":617},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":627},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":661},{"uri":"Jerry_Lee_Lewis","surface_form":"Jerry Lee Lewis","offset":671},{"uri":"Mickey_Gilley","surface_form":"Mickey Gilley","offset":691},{"uri":"Presenter","surface_form":"hosts","offset":751},{"uri":"Pastor","surface_form":"pastor","offset":973},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversial","offset":1035},{"uri":"Prostitution","surface_form":"prostitute","offset":1083},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":1119},{"uri":"Public","surface_form":"public","offset":1132},{"uri":"Forgiveness","surface_form":"forgiveness","offset":1144}]}
