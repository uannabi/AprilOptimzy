{"id":75330,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld","text":"The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was one of the \"Ernestine duchies\". Ernest, who became elector of Saxony in 1464, divided his territory between his sons, andover the years more and more small duchies existed.\nSaxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was reformed on 29 July 1735, although Coburg and Saalfeld had had the same ruler since 1699. As only men could be the rulers of the duchies, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld ceased to exist in 1825, when the last male descendant of the dukes of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg died. The various dukes reorganised their territories. Saalfeld went the dukes of Saxe-Meiningen, Altenburg went to the Duke of Saxe-Hildburgausen, who gave Hildburghausen to the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. Gotha and Coburg were combined into the new duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ernestine_duchies","surface_form":"Ernestine duchies","offset":50},{"uri":"Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg","surface_form":"Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg","offset":466},{"uri":"Saxe-Meiningen","surface_form":"Saxe-Meiningen","offset":569},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha","offset":743}]}
