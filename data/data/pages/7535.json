{"id":7535,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B","text":"C++ (pronounced \"see plus plus\") is a computer programming language based on C. It was created for writing programs for many different purposes. In the 1990s, C++ became one of the most used programming languages in the world.\nThe C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the 1980s, and was originally named \"C with classes\". The language was planned as an improvement on the C programming language, adding features based on object-oriented programming. Step by step, a lot of advanced features were added to the language, like operator overloading, exception handling and templates.\n[http://www.programstudio.online/2020/05/introduction-to-c.html C++] runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. C++ is simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of [http://www.programstudio.online/2020/05/introduction-to-c.html C++ for beginners] to advanced software engineers.\nC++ is a general-purpose programing language which means that it can be used to create different variety of applications.[https://codinggrammar.com/what-is-cpp-used-for/ C++ is used for] variety of application domains.\nExample.\nThe following text is C++ source code and it will write the words \"Hello World!\" on the screen when it has been compiled and is executed. This program is typically the first program a programmer would write while learning about programming languages.\n// This is a comment. It's for *people* to read, not computers. It's usually used to describe the program.\n// Make the I/O standard library available for use in the program.\n// We are now defining the main function; it is the function run when the program starts.\nThis program is similar to the last, except it will add 3 + 2 and print the answer instead of \"Hello World!\".\nThis program subtracts, multiplies, divides and then prints the answer on the screen.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":38},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":47},{"uri":"C_programming_language","surface_form":"C","offset":77},{"uri":"Bjarne_Stroustrup","surface_form":"Bjarne Stroustrup","offset":273},{"uri":"Bell_Labs","surface_form":"Bell Labs","offset":294},{"uri":"C_programming_language","surface_form":"C programming language","offset":411},{"uri":"Object-oriented_programming","surface_form":"object-oriented programming","offset":460},{"uri":"Operator_overloading","surface_form":"operator overloading","offset":563},{"uri":"Exception_handling","surface_form":"exception handling","offset":585},{"uri":"Templates_(programming)","surface_form":"templates","offset":608},{"uri":"Hello_world_program","surface_form":"Hello World!","offset":1254},{"uri":"Compiled_language","surface_form":"compiled","offset":1299}]}
