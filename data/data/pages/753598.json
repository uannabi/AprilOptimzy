{"id":753598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter_rabbit_incident","text":"The Jimmy Carter rabbit incident, also known as a \"killer rabbit attack\" by the press, involved a swamp rabbit that swam toward then\u2013U.S. President Jimmy Carter's fishing boat on April 20, 1979.\nThe incident became popular in the media after Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell, mentioned the event to a correspondent months later.\nPresident Carter was fishing in his hometown of Plains, Georgia on April 20, 1979, alone in a flat-bottomed boat while staff were on land nearby. Carter said a rabbit being chased by hounds \"jumped in the water and swam toward my boat. When he got almost there, I splashed some water with a paddle\".\nWhen Carter returned to his office, his staff did not believe his story, saying rabbits could not swim, or that one would never approach a person threateningly. A White House photographer took a picture of the incident, which was released by a later administration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Swamp_rabbit","surface_form":"swamp rabbit","offset":98},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"U.S. President","offset":133},{"uri":"Jimmy_Carter","surface_form":"Jimmy Carter","offset":148},{"uri":"Jody_Powell","surface_form":"Jody Powell","offset":268},{"uri":"Plains%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Plains, Georgia","offset":382}]}
