Twenty-four living species are known currently. New ones are frequently found and unknown ones are still being discovered on a regular basis, especially in the Andes.\nScreech owls are not seen in the Americas. Some species formerly placed with them are nowadays considered more distinct. The common name \"screech owl\" is sometimes used for the not closely related barn owl as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Typical_owls","surface_form":"typical owls","offset":33},{"uri":"Strigidae","surface_form":"Strigidae","offset":47},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":75},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":113},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":254},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"Americas","offset":294},{"uri":"Barn_owl","surface_form":"barn owl","offset":458}]}
