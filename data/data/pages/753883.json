{"id":753883,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dakota Access Pipeline protests, also called by the hashtag #NoDAPL, were grassroots movements that began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline in the northern United States.\nThe pipeline was projected to run from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to southern Illinois, crossing beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, as well as under part of Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.\nMany in the Standing Rock tribe and surrounding communities considered the pipeline and its intended crossing beneath the Missouri River would cause harm to the region's drinking water, as well as to the water supply used to irrigate surrounding farmlands. The construction was also seen as a direct threat to ancient burial grounds and cultural sites of historic importance.\nAlmost 500 people were arrested during the protests.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hashtag","surface_form":"hashtag","offset":69},{"uri":"NODAPL","surface_form":"NoDAPL","offset":78},{"uri":"Grassroots","surface_form":"grassroots movements","offset":91},{"uri":"Energy_Transfer_Partners","surface_form":"Energy Transfer Partners","offset":181},{"uri":"Dakota_Access_Pipeline","surface_form":"Dakota Access Pipeline","offset":207},{"uri":"Bakken_Formation","surface_form":"Bakken oil fields","offset":304},{"uri":"Missouri_River","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":389},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":402},{"uri":"Lake_Oahe","surface_form":"Lake Oahe","offset":447},{"uri":"Standing_Rock_Indian_Reservation","surface_form":"Standing Rock Indian Reservation","offset":466}]}
