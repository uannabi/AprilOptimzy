{"id":753922,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_John_Lennon","text":"On the 8 December 1980, musician John Lennon was shot and killed by Mark David Chapman. It happened outside the Dakota in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. Chapman was from Hawaii and had travelled to New York to kill Lennon. Chapman said he was annoyed at how lazy Lennon's lifestyle was and was also annoyed about that Lennon had said The Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\".\nChapman was arrested soon after the shooting and was charged with murder. Chapman pleaded guilty to Lennon's murder and was sentenced to 20-years-to-life in prison. Chapman could have had parole ten times since 2000, but was never accepted. He is still in prison today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Lennon","surface_form":"John Lennon","offset":33},{"uri":"Mark_David_Chapman","surface_form":"Mark David Chapman","offset":68},{"uri":"The_Dakota","surface_form":"the Dakota","offset":108},{"uri":"Upper_West_Side","surface_form":"Upper West Side","offset":126},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":145},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":156},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":188},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":352},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":388},{"uri":"Criminal_charge","surface_form":"charged","offset":449},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":462},{"uri":"Pleaded_guilty","surface_form":"pleaded guilty","offset":478},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"prison","offset":553},{"uri":"Parole","surface_form":"parole","offset":584}]}
