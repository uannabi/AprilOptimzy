{"id":753969,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Map","text":"e=\"preserve\">Character Map is a tool made for Microsoft Windows operating systems. It lets people see characters in a font. It can also be used to see what alt code is used for a character, and it can be used to copy and paste characters.\nThe tool is useful for putting in special characters. The \"Advanced view\" button can be used to switch between different encodings: Windows, DOS, and Unicode. Characters can be sorted by Unicode categories. The tool only supports the first Unicode plane, the Basic Multilingual Plane.\nCharacter Map can be opened by using the command-line interface or the Run command by typing 'charmap'.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microsoft_Windows","surface_form":"Microsoft Windows","offset":46},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating systems","offset":64},{"uri":"Character_(computing)","surface_form":"characters","offset":102},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":118},{"uri":"Alt_code","surface_form":"alt code","offset":156},{"uri":"Cut%2C_copy%2C_and_paste","surface_form":"copy and paste","offset":212},{"uri":"Useful","surface_form":"useful","offset":251},{"uri":"Special_characters","surface_form":"special characters","offset":273},{"uri":"Character_encoding","surface_form":"encodings","offset":360},{"uri":"Windows_code_page","surface_form":"Windows","offset":371},{"uri":"DOS_code_page","surface_form":"DOS","offset":380},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":389},{"uri":"Plane_(Unicode)","surface_form":"plane","offset":487},{"uri":"Command-line_interface","surface_form":"command-line interface","offset":565},{"uri":"Run_command","surface_form":"Run command","offset":595}]}
