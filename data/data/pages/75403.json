{"id":75403,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure","text":"e=\"preserve\">De jure is an expression from the Latin words meaning \"in law\".\nIt is often used in contrast to \"de facto\" (which means \"in fact\", or \"in practice\") when talking about law, governance, or technique. When talking about law, \"de jure\" is used to describe what the law says, and \"de facto\" is used to describe what actually happens.\nExamples.\nThis means that legally the territory of Abkhazia is a part of the country of Georgia, but that it is in effect independent.\nThe \"de jure\" name of Bill Clinton is William Jefferson Clinton. This is his name according to official records. His \"de facto\" name is Bill Clinton because this is what he is usually called.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":47},{"uri":"Contrast","surface_form":"contrast","offset":97},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":110},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":181},{"uri":"Governance","surface_form":"governance","offset":186},{"uri":"Abkhazia","surface_form":"Abkhazia","offset":394},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":500}]}
