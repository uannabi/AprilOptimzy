{"id":754044,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas%27s_fish_eagle","text":"Pallas's fish eagle (\"Haliaeetus leucoryphus\"), also known as Pallas's sea eagle or band-tailed fish eagle, is a large, brownish sea eagle. It breeds in the east Palearctic in Kazakhstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, China, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. It is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.\nApparently, this species achieved its current, essentially land-locked distribution peculiar among sea-eagles due to the collision of Indian Plate with Eurasia. Although the exact timing is not well resolved, it is quite certain that Pallas's fish eagle is a descendant of those sea-eagles which inhabited the northwestern Bay of Bengal when it was a shallow straits separating mainland Asia from India, which still was an island at that time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sea_eagle","surface_form":"sea eagle","offset":129},{"uri":"Palearctic","surface_form":"Palearctic","offset":162},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":176},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":188},{"uri":"Tajikistan","surface_form":"Tajikistan","offset":196},{"uri":"Turkmenistan","surface_form":"Turkmenistan","offset":208},{"uri":"Uzbekistan","surface_form":"Uzbekistan","offset":222},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":234},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":244},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":251},{"uri":"Bangladesh","surface_form":"Bangladesh","offset":258},{"uri":"Myanmar","surface_form":"Myanmar","offset":270},{"uri":"Bhutan","surface_form":"Bhutan","offset":282},{"uri":"Endangered_species","surface_form":"endangered","offset":306},{"uri":"IUCN_Red_List","surface_form":"IUCN Red List","offset":324},{"uri":"Indian_Plate","surface_form":"Indian Plate","offset":473},{"uri":"Eurasia","surface_form":"Eurasia","offset":491},{"uri":"Bay_of_Bengal","surface_form":"Bay of Bengal","offset":662}]}
