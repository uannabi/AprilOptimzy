It is a part of Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems. It can take a screenshot of an open window, rectangular areas, free-form areas, or all of the screen. Snipping Tool also has simple editing tools, like different colored pens, an eraser, and a highlighter.\nA delay option was added to Snipping Tool on June 2015. The delay option lets the program wait from 0 to 5 seconds before making a screenshot. It was replaced on October 2018 by a similar program, Snip & Sketch.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Screenshot","surface_form":"screenshot","offset":32},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":56},{"uri":"Windows_Vista","surface_form":"Windows Vista","offset":83},{"uri":"Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":107},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating systems","offset":115},{"uri":"Window_(computing)","surface_form":"window","offset":170},{"uri":"Rectangular","surface_form":"rectangular","offset":178},{"uri":"Free-form","surface_form":"free-form","offset":197},{"uri":"Pen","surface_form":"pens","offset":304},{"uri":"Eraser","surface_form":"eraser","offset":313},{"uri":"Highlighter","surface_form":"highlighter","offset":327},{"uri":"Delay","surface_form":"delay","offset":342}]}
