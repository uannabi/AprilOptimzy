Neither of the predecessors was a positional system (having a convention for which 'end' of the numeral represented the units).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cuneiform_(script)","surface_form":"cuneiform","offset":46},{"uri":"Phragmites","surface_form":"reed","offset":78},{"uri":"Babylonians","surface_form":"Babylonians","offset":205},{"uri":"Abacus","surface_form":"abacus","offset":334},{"uri":"Sexagesimal","surface_form":"sexagesimal","offset":350},{"uri":"Positional_notation","surface_form":"positional numeral system","offset":372},{"uri":"Sumer","surface_form":"Sumerian","offset":424},{"uri":"Ebla","surface_form":"Eblaite","offset":440}]}
