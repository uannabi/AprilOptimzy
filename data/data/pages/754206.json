{"id":754206,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government","text":"e=\"preserve\">A majority government is when a ruling party (or multiple ruling parties) has more than half the seats in a legislature. This is different from a minority government, when the party with the most seats in a legislature has less than half the seats, and a coalition government, when multiple different parties work together to govern. Usually when elections happen, the parties try to win a majority government. This is because majority governments let them pass all their legislation.\nSometimes, when parties have a very stable coalition for a very long time, people call it a majority government. One example of this is in Australia, where the Liberal and National have parties have worked together in a coalition for several decades.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ruling_party","surface_form":"ruling party","offset":45},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"legislature","offset":121},{"uri":"Minority_government","surface_form":"minority government","offset":159},{"uri":"Coalition_government","surface_form":"coalition government","offset":268},{"uri":"Govern","surface_form":"govern","offset":339},{"uri":"Election","surface_form":"election","offset":360},{"uri":"Legislation","surface_form":"legislation","offset":485},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"Liberal","offset":658},{"uri":"National_Party_of_Australia","surface_form":"National","offset":670},{"uri":"Coalition_(Australia)","surface_form":"coalition","offset":718}]}
