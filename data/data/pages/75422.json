{"id":75422,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfight","text":"e=\"preserve\">A dogfight is a close air fight between fighter planes. It often involves turning, climbing, and swirling.\nDogfights started during World War I when the fighter planes did not have many weapons.\nThe first aerial dogfight occurred during the Battle of Cer (15\u201324 August 1914), when Serbian aviator Miodrag Tomi\u0107 encountered an Austro-Hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over Austro-Hungarian positions. The Austro-Hungarian pilot initially waved, and Tomi\u0107 waved back. The Austro-Hungarian pilot then fired at Tomi\u0107 with his revolver.\u00A0 Tomi\u0107 produced a pistol of his own and fired back. Tomi\u0107 managed to escape, and within several weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian planes were fitted with machine-guns.\nModern weapons such as homing missiles did not exist in that time, and planes could only fight each other with machine guns. Since the machine guns were only useful at close range, the planes had to fly very close together to have combat. Pilots had to fly with many maneuvers to try to not be shot, and be able to shoot the enemy planes. This new type of flying was named dogfighting. Fighter planes made just for this type of flying were sometimes called dogfighters. During World War II many had autocannons firing small, explosive artillery shells. They kept farther apart so they would not be destroyed quickly.\nIn modern air combat, there are many long range weapons that can be used before dogfighting. Homing missiles can be fired much further away from the target than machine guns, and will automatically try to follow the target. These types of weapons make dogfighting less common, but modern planes still have Gatling guns, which are more advanced kinds of machine guns. This is because dogfighting still happens sometimes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter plane","offset":53},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":145},{"uri":"Missile","surface_form":"missile","offset":773},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":854},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1220},{"uri":"Gatling_gun","surface_form":"Gatling gun","offset":1666}]}
