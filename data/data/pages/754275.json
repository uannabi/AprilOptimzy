It is made up of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mondaire Jones of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Cori Bush of Missouri and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. All are people of color under 50, have been supported by the Justice Democrats and are in the left wing of the Democratic Party.\nThe group has been said to represent the diversity of a younger political generation inspired by the Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign. Ocasio-Cortez named the group the \"Squad\" name in an Instagram post a week after Election Day, 2018.\nDuring the 2020 Democratic primaries, it has been said that Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, and Marie Newman, all of whom won Democratic primaries after running against incumbent members of the House of Representatives, as well as Mondaire Jones, who initially challenged an incumbent and subsequently won the primary after she announced her retirement, could join the Squad in 2021.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Progressive","surface_form":"progressive","offset":51},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":114},{"uri":"Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez","surface_form":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","offset":171},{"uri":"Mondaire_Jones","surface_form":"Mondaire Jones","offset":200},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":218},{"uri":"Ilhan_Omar","surface_form":"Ilhan Omar","offset":228},{"uri":"Minnesota","surface_form":"Minnesota","offset":242},{"uri":"Ayanna_Pressley","surface_form":"Ayanna Pressley","offset":253},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":272},{"uri":"Cori_Bush","surface_form":"Cori Bush","offset":287},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":300},{"uri":"Rashida_Tlaib","surface_form":"Rashida Tlaib","offset":313},{"uri":"Michigan","surface_form":"Michigan","offset":330},{"uri":"Justice_Democrats","surface_form":"Justice Democrats","offset":401},{"uri":"Left-wing_politics","surface_form":"left wing","offset":434},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":451},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders","surface_form":"Bernie Sanders","offset":570},{"uri":"Bernie_Sanders_2016_presidential_campaign","surface_form":"2016 presidential campaign","offset":587},{"uri":"Instagram","surface_form":"Instagram","offset":668},{"uri":"Jamaal_Bowman","surface_form":"Jamaal Bowman","offset":776},{"uri":"Cori_Bush","surface_form":"Cori Bush","offset":791},{"uri":"Marie_Newman","surface_form":"Marie Newman","offset":806},{"uri":"Mondaire_Jones","surface_form":"Mondaire Jones","offset":941}]}
