This involves coagulation, blood changing from a liquid to a gel. Intact blood vessels are important to moderating blood's tendency to form clots.\nThe word \"hemostasis\" (, \"sometimes\") uses the combining forms \"hemo-\" and \"-stasis\", New Latin from Ancient Greek \u03B1\u1F31\u03BC\u03BF- \"haimo-\" (akin to \u03B1\u1F37\u03BC\u03B1 \"ha\u00EEma\"), \"blood\", and \u03C3\u03C4\u03AC\u03C3\u03B9\u03C2 st\u00E1sis, \"stasis\", yielding \"motionlessness or stopping of blood\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":59},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":85},{"uri":"Blood_vessel","surface_form":"blood vessel","offset":108},{"uri":"Bleeding","surface_form":"hemorrhage","offset":152},{"uri":"Wound_healing","surface_form":"wound healing","offset":190},{"uri":"Coagulation","surface_form":"coagulation","offset":219},{"uri":"Thrombus","surface_form":"clots","offset":345},{"uri":"Classical_compound","surface_form":"combining forms","offset":399},{"uri":"New_Latin","surface_form":"New Latin","offset":438},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":453}]}
