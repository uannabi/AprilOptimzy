He was important for the creation of modern large-scale particle accelerator concepts.\nHis most notable discovery was his 1952 work with Milton S. Livingston and Hartland Snyder on the Strong focusing principle, a critical step in the development of modern particle accelerators like the synchrotron.\nCourant was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\nHe turned 100 in March 2020 and died the following month.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":76},{"uri":"Particle_accelerator","surface_form":"particle accelerator","offset":143},{"uri":"Milton_S._Livingston","surface_form":"Milton S.
