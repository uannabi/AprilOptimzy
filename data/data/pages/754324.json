The Sadu Jana Vimochana Samara Vedi (SJVSV) agitation began with hundreds of Vedi workers encroaching upon the Kumbazha Estate of Harrison Malayalam Limited at Chengara on 4 August 2007, demanding five acres of land for farming and Rs.50,000 towards initial farming expenses to each landless family among them. They pitched tents on the occupied land and started tapping the rubber trees at the estate for livelihood. The Vedi leader claims that 200\u00A0hectares of land at Chengara is under SJVSV occupation. Really the land struggle is not taking place in Chengara, but in Harrisons Malayalam Estate more than 3\u00A0km away, which is popularly known as Chengara estate. So it got the name \"Chengara Samaram\". A fact is that it is taking place on the Athumpumkulam border of the Harrisons Malayalam Estate not in the border of Chengara.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pathanamthitta_district","surface_form":"Pathanamthitta district","offset":40},{"uri":"Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala","offset":67},{"uri":"Konni%2C_India","surface_form":"Konni","offset":109},{"uri":"Pathanamthitta","surface_form":"Pathanamthitta","offset":142},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":269},{"uri":"Literacy_rate","surface_form":"literacy rate","offset":304},{"uri":"Waterfall","surface_form":"Waterfall","offset":374},{"uri":"Waterfalls","surface_form":"Waterfalls","offset":540},{"uri":"Bullock_cart","surface_form":"Bullock cart","offset":1287},{"uri":"Trucks","surface_form":"Trucks","offset":1301},{"uri":"Four-wheel_drive","surface_form":"Four-wheel vehicles","offset":1311},{"uri":"Cars","surface_form":"cars","offset":1342},{"uri":"Bethel_Marthoma_Church","surface_form":"Bethel Marthoma Church","offset":1449}]}
