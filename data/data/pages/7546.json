{"id":7546,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Massey","text":"=\"preserve\">Edith Massey (May 25, 1918 - October 24, 1984) was an American actress.\nShe acted in several of director John Waters' most well-known movies: \"Multiple Maniacs\", \"Pink Flamingos\", \"Female Trouble\", \"Desperate Living\", and \"Polyester\". Waters discovered Massey as a waitress in a Baltimore, Maryland, USA bar he and his friends frequented.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Massey capitalized on her Waters infamy by touring as the lead singer of a punk band (Edie and the Eggs) and opening a thrift store in Baltimore called Edith's Shopping Bag.\nDirector Robert Maier made a documentary short about her in 1975 called \"Love Letter to Edie\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":66},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actress","offset":75},{"uri":"Film_director","surface_form":"director","offset":108},{"uri":"John_Waters","surface_form":"John Waters","offset":117},{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":146},{"uri":"Baltimore%2C_Maryland","surface_form":"Baltimore","offset":291},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":302}]}
