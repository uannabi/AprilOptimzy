{"id":75465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Halloween_episodes","text":"e=\"preserve\">Treehouse of Horror, or The Simpsons Halloween Specials, is a seasonal special TV episode that is aired in every season (except the first one) where there are three different Halloween-based stories. Most of the time the episodes are about something really scary, unusual, or science-fictional event happening to the family. Since they have nothing to do with the real episodes, they are considered non-canonical (things that do not really happen).\nMost of the time the family encounter horrible things like zombies, aliens, monsters, witches, or sometimes each other. Some episodes spoof horror or science-fiction films (most notably, shows from The Twilight Zone).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Halloween","surface_form":"Halloween","offset":188},{"uri":"Science-fiction","surface_form":"science-fiction","offset":289},{"uri":"The_Twilight_Zone","surface_form":"The Twilight Zone","offset":660}]}
