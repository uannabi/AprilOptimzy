{"id":754757,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckypaper","text":"e=\"preserve\">Buckypaper is a thin sheet made from an aggregate of carbon nanotubes or carbon nanotube grid paper. The nanotubes are approximately 50,000 times thinner than a human hair. Originally, it was fabricated as a way to handle carbon nanotubes, but it is also being studied and developed into applications by several research groups, showing promise as vehicle armor, personal armor, and next-generation electronics and displays.\nProperties.\nComparative flame test of airplanes made of cellulose, carbon buckypaper and inorganic boron nitride nanotube buckypaper.\nBuckypaper is one tenth the weight yet potentially 500 times stronger than steel when its sheets are stacked to form a composite. It could disperse heat like brass or steel and it could conduct electricity like copper or silicon.\nBackground.\nBuckypaper is a macroscopic aggregate of carbon nanotubes (CNT), or \"buckytubes\". It owes its name to the buckminsterfullerene, the 60 carbon fullerene (an allotrope of carbon with similar bonding that is sometimes referred to as a \"Buckyball\" in honor of R. Buckminster Fuller).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
