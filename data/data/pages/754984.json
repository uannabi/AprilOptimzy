{"id":754984,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee","text":"e=\"preserve\">A committee is a group of people that come together to do something or decide something. It is often part of a bigger deliberative assembly. A committee might have a special job to do for a specific topic.\nPurpose.\nA deliberative assembly may create a committee (or \"commission\") that has one or more persons to help with the work of the assembly. For bigger organizations, a lot of work is done in committees. Committees can be a way to get people together that have similar experience from different parts of an organization. Without the committee, these people might not have a good way to share information and work together.\nProcedures.\nWhen a committee is created, a chairman (or \"chair\" or \"chairperson\") is chosen for the committee. Sometimes a vice-chairman (or similar name) is also chosen. The committee chairman often organizes the meetings.\nWhen the committee finishes its work, it gives the results in a report to the larger group. The report may include the methods used, the facts found, the conclusions reached, and any suggestions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Decision-making","surface_form":"decide","offset":84},{"uri":"Deliberative_assembly","surface_form":"deliberative assembly","offset":131},{"uri":"Deliberative_assembly","surface_form":"deliberative assembly","offset":230},{"uri":"Chairman","surface_form":"chairman","offset":686}]}
