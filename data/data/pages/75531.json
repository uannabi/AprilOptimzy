{"id":75531,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_on_It","text":"\"Check on It\" is an R&B song written by Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles, Kasseem Dean, Sean Garrett, Angela Beyinc\u00E9, and Stayve Thomas for the soundtrack to the 2006 movie \"The Pink Panther\", in which Beyonc\u00E9 co-stars. Although not included on its soundtrack album (because it only contains the movies scores), the song is included on Destiny's Child's greatest hits album \"1's\" and on selected non-U.S. versions of Knowles' second studio album, \"B'Day\". It was produced by Knowles and Swizz Beatz.\nMusic video.\nWhen demand was growing for the song, Knowles shot a music video serving as promotion for both \"#1's\" and \"The Pink Panther\". The video was directed by Hype Williams, and was premiered on December 16 2005. The remix of the song in the music video features a remix of \"The Pink Panther Theme\" and a rap from Bun B. The video has a pink theme, with Knowles shown in mostly all pink (to fit in with \"The Pink Panther\"), and the dancers wear pink PVC jackets and dance around rippling pink satin sheets. The video cuts to Knowles wearing a pink polka dot corset against a hot magenta polka dot wall. Where black bars normally appear on a (full screen) television showing a widescreen production, footage is displayed of pink curtains moving in the background.\n\"Check on It\" won the 2006 MTV Video Music Award for \"Best R&B Video\" on August 31, 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rhythm_and_blues","surface_form":"R&B","offset":20},{"uri":"Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles","surface_form":"Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles","offset":40},{"uri":"Swizz_Beatz","surface_form":"Kasseem Dean","offset":57},{"uri":"Sean_Garrett","surface_form":"Sean Garrett","offset":71},{"uri":"Angela_Beyinc%C3%A9","surface_form":"Angela Beyinc\u00E9","offset":85},{"uri":"Slim_Thug","surface_form":"Stayve Thomas","offset":105},{"uri":"The_Pink_Panther_(2006_movie)","surface_form":"The Pink Panther","offset":157},{"uri":"The_Pink_Panther_(2006_soundtrack)","surface_form":"its soundtrack album","offset":228},{"uri":"Destiny%27s_Child","surface_form":"Destiny's Child","offset":319},{"uri":"Number_1%27s_(Destiny%27s_Child_album)","surface_form":"1's","offset":358},{"uri":"B%27Day","surface_form":"B'Day","offset":431},{"uri":"Swizz_Beatz","surface_form":"Swizz Beatz","offset":470},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":549},{"uri":"Hype_Williams","surface_form":"Hype Williams","offset":648},{"uri":"The_Pink_Panther_Theme","surface_form":"The Pink Panther Theme","offset":764},{"uri":"Bun_B","surface_form":"Bun B","offset":803},{"uri":"Pink","surface_form":"pink","offset":826},{"uri":"Widescreen","surface_form":"widescreen","offset":1165},{"uri":"2006_MTV_Video_Music_Awards","surface_form":"2006 MTV Video Music Award","offset":1274},{"uri":"MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_R%26amp%3BB_Video","surface_form":"Best R&B Video","offset":1306}]}
