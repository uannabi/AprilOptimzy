{"id":755436,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumous_award","text":"=\"preserve\">A posthumous award is an award given after the recipient has died.\nMany prizes, medals, and awards can be granted posthumously. Australian actor Heath Ledger, for example, won the Academy Award after his death in 2008.\nMilitary decorations, such as Hero of the Soviet Union or the Medal of Honor, are often given posthumously. Sports awards and titles can be awarded posthumously, for example 1970 Formula One champion Jochen Rindt, who died in a crash late in the season, but still had enough points to be named champion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Posthumously","surface_form":"posthumously","offset":126},{"uri":"Heath_Ledger","surface_form":"Heath Ledger","offset":157},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":192},{"uri":"Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Hero of the Soviet Union","offset":261},{"uri":"Medal_of_Honor","surface_form":"Medal of Honor","offset":293},{"uri":"Formula_One","surface_form":"Formula One","offset":410},{"uri":"Jochen_Rindt","surface_form":"Jochen Rindt","offset":431}]}
