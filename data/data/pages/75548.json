{"id":75548,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Pacific_hurricane_season","text":"The 1983 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 1983 in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1983 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nThis season, there were a record-setting 21 named storms this year. Of those storms, twelve became hurricanes. Eight hurricanes reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. No named storms formed in the central Pacific; however, there were two tropical depressions. A strong El Ni\u00F1o contributed to this level of activity. That same El Ni\u00F1o influenced a relatively quiet season in the Atlantic.\nThe most notable storms were hurricane Tico, Tropical Storm Octave, and Hurricane Winnie. Hurricane Tico left thousands homeless in Mazatlan; Tropical Storm Octave killed several people in one of Arizona's worst disasters; and Hurricane Winnie was a rare December cyclone.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":53},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":61},{"uri":"June_1","surface_form":"June 1","offset":94},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":102},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":148},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":161},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":279},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","offset":458},{"uri":"El_Ni%C3%B1o","surface_form":"El Ni\u00F1o","offset":592},{"uri":"1983_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"season","offset":687},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":701},{"uri":"List_of_Arizona_hurricanes","surface_form":"Arizona's worst disasters","offset":907}]}
