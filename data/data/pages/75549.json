It ended on November 30, 1972. These dates conventionally delimit the period of time when tropical cyclones form in the east Pacific Ocean.\nThis season had a below average number of storms. There were twelve tropical cyclones. Of those, four were tropical storms, eight were hurricanes, and four were major hurricanes that reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In the central Pacific, two tropical storms and two tropical depressions formed. One of the depressions and one of the storms crossed the dateline to become typhoons.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":43},{"uri":"1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":51},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":68},{"uri":"June_1","surface_form":"June 1","offset":84},{"uri":"1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":92},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":133},{"uri":"1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":146},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":211},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","offset":480}]}
