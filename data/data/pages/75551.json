{"id":75551,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Pacific_hurricane_season","text":"The 1977 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 1977 in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1977 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1977. These dates start and end the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The season was very inactive.\nThis season had a record low level of activity. Only eight tropical storms formed, and four hurricanes. No major hurricanes formed. The next time this happened was during the 2003 season. Also, there was just one cyclogenesis in each of May, June, July, August, and October, which is also low. Activity in the central Pacific was zero, as no storms formed there nor moved in from the east. Strangely enough it was also not very active in the Eastern Pacific or the Atlantic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":53},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":61},{"uri":"June_1","surface_form":"June 1","offset":94},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":102},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":148},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":161},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":267},{"uri":"2003_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2003 season","offset":487},{"uri":"1977_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":777}]}
