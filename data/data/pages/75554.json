{"id":75554,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Pacific_hurricane_season","text":"The 1995 Pacific hurricane season was the least active Pacific hurricane season since 1979. Of the eleven tropical cyclones that formed during the season, four affected land, with the most notable storm of the season being Hurricane Ismael, which killed at least 116\u00A0people in Mexico. The strongest hurricane in the season was Hurricane Juliette, which reached peak winds of 150\u00A0mph (240\u00A0km/h).\nThe season officially started on May 15, 1995 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1995 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1995. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven storms attained hurricane status, of which three acquired major hurricane status. The number of tropical storms was much less than the average of 16 storms, while the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes were slightly below average.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Pacific_hurricane_seasons","surface_form":"Pacific hurricane season","offset":55},{"uri":"1979_Pacific_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1979","offset":86},{"uri":"Hurricane_Ismael","surface_form":"Hurricane Ismael","offset":223},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":277},{"uri":"May_15","surface_form":"May 15","offset":428},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":436},{"uri":"June_1","surface_form":"June 1","offset":472},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":480},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":526},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":539},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":657}]}
