{"id":755576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity","text":"Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or social immunity) is a form of protection from infectious disease. This happens when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through previous infections or vaccination.\nWhen many individuals have immunity, they do not spread the disease any more. This either stops or slows the spread of disease.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infectious disease","offset":130},{"uri":"Immunity_(medical)","surface_form":"immune","offset":214},{"uri":"Vaccination","surface_form":"vaccination","offset":277}]}
