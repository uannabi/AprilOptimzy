{"id":75564,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artibonite_River","text":"The River Artibonite (Spanish, \"Artibonito\"; Haitian Creole, \"Latibonit\") is a river in the island of Hispaniola. It is 321\u00A0km long (68\u00A0km in the Dominican Republic, 253\u00A0km in Haiti), the longest of the island and of Haiti.\nName.\nThe Ta\u00EDno name of the river was Hatibonico. Peter Martyr d'Anghiera wrote that the name was \"Attiboni\" or \"Attibonicus\". Some people said that the name was \"Guayajayuco\" but it is another river, tributary of the Artibonite.\nCourse.\nThe source of the Artibonite is to the northeast of R\u00EDo Limpio, in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. The mouth of the Artibonite is in Haiti, south of La Grand Saline, at about. It flows into the Gulf of Gon\u00E2ve.\nThe river is the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti for several kilometres, from the town of Pedro Santana to the point where it is joined by the River Macas\u00EDas, and then turns west into Haiti.\nIts watershed has an area of 9,013\u00A0km\u00B2 (2,614\u00A0km\u00B2 in the Dominican Republic, the rest in Haiti). Its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 16.6 cubic metres per second at Pedro Santana.\nTributaries.\nThe most important tributaries are the rivers Lib\u00F3n, Macas\u00EDas and Joca, all of them in the Dominican Republic. The Lib\u00F3n River is the only important tributary that flows into the right side of the Artibonite.\nEnvironment.\nDeforestation has affected in a bad way the quality and amount of water in the River Artibonite in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. There are not many fishes; only tilapias are caught. There were American crocodiles (\"Crocodylus acutus\") in the River Artibonite and in other rivers of the Hispaniola, but now they are found only in the big lakes of the island.\nUses.\nThe water of the river is used for irrigation in Haiti but not in the Dominican Republic because it flows here through high mountains. The Peligre Hydroelectric Dam was built on the Arbitonite; it produces electricity for Haiti.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":22},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":79},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":102},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":146},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":176},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":234},{"uri":"Peter_Martyr_d%27Anghiera","surface_form":"Peter Martyr d'Anghiera","offset":274},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":425},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":466},{"uri":"R%C3%ADo_Limpio%2C_El%C3%ADas_Pi%C3%B1a","surface_form":"R\u00EDo Limpio","offset":514},{"uri":"Cordillera_Central_(Hispaniola)","surface_form":"Cordillera Central","offset":533},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Gon%C3%A2ve","surface_form":"Gulf of Gon\u00E2ve","offset":668},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometre","offset":761},{"uri":"Pedro_Santana%2C_El%C3%ADas_Pi%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Pedro Santana","offset":790},{"uri":"Watershed","surface_form":"watershed","offset":895},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":1003},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1013},{"uri":"Unit_of_measurement","surface_form":"unit","offset":1067},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":1075},{"uri":"Cubic_metre","surface_form":"cubic metre","offset":1089},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":1106},{"uri":"Pedro_Santana%2C_El%C3%ADas_Pi%C3%B1a","surface_form":"Pedro Santana","offset":1116},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":1163},{"uri":"Deforestation","surface_form":"Deforestation","offset":1366},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":1518},{"uri":"Tilapia","surface_form":"tilapia","offset":1531},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":1572},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":1707},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigation","offset":1769},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"Dam","offset":1895}]}
