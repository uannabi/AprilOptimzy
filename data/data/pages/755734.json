{"id":755734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_script","text":"Khmer script is the writing system used to write the Khmer, or Cambodian, language. The script is an abugida. It was the writing system that Thai and Lao are based on. However, Thai and Lao added tone markers to better suit their own languages, since Thai and Lao are tonal, while Khmer is not.\nOne key feature that Khmer has, while Thai and Lao do not, is that consonant letters have subscript forms. Subscript forms are forms of consonant letters that are written underneath other letters. Similar to how different letters in the Latin alphabet have capital or lowercase forms that look different from each other, consonants in Khmer have standard and subscript forms. These are used to write consonant strings. For example, in the word Khmer (\u1781\u17D2\u1798\u17C2\u179A), the \"kh + m\" consonant string is written as \u1781\u17D2\u1798. By themselves, the consonants that make up the \"kh + m\" cluster would be written as \u1781 and \u1798, but since the \"m\" consonant is the second part of a consonant string, it is written differently under the first consonant in the cluster \u1781. So \u17D2\u1798 is the subscript form of \u1798.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"writing system","offset":20},{"uri":"Khmer_language","surface_form":"Khmer","offset":53},{"uri":"Khmer_language","surface_form":"Cambodian","offset":63},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":74},{"uri":"Abugida","surface_form":"abugida","offset":101},{"uri":"Thai_script","surface_form":"Thai","offset":141},{"uri":"Lao_script","surface_form":"Lao","offset":150},{"uri":"Tone_language","surface_form":"tone","offset":196},{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":362},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letters","offset":372}]}
