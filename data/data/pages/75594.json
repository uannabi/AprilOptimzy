{"id":75594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Temptation","text":"\"Fighting Temptation\" is a single released by R&B singer Beyonc\u00E9 and female rappers Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free in 2003 to promote the film \"The Fighting Temptations\", in which Beyonc\u00E9 has a part. The song is part of the official soundtrack.\nAs it was released just one month after the second single from Beyonc\u00E9's \"Dangerously in Love\", \"Baby Boy\", the song did not become a big hit and failed to enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and other important U.S. charts. However, the single received some attention from European countries, eventually peaking at number thirteen in the Netherlands. The film was also an instant success, mainly due to Beyonc\u00E9's success in Europe at that time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":27},{"uri":"Rhythm_and_blues","surface_form":"R&B","offset":46},{"uri":"Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles","surface_form":"Beyonc\u00E9","offset":57},{"uri":"Missy_Elliott","surface_form":"Missy Elliott","offset":84},{"uri":"MC_Lyte","surface_form":"MC Lyte","offset":99},{"uri":"Free_(rapper)","surface_form":"Free","offset":112},{"uri":"The_Fighting_Temptations","surface_form":"The Fighting Temptations","offset":146},{"uri":"Dangerously_in_Love","surface_form":"Dangerously in Love","offset":321},{"uri":"Baby_Boy","surface_form":"Baby Boy","offset":344},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":413},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":515},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":580}]}
