{"id":756085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte","text":"e=\"preserve\">Astarte (Ashtoreth, also spelled Athtart, Ashtoreth, or Ashtart) is the Queen of Heaven to whom the Canaanites burned offerings and poured libations (Jeremiah 44). Astarte, goddess of war and sexual love, shared so many qualities with her sister, Anath, that they may originally have been seen as a single deity. Their names together are the basis for the Aramaic goddess Atargatis.\nAstarte was a great goddess of the ancient Middle East and chief deity of Tyre, Sidon, and Elat, important Mediterranean seaports. Hebrew scholars now feel that the goddess Ashtoreth mentioned so often in the Bible is a deliberate conflation of the Greek name Astarte and the Hebrew word \"boshet\", \u201Cshame,\u201D indicating the Hebrews\u2019 contempt for her cult. Ashtaroth, the plural form of the goddess\u2019s name in Hebrew, became a general term denoting goddesses and paganism.\nAstarte was worshiped in Egypt and Ugarit and among the Hittites, as well as in Canaan. Her Akkadian counterpart was Ishtar. Later she became assimilated with the Egyptian deities Isis and Hathor (a goddess of the sky and of women), and in the Greco-Roman world with Aphrodite, Artemis, and Juno.\nAstarte is a Semitic queen, and sister of Isis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
