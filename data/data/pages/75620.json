Muslims believe that the Kaaba was built by the command of Allah. The Kaaba\u2019s original architecture has remained the same for centuries.\nBefore Prophet Muhammad.\nAccording to Islamic sources, the Kaaba was a place of worship for angels before the creation of men. After the creation of Adam, the Kaaba was built by him.According to Qur'an, it is the first house on Earth.\nThe Kaaba was buried under the sand by the Noah's flood. After a period of time, it was rebuilt by Prophet Abraham and his son Prophet Ishmael.The Kaaba was a place of monotheism for centuries. Then Amr bin Luhayy brought an idol to the Kaaba. After that, the Kaaba became a place of pagan belief.\nAfter Prophet Muhammad.\nThe Kaaba began to be managed by Muslim<nowiki/>s in 630 AD. Prophet Muhammad removed the idols. Also the Kaaba was cleaned with sacred water (Zamzam) under his guidance.\nThe general architecture of the Kaaba remained the same until 1630 because people wanted to keep the original architecture. Only simple repairs and small decorations were made during this long period of time. In 1630, three walls of the Kaaba were heavily damaged by a storm. Then, it was restored by Murad IV, 17th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The Kaaba has remained the same after this renovation.\nReligious Significance.\nThe Kaaba is the holiest place in Islam. Muslims believe that the Kaaba is the House of God (Baitullah). Prophet Mohammed said the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is one of the three most important mosques on the Earth.\nMuslims are required to make a pilgrimage (hajj) once in a lifetime to the Kaaba. As it is the most holy place in Islam all Muslims pray towards this when they perform the five fardh (necessary acts mentioned in the Qur'an) Salat or prayer. At the end of Hajj season, there is a holiday called Eid al-Adha (English: Festival of Sacrifice).\nArchitecture.\nThe Kaaba is a rectangular shaped building. It is 12 m long, 10 m wide, and 15 m high (33 feet x 50 feet x 45 feet).The Kaaba is made of blue-gray granite.\nInside the Kaaba, there are three pillar<nowiki/>s to support the roof. The floor is made of marble and the ceiling is covered with cloth. Gold and glass decorations are hanging between the pillars.\nCover (Kiswah).\nThe Kaaba was first covered by Abu Karab As\u2019ad, in 60 BC approximately. The cover was made of valuable materials, as a symbol of his respect for the Kaaba. After that, the Kaaba has been covered with the most valuable materials following the tradition of showing respect.\nThe covers are produced by a factory every year, the factory was established only to produce the cover in 1927. The cover is replaced every year on the eve of Eid Al-Adha by 160 technicians.\nThe Kaaba\u2019s cover contains Qur'an<nowiki/>ic verses.
