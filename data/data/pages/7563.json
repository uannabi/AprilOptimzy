Batman made its first appearance in 1939 in \"Detective Comics No. 27\". He was the second DC superhero to be created. The first was Superman. Batman's origin story is that as a young child, Bruce Wayne saw a robber named Joe Chill murder his mother and father after the family left a theatre. Bruce decided that he did not want that kind of violence to happen to anyone else and wanted to avenge his parents death. He then dedicated his life to protect his city, Gotham City. Wayne learned many different ways to fight as he grew up. As an adult, Wayne used a costume to scare criminals so that there would be less crime in Gotham. He called himself Batman...\nBatman's tools.\nBatman uses many different tools to help fight crime, these may vary based on the different iterations of batman. Notable examples include his car which he calls \"the Batmobile\", a motorcycle called the \"Bat-Cycle\", and has a special belt full of tools called a \"utility belt\" and most notably bat-shaped boomerangs called \"Bat-A-Rangs.\" He also has radio signals in his bat ears and can shoot them out to his enemy. He also has tasers built in his suit, shocking his foes. In the movie \"Batman & Robin\" he has ice skates. He also has a kryptonite ring and a kryptonite launcher. He even has a power suit and a Bat-Saber(His version of a lightsaber).\nFriends.\nBatman is often helped from other people in Gotham.
