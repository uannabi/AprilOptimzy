{"id":756749,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Blossom_(candy)","text":"Cherry Blossom is a type of chocolate sold in Canada and made by Hershey Canada Inc. Hershey used to make it at its Canadian manufacturing facility in Smiths Falls, Ontario.\nThe candy was made from the 1890s by the Walter M. Lowney Company of Canada until Hershey took it over as a subsidiary brand. The factory in Smiths Falls, which is north-east of Kingston, Ontario, is now closed.\nThe candy consists of a maraschino cherry and cherry syrup surrounded by a mixture of chocolate, shredded coconut and roasted peanut pieces. The candy is sold in a wrapped 45-gram portion, packaged in a close-fitting cardboard box.\nDespite common belief, filling is not injected inside the chocolate. The cherry candy is covered with an enzyme, invertase, that breaks down the solid into a liquid over the next 1 to 2 weeks.\nThe candy contains 210 calories of food energy, 10g fat (15% daily intake), 29g carbohydrate (10% daily intake), 1g fibre (4% daily intake), 27g sugars and 2g of protein.\nUPC number: 0 68000 70227 0","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chocolate","surface_form":"chocolate","offset":28},{"uri":"The_Hershey_Company","surface_form":"Hershey Canada Inc.","offset":65},{"uri":"Smiths_Falls%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Smiths Falls, Ontario","offset":151},{"uri":"Walter_M._Lowney_Company","surface_form":"Walter M.
