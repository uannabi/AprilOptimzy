{"id":757046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir","text":"Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. It was designed to treat Ebola.\nAs of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19. It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic. It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection. Treatment is given by injection into a vein.\nOn May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19. Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished.\nIn October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive. Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Broad-spectrum_antiviral_drug","surface_form":"broad-spectrum","offset":16},{"uri":"Antiviral","surface_form":"antiviral","offset":31},{"uri":"Medication","surface_form":"medication","offset":41},{"uri":"Biopharmaceutical","surface_form":"biopharmaceutical","offset":67},{"uri":"Gilead_Sciences","surface_form":"Gilead Sciences","offset":93},{"uri":"Ebola","surface_form":"Ebola","offset":135},{"uri":"COVID-19","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":209},{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"pandemic","offset":275},{"uri":"Intravenous","surface_form":"injection","offset":371},{"uri":"Vein","surface_form":"vein","offset":388}]}
