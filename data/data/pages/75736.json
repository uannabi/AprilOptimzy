{"id":75736,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCneburg","text":"L\u00FCneburg is a city in Lower Saxony in north Germany. It is about 50\u00A0km southeast of Hamburg. It is the capital of the District of L\u00FCneburg. About 102,660 people live there.\nThe Ilmenau River, a tributary of the Elbe, flows through L\u00FCneburg.\nIn medieval times the town was very rich due to the salt trade. Salt used to be transported along the Old Salt Route to the Baltic Sea from where it was sent by ship to other countries. There were salt mines near the town for a thousand years. Salt mining stopped in 1980. The salt mining caused a lot of deforestation. The countryside changed into heathland which is called the L\u00FCneburger Heide (L\u00FCneburg Heath).\nOn May 23, 1945 the Nazi war criminal Heinrich Himmler committed suicide in L\u00FCneburg after he had been captured by the British Army. He swallowed a potassium cyanide capsule before his interrogation could begin.\nL\u00FCneburg is twinned with Scunthorpe, England.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxony","offset":22},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":44},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":84},{"uri":"L%C3%BCneburg_(district)","surface_form":"District of L\u00FCneburg","offset":118},{"uri":"Ilmenau_River","surface_form":"Ilmenau River","offset":177},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":194},{"uri":"Elbe","surface_form":"Elbe","offset":211},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"medieval","offset":244},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":293},{"uri":"Old_Salt_Route","surface_form":"Old Salt Route","offset":343},{"uri":"Baltic_Sea","surface_form":"Baltic Sea","offset":365},{"uri":"Ship","surface_form":"ship","offset":402},{"uri":"Deforestation","surface_form":"deforestation","offset":546},{"uri":"Heathland","surface_form":"heathland","offset":590},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":675},{"uri":"War_criminal","surface_form":"war criminal","offset":680},{"uri":"Heinrich_Himmler","surface_form":"Heinrich Himmler","offset":693},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":720},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":774},{"uri":"Potassium_cyanide","surface_form":"potassium cyanide","offset":803},{"uri":"Interrogation","surface_form":"interrogation","offset":840},{"uri":"Scunthorpe","surface_form":"Scunthorpe","offset":892},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":904}]}
