{"id":757364,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon%27s_Souls","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Demon's Souls\" is an action RPG on the Playstation 3 video game console made by Hidetaka Miyazaki and FromSoftware. It is the first game in the \"Souls\" series of video games. It is known for being a very hard game. Its difficulty was liked and disliked by many people. The gameplay has some similar features to FromSfotware's earlier game, \"King's Field,\" like exploring for armor and weapons, having a high difficulty, and having timing-based fighting, but it is different because \"Demon's Souls\" has a third-person point of view.\nThe idea of the game was created some time before the game came out, but many workers in FromSoftware did not think the game would be popular. However, when Miyazaki began working for From, he picked up the project and made \"Demon's Souls\" into a game. Since From was a little-known video game developer and they thought the game would not sell well anyway, From had a lot of freedom of making the game they wanted to make, as they did not have to remove a lot of features to please video game publishers. Surprisingly, \"Demon's Souls\" sold many more copies and became much more popular than From thought. It would be popular enough to make three sequels and two spiritual successors, \"Bloodborne\" and \"Sekiro\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Role-playing_game","surface_form":"RPG","offset":42},{"uri":"PlayStation_3","surface_form":"Playstation 3","offset":53},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game console","offset":67},{"uri":"Hidetaka_Miyazaki","surface_form":"Hidetaka Miyazaki","offset":94},{"uri":"FromSoftware","surface_form":"FromSoftware","offset":116},{"uri":"Souls_(series)","surface_form":"\"Souls\" series","offset":158},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video games","offset":176},{"uri":"King%27s_Field","surface_form":"King's Field","offset":355},{"uri":"Third-person_view","surface_form":"third-person","offset":518},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishers","offset":1040},{"uri":"Bloodborne","surface_form":"Bloodborne","offset":1232},{"uri":"Shadows_Die_Twice","surface_form":"\"Sekiro\"","offset":1248}]}
