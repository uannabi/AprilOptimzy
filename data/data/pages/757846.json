{"id":757846,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_comparison","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pairwise comparison is any process of comparing things in pairs to judge which of two things is preferred, or has a greater amount of some something, or whether or not the two things are identical. The method of pairwise comparison is used in the scientific study of preferences, attitudes, voting systems, social choice, public choice, requirements engineering and multiagent AI systems. In psychology literature, it is often referred to as paired comparison.\nOverview.\nThe person prefers \"x\" over \"y\": \"x\"\u00A0>\u00A0\"y\" or \"xPy\"\nThe person prefers \"y\" over \"x\": \"y\"\u00A0>\u00A0\"x\" or \"yPx\"\nThe person has no preference between both alternatives: \"x\"\u00A0=\u00A0\"y\" or \"xIy\"\nTransitivity.\nIt is generally assumed that pairwise comparisons are transitive. Most agree on what transitivity is, though there is debate about the transitivity of indifference. The rules of transitivity are as follows.\nThis is linked to (xPy or xIy) being a total preorder, P being the related strict weak order, and I being the related equivalence relation.\nArgument for intransitivity of indifference.\nSome believe that indifference (lack of preference) is not transitive. Consider the following example. Suppose you like apples and you prefer apples that are larger. Now suppose there exists an apple A, an apple B, and an apple C that are the same except for the following. Suppose B is larger than A, but it is not possible to see this without an extremely sensitive measuring device. Also suppose C is larger than B, but this also can't be seen without a sensitive measuring device. However, the difference in sizes between apples A and C is large enough that you can see it. In psychophysical terms, the size difference between A and C is above the just noticeable difference ('jnd') while the size differences between A and B and B and C are below the jnd.\nYou are confronted with the three apples in pairs without a sensitive measuring device. Because of this, when shown only A and B, you have no preference between apple A and apple B; and you are indifferent between apple B and apple C when shown only B and C. However, when the pair A and C are shown, you prefer C over A.\nPreference orders.\nwhere \"S\"2(\"n\",\u00A0\"k\") is the Stirling number of the second kind.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Voting_system","surface_form":"voting systems","offset":304},{"uri":"Social_choice_theory","surface_form":"social choice","offset":320},{"uri":"Psychology","surface_form":"psychology","offset":405},{"uri":"Strict_weak_ordering","surface_form":"total preorder","offset":923},{"uri":"Strict_weak_ordering","surface_form":"strict weak order","offset":959},{"uri":"Equivalence_relation","surface_form":"equivalence relation","offset":1002}]}
