{"id":758031,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loei_Province","text":"Loei (Thai: \u0E40\u0E25\u0E22,), is one of the least populated provinces (\"changwat\") of Thailand. It is in upper northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Neighboring provinces are (from east clockwise) Nong Khai, Udon Thani, Nongbua Lamphu, Khon Kaen, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok. In the north it borders Xaignabouli and Vientiane Province of Laos.\n, the provincial governor is Chaiwat Chuenkosum. The province was given 225.6 million baht in the FY2019 Thailand budget.\nHistory.\nTradition says that Loei was created by people from Chiang Saen, the capital of Lan Na. Khun Pha Muang created the village of Dan-kwa, and Bang Klang Hao created Dan Sai. Drought and disease later made to the people move to the site of present-day Loei. In 1907 King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) created the Loei Province. The Loei Cultural Centre (\u0E28\u0E39\u0E19\u0E22\u0E4C\u0E27\u0E31\u0E12\u0E19\u0E18\u0E23\u0E23\u0E21\u0E08\u0E31\u0E07\u0E2B\u0E27\u0E31\u0E14\u0E40\u0E25\u0E22) shows Loei's history, religions, and traditions.\nGeography.\nThe land has many mountains. The seat of provincial government, Loei, is in a fertile basin where mountains are all around it. The most famous mountains in the province are Phu Kradueng, Phu Luang, and Phu Ruea. The Loei River, which flows through the province, is a tributary of the Mekong, which creates part of the northern border of the province with neighboring Laos. Phu Thap Buek, the tallest mountain of the Phetchabun Range, is in the province.\nThe mountain Phu Kradueng is in Phu Kradueng National Park (\u0E2D\u0E38\u0E17\u0E22\u0E32\u0E19\u0E41\u0E2B\u0E48\u0E07\u0E0A\u0E32\u0E15\u0E34\u0E20\u0E39\u0E01\u0E23\u0E30\u0E14\u0E36\u0E07).\nThe western part of the province reaches the southern end of the Luang Prabang Range mountain area of the Thai highlands.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is an important part of Loei's economy. Macadamia nuts, passion fruit, and Arabica coffee are grown in the highlands; bananas, sesame, and rubber are grown on the plains. Loei is a popular place for tourists who want to look at the environment. This is because of Loei's natural environment and amalgam of northern and northeastern cultures.\nWang Saphung District has a big open pit gold mine that employs many people. The area has been the place of a long-standing disagreement as well as fights between the people of Ban Na Nong Bong and its environs and Tungkum Limited, a subsidiary of Tongkah Harbour PCL. Tungkum's gold mining work has been accused of environmental destruction in the courts.\nProvincial government.\nThe province is divided into 14 districts (\"amphoe\"). The districts are further divided into 89 subdistricts (\"tambons\") and 839 villages (\"mubans\").\nLocal government.\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Loei Provincial Administration Organisation (\"ongkan borihan suan changwat\") and 29 municipal (\"thesaban\") areas in the province. Loei with Wang Saphung have town (\"thesaban mueang\") status. Further 27 subdistrict municipalities (\"thesaban tambon\"). The non-municipal areas are governed by 71 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (\"ongkan borihan suan tambon\").\nTransportation.\nRoute 201 comes from Chiang Khan in the north on the border with Laos. It goes through Loei, to Non Sa-at near Chum Phae. Route 203 leads west to the area of Phu Ruea, and then turns south to Lom Sak.\nLoei Airport is the local airport.\nSymbols.\nThe seal of the province shows the stupa at Phra That Si Song Rak, which was built in 1560 by King Maha Chakrapat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and King Chai Chetha of Lan Xang. It was built as a symbol of friendship between the two kingdoms. The provincial tree is the Khasi pine (\"Pinus kesiya\").\nThe slogan of the province is \"city of the sea of mountains, coldest place in Siam, with beautiful flowers of three seasons.\"\nHuman achievement index 2017.\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has watched progress on human development for the provinces using the Human achievement index (HAI). The HAI is a list including all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this job since 2017.\nNotes.\nReports (data) from Thai government are \"not copyrightable\" (Public Domain), Copyright Act 2537 (1994), section 7.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thai_alphabet","surface_form":"Thai","offset":6},{"uri":"%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%A2","surface_form":"\u0E40\u0E25\u0E22","offset":12},{"uri":"Provinces_of_Thailand","surface_form":"provinces","offset":49},{"uri":"Thailand","surface_form":"Thailand","offset":75},{"uri":"Isan","surface_form":"Isan","offset":135},{"uri":"Nong_Khai_Province","surface_form":"Nong Khai","offset":189},{"uri":"Udon_Thani_Province","surface_form":"Udon Thani","offset":200},{"uri":"Nong_Bua_Lamphu_Province","surface_form":"Nongbua Lamphu","offset":212},{"uri":"Khon_Kaen_Province","surface_form":"Khon Kaen","offset":228},{"uri":"Phetchabun_Province","surface_form":"Phetchabun","offset":239},{"uri":"Phitsanulok_Province","surface_form":"Phitsanulok","offset":251},{"uri":"Xaignabouli_Province","surface_form":"Xaignabouli","offset":288},{"uri":"Vientiane_Province","surface_form":"Vientiane Province","offset":304},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":326},{"uri":"Thai_baht","surface_form":"baht","offset":418},{"uri":"Fiscal_year","surface_form":"FY2019","offset":430},{"uri":"Lan_Na","surface_form":"Lan Na","offset":543},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"Drought","offset":634},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":646},{"uri":"Chulalongkorn","surface_form":"Chulalongkorn","offset":730},{"uri":"Loei_town","surface_form":"Loei","offset":955},{"uri":"Basin","surface_form":"basin","offset":977},{"uri":"Phu_Kradueng","surface_form":"Phu Kradueng","offset":1064},{"uri":"Phu_Luang","surface_form":"Phu Luang","offset":1078},{"uri":"Phu_Ruea","surface_form":"Phu Ruea","offset":1093},{"uri":"Loei_River","surface_form":"Loei River","offset":1107},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1158},{"uri":"Mekong","surface_form":"Mekong","offset":1175},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":1258},{"uri":"Phu_Thap_Buek","surface_form":"Phu Thap Buek","offset":1264},{"uri":"Phetchabun_Range","surface_form":"Phetchabun Range","offset":1307},{"uri":"Phu_Kradueng_National_Park","surface_form":"Phu Kradueng National Park","offset":1377},{"uri":"Luang_Prabang_Range","surface_form":"Luang Prabang Range","offset":1495},{"uri":"Thai_highlands","surface_form":"Thai highlands","offset":1536},{"uri":"Macadamia_nut","surface_form":"Macadamia nut","offset":1613},{"uri":"Passion_fruit","surface_form":"passion fruit","offset":1629},{"uri":"Highland","surface_form":"highland","offset":1680},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":1691},{"uri":"Sesame","surface_form":"sesame","offset":1700},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":1712},{"uri":"Plains","surface_form":"plains","offset":1736},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourists","offset":1772},{"uri":"Wang_Saphung_District","surface_form":"Wang Saphung District","offset":1915},{"uri":"Tongkah_Harbour_Public_Company_Limited","surface_form":"Tongkah Harbour PCL","offset":2163},{"uri":"Amphoe","surface_form":"amphoe","offset":2339},{"uri":"Tambon","surface_form":"tambon","offset":2406},{"uri":"Muban","surface_form":"muban","offset":2435},{"uri":"Thesaban_mueang","surface_form":"thesaban mueang","offset":2666},{"uri":"Thesaban_tambon","surface_form":"thesaban tambon","offset":2732},{"uri":"Chiang_Khan_District","surface_form":"Chiang Khan","offset":2910},{"uri":"Laos","surface_form":"Laos","offset":2954},{"uri":"Non_Sa-at","surface_form":"Non Sa-at","offset":2985},{"uri":"Chum_Phae_District","surface_form":"Chum Phae","offset":3000},{"uri":"Phu_Ruea","surface_form":"Phu Ruea","offset":3047},{"uri":"Lom_Sak_District","surface_form":"Lom Sak","offset":3081},{"uri":"Loei_Airport","surface_form":"Loei Airport","offset":3090},{"uri":"Airport","surface_form":"airport","offset":3116},{"uri":"Seals_of_The_Provinces_of_Thailand","surface_form":"seal of the province","offset":3138},{"uri":"Stupa","surface_form":"stupa","offset":3169},{"uri":"Phra_That_Si_Song_Rak","surface_form":"Phra That Si Song Rak","offset":3178},{"uri":"Ayutthaya_Kingdom","surface_form":"Ayutthaya Kingdom","offset":3255},{"uri":"Setthathirath","surface_form":"Chai Chetha","offset":3282},{"uri":"Lan_Xang","surface_form":"Lan Xang","offset":3297},{"uri":"Khasi_pine","surface_form":"Khasi pine","offset":3399},{"uri":"Slogan","surface_form":"slogan","offset":3432},{"uri":"Human_achievement_index","surface_form":"Human achievement index","offset":3722}]}
