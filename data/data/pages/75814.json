It is the largest lake in the Middle East.\nThe location of Lake Urmia is at. It has a surface area of about 5,200 km\u00B2 (2,000 mile\u00B2). At its biggest extent, it is about 140\u00A0km (87 miles) long, and 55\u00A0km (34 miles) wide. Its deepest point is approximately 16 m (52 ft) deep.

Tabriz is the biggest city to its east, and Urmia is the biggest city to its west. The shortest way between these cities is to go round the lake.

However, the project was started again in 2000s; it is planned to be finished by the end of 2007.\nThe lake has a very salty water. The concentration of salt is different in each season of the year; it may be 26-28% in the late Autumn.\nLake Urmia is getting smaller and smaller each year. This is because the rivers which bring water to it have become smaller.\nHistory.\nThis lake was historically named Chaychast (Persian: \u0686\u06CC\u0686\u0633\u062A). Later, it was named \"Urmia\" by the Assyrian people. The word \"Urmia\" consists of two parts: \"ur\" means city and \"mia\" means water. \"Urmia\" was the name given to the city of Urmia, which is near this lake. The lake was then named Lake Urmia, after the name given to the city. In the early years of the 20th century, it was named \"Rezaiyeh Lake\" after the name of Reza Pahlavi, the king of Iran. After the Islamic Revolution, its name was changed back to \"Urmia Lake\".\nLife near Lake Urmia.\nDifferent creatures live inside or near this lake, including some species of shrimps, amphibians and birds like flamingos and pelicans.\nUrmia Lake has shallow borders with lots of mud.
