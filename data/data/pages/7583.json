{"id":7583,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev","text":"Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev (sometimes spelled Gorbachov) (born 2 March 1931) is a former Soviet politician.\nHe was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1985-91), Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (head of state) (1988-91) and the first (and last) president of the Soviet Union (1990-dissolved 1991). Gorbachev is known for forming a friendship with President of the United States Ronald Reagan. Both of them would help end the Cold War.\nEarly life.\nGorbachev was born in Privolnoye, Stavropol Krai, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He grew up in a Kolkhoz collective farm, did well in school, and joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nSecretary General of the Soviet Union.\nIndirectly, this may have helped cause the end of the power of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), and the break-up of the Soviet Union into smaller countries. However, it should be noted that the need to modernise the economy, and to conduct government less ruthlessly than Stalin, was agreed by the previous two leaders. They, Andropov and Chernenko, were elderly and died before real changes could be put in place.\nIn 1990, Gorbachev created the office of President of the Soviet Union. It was to be based on the systems in France and the United States. The office merged office of General Secretary and head of state. The President was to be elected by the Soviet People but its only holder was Gorbachev who wasn't elected. Gorbachev saw the office mainly as a position for himself to remain influential in Soviet politics. His main goal was to keep the Soviet Union together, controlled by Moscow.\nAfter the August coup in 1991 Gorbachev resigned as leader of the Communist Party and held onto the Soviet presidency. When Union republics began to turn away from the Soviet system, Gorbachev's power was dramatically reduced. By late 1991 he had almost no influence outside of Moscow. When Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia became independent, Gorbachev was basically a President of a country that only existed on paper. He resigned on December 25, 1991.\nPersonal life.\nGorbachev studied law at Lomonosov Moscow State University where he also met his future wife Raisa Gorbachova. Raisa studied sociology. After retiring from politics in 1991, Gorbachev started The Gorbachev Foundation, which is currently headed by his daughter Irina. In 2004, he traveled to the United States to represent Russia at Ronald Reagan's funeral.\nAwards.\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. He won a Grammy Award in 2004 with Bill Clinton and Sophia Loren for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for their recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":92},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":398},{"uri":"Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"Ronald Reagan","offset":429},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":476},{"uri":"Stavropol_Krai","surface_form":"Stavropol Krai","offset":532},{"uri":"Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Russian SFSR","offset":548},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":562},{"uri":"Kolkhoz","surface_form":"Kolkhoz","offset":592},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Communist Party of the Soviet Union","offset":652},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Communist Party of the Soviet Union","offset":795},{"uri":"Stalin","surface_form":"Stalin","offset":1015},{"uri":"Andropov","surface_form":"Andropov","offset":1069},{"uri":"Chernenko","surface_form":"Chernenko","offset":1082},{"uri":"President_of_the_French_Republic","surface_form":"France","offset":1267},{"uri":"Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"began to turn away","offset":1784},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":2131},{"uri":"Lomonosov_Moscow_State_University","surface_form":"Lomonosov Moscow State University","offset":2138},{"uri":"Raisa_Gorbachova","surface_form":"Raisa Gorbachova","offset":2206},{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":2238},{"uri":"The_Gorbachev_Foundation","surface_form":"The Gorbachev Foundation","offset":2305},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2408},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":2435},{"uri":"Death_and_state_funeral_of_Ronald_Reagan","surface_form":"funeral","offset":2461},{"uri":"Nobel_Peace_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":2497},{"uri":"1990","surface_form":"1990","offset":2518},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":2533},{"uri":"Bill_Clinton","surface_form":"Bill Clinton","offset":2559},{"uri":"Sophia_Loren","surface_form":"Sophia Loren","offset":2576},{"uri":"Sergei_Prokofiev","surface_form":"Sergei Prokofiev","offset":2652},{"uri":"Peter_and_the_Wolf","surface_form":"Peter and the Wolf","offset":2671}]}
