{"id":75844,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostomata","text":"Gnathostomata is the group of vertebrates with jaws.\nThe group was meant to include all jawed fish, but in modern fashion it also includes all the tetrapods as well, since they evolved from jawed fish. It is the sister group of the Agnatha, the jawless vertebrates.\nThe Gnathostomata first appeared in the Ordovician period and became diverse in the Devonian period, the 'Age of Fishes'. Land vertebrates appeared in the Carboniferous period.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vertebrate","surface_form":"vertebrate","offset":30},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":47},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":94},{"uri":"Agnatha","surface_form":"Agnatha","offset":232},{"uri":"Ordovician","surface_form":"Ordovician","offset":306},{"uri":"Devonian","surface_form":"Devonian","offset":350},{"uri":"Carboniferous","surface_form":"Carboniferous","offset":421}]}
