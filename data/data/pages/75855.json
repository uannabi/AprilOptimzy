{"id":75855,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Sudan","text":"e=\"preserve\">French Sudan (Fr.: \"Soudan\") was a colony in French West Africa.\nExistence.\nIt existed at two separate times. The first time was from 1890 to 1899, and the second was from 1920 to 1960. In 1960 it became the independent nation of Mali.\nBeginning.\nIt was created as a French territory on September 9, 1880 and its name was \"Upper Senegal\".\nName.\nThe name changed to the \"French Sudan Territory\" on August 18, 1890, and its capital was Kayes. On October 10, 1899, French Sudan was broken into pieces: 11 southern provinces became part of French Guinea, C\u00F4te d'Ivoire and Dahomey. However, two provinces were returned in 1900.\nHistory.\nIn 1902 the parts of the colony which were not organised into military districts became Senegambia and Niger, then the name changed to Upper Senegal and Niger in 1904. Finally, the old name of French Sudan returned in a reorganisation in 1920.\nIn 1933, Upper Volta stopped existing (It began again in 1947.) and French Sudan gained some of its provinces.\nIndependence.\nAfter the October 4, 1958 French vote about the constitution, the \"R\u00E9publique Soudanaise\" joined the French Community, again with the name French Sudan, and it gained complete domestic control on 25 November, 1958.\nOn April 4, 1959, French Sudan was joined with Senegal to form the Mali Federation. This became fully independent but still inside the French Community on June 20, 1960. This union finished on August 20, 1960, when Senegal left. On 22 September, French Sudan changed its name to the Republic of Mali and left the French Community.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"Fr.","offset":27},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":48},{"uri":"French_West_Africa","surface_form":"French West Africa","offset":58},{"uri":"1890","surface_form":"1890","offset":147},{"uri":"1899","surface_form":"1899","offset":155},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":185},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":193},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":202},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":243},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":280},{"uri":"September_9","surface_form":"September 9","offset":300},{"uri":"1880","surface_form":"1880","offset":313},{"uri":"August_18","surface_form":"August 18","offset":410},{"uri":"1890","surface_form":"1890","offset":421},{"uri":"Kayes","surface_form":"Kayes","offset":447},{"uri":"October_10","surface_form":"October 10","offset":457},{"uri":"1899","surface_form":"1899","offset":469},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":515},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":524},{"uri":"French_Guinea","surface_form":"French Guinea","offset":549},{"uri":"C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire","surface_form":"C\u00F4te d'Ivoire","offset":564},{"uri":"Dahomey","surface_form":"Dahomey","offset":582},{"uri":"1900","surface_form":"1900","offset":631},{"uri":"1902","surface_form":"1902","offset":649},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":671},{"uri":"Senegambia_and_Niger","surface_form":"Senegambia and Niger","offset":734},{"uri":"Upper_Senegal_and_Niger","surface_form":"Upper Senegal and Niger","offset":781},{"uri":"1904","surface_form":"1904","offset":808},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":884},{"uri":"1933","surface_form":"1933","offset":893},{"uri":"Upper_Volta","surface_form":"Upper Volta","offset":899},{"uri":"1947","surface_form":"1947","offset":947},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":990},{"uri":"October_4","surface_form":"October 4","offset":1025},{"uri":"1958","surface_form":"1958","offset":1036},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"vote","offset":1048},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":1063},{"uri":"French_Community","surface_form":"French Community","offset":1116},{"uri":"25_November","surface_form":"25 November","offset":1211},{"uri":"1958","surface_form":"1958","offset":1224},{"uri":"April_4","surface_form":"April 4","offset":1233},{"uri":"1959","surface_form":"1959","offset":1242},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":1277},{"uri":"Mali_Federation","surface_form":"Mali Federation","offset":1297},{"uri":"French_Community","surface_form":"French Community","offset":1365},{"uri":"June_20","surface_form":"June 20","offset":1385},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":1394},{"uri":"August_20","surface_form":"August 20","offset":1423},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":1434},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":1445},{"uri":"22_September","surface_form":"22 September","offset":1462},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Republic of Mali","offset":1513},{"uri":"French_Community","surface_form":"French Community","offset":1543}]}
