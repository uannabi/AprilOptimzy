{"id":758836,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada","text":"The Queen's Privy Council for Canada (QPC;; called the King's Privy Council for Canada when there is a king), sometimes called just the Privy Council, is a group of people that help the monarch (king or queen) of Canada. They give advice to the monarch on things happening related to the government. The monarch or the person that represents them (the Governor General) have to follow the advice of a group of people in the Privy Council, called the cabinet. They are usually part of the government, and are usually members of Parliament (MPs). People that are part of the Privy Council are called \"Privy Councillors\".\nWhen people join the Privy Council, they become members of it for the rest of their lives. They are chosen by the Governor General based on who the Prime Minister says should be in the council. Because of this, many of the Privy Councillors are people that used to be part of the cabinet, but are not anymore. Other Privy Councillors might be people that have important roles, like being the Leader of the Opposition.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Monarchy_of_Canada","surface_form":"king","offset":103},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"monarch","offset":186},{"uri":"Government_of_Canada","surface_form":"government","offset":288},{"uri":"Governor_General_of_Canada","surface_form":"Governor General","offset":352},{"uri":"Cabinet_of_Canada","surface_form":"cabinet","offset":450},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"members of Parliament","offset":516},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Canada","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":767},{"uri":"Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Canada)","surface_form":"Leader of the Opposition","offset":1011}]}
