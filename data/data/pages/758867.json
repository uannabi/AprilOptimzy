{"id":758867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBM_(file_format)","text":"MBM (an abbreviation of Multibitmap) is a file format that is a collection of bitmap images (which is why the file format has that name). The images are not stored the same. Instead, the images are stored with a modified bitmap header with no compression or 8-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit or 24-bit RLE compression.\nMBM files are used by most Symbian GUI applications to store graphics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["file format"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviation","offset":8},{"uri":"File_format","surface_form":"file format","offset":42},{"uri":"Bitmap","surface_form":"bitmap","offset":78},{"uri":"Run-length_encoding","surface_form":"RLE","offset":290},{"uri":"Graphical_user_interfaces_and_consoles","surface_form":"GUI","offset":342}]}
