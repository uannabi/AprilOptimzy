{"id":758902,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_and_Checkout_Building","text":"The Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building (commonly referred to as the 'O&C\") is a factory located at Kennedy Space Center.\nThe building was built in 1964, and made from reinforced concrete and steel.\nIt's purpose is to make and test out rocket parts such as the Apollo Command/Service Module, Lunar Module, Space Shuttle Spacelab modules, and truss components for the International Space Station. Once manufacturing and check-testing is complete, the spacecraft modules or space stations are checked out of the factory to the SSPF or the Vehicle Assembly Building for integration and launch.\nThe O&C is actually a two-part building with connected overhead walkways. The front building is where astronauts live in dormitories before launching into space. It also has a few conference rooms, several laboratories, and a restaurant. The rear building is where the spacecraft manufacturing workshop is located.\nIn 2014, the O&C was named in honor of the first man on the moon: Neil Armstrong.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kennedy_Space_Center","surface_form":"Kennedy Space Center","offset":112},{"uri":"International_Space_Station","surface_form":"International Space Station","offset":379},{"uri":"Space_Station_Processing_Facility","surface_form":"SSPF","offset":537},{"uri":"Vehicle_Assembly_Building","surface_form":"Vehicle Assembly Building","offset":549}]}
