{"id":758913,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Coast_League","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Pacific Coast League (PCL) is a minor league baseball league in the United States. Like the International League and the Mexican League, the PCL plays at the Triple-A level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball (MLB). It was so-named because it started with six teams from the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, which are next to the Pacific Ocean. Today, the league has 16\u00A0teams across 11\u00A0states from California to Tennessee, and from Washington to Texas.\nStarted in 1903, the PCL was a popular baseball league in the Western United States until 1958 when MLB teams moved there and MLB games began to be shown on television.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_league_baseball","surface_form":"minor league baseball","offset":49},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":85},{"uri":"International_League","surface_form":"International League","offset":109},{"uri":"Mexican_League","surface_form":"Mexican League","offset":138},{"uri":"Triple-A_(baseball)","surface_form":"Triple-A","offset":175},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":223},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"states","offset":311},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":321},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"Oregon","offset":333},{"uri":"Washington_(state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":345},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":379},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":461},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":495},{"uri":"Western_United_States","surface_form":"Western United States","offset":564},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":659}]}
