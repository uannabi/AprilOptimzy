{"id":759017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Schwarzschild metric was calculated by Karl Schwarzschild as a solution to Einstein's field equations in 1916. Also known as Schwarzschild solution, it is an equation from general relativity in the field of astrophysics. A \"metric\" refers to an equation which describes spacetime; in particular, a Schwarzschild metric describes the gravitational field around a Schwarzschild black hole - a non-rotating, spherical black hole with no magnetic field, and where the cosmological constant is zero.\nIt is essentially an equation that describes how a particle moves through the space near a black hole.\nformula_1\nDerivation.\nformula_1 (1)\nv is the velocity of the particle\nG is the gravitational constant\nM is the mass of the black hole\nr is how close the particle is to the heavy object\nformula_1 (2)\nformula_1 (3)\ndt' is the particle's true change in time\ndt is the particle's change in time\ndr' is the true distance traveled\ndr is the particle's change in distance\nv is the velocity of the particle\nc is the speed of light\nNote: the true time interval and true distance traveled by the particle are different than the time and distance calculated in classical physics calculations, since it is traveling in such a heavy gravitational field!\nformula_1 (4)\nds is the path of the particle\nformula_1 is the angle\ndformula_1 and dformula_1 are the change in angles\nInputting the equations for escape velocity, time dilation, and length contraction (equations 1, 2, and 3) into the equation for flat spacetime (equation 4), to get the\nformula_1 (5)\nFrom this equation we can take out the Schwarzschild radius (formula_1), the radius of this black hole. Although this is most commonly used to describe a Schwarzschild black hole, the Schwarzschild radius can be calculated for any heavy object.\nformula_1 (6)\nformula_1 is the set radius limit of the object","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Karl_Schwarzschild","surface_form":"Karl Schwarzschild","offset":56},{"uri":"Einstein_field_equations","surface_form":"Einstein's field equations","offset":92},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":189},{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysics","offset":224},{"uri":"Spacetime","surface_form":"spacetime","offset":287},{"uri":"Gravitational_field","surface_form":"gravitational field","offset":350},{"uri":"Schwarzschild_black_hole","surface_form":"Schwarzschild black hole","offset":379},{"uri":"Rotating","surface_form":"rotating","offset":412},{"uri":"Spherical","surface_form":"spherical","offset":422},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":432},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":451},{"uri":"Cosmological_constant","surface_form":"cosmological constant","offset":481},{"uri":"Gravitational_constant","surface_form":"gravitational constant","offset":694},{"uri":"Time_dilation","surface_form":"true change in time","offset":850},{"uri":"Lorentz_contraction","surface_form":"true distance","offset":917},{"uri":"Speed_of_light","surface_form":"speed of light","offset":1023},{"uri":"Classical_mechanics","surface_form":"classical physics","offset":1165},{"uri":"Schwarzschild_radius","surface_form":"Schwarzschild radius","offset":1597},{"uri":"Schwarzschild_radius","surface_form":"set radius limit","offset":1834}]}
