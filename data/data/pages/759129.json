That was when a woman in her 70s tested positive for the virus. Ecuador was described in April as the growing \"epicentre\" of the pandemic in Latin America.\nDeaths.\nThe city of Guayaquil has had so many deaths that bodies are being left in the street. Ecuador gave out cardboard coffins because the country had diffculty removing all the dead bodies. The government was planning to build emergency cemeteries to dispose of the bodies which are left in the streets.\nNumbers.\nThe number of deaths was believed to be higher than the official figure because not enough testing was being done. A \"New York Times\" analysis found 7,600 more deaths had happened from 1 March to 15 April as the mortality rate spiked to three times as much as usual. That showed that the official death toll was lower than the actual death toll.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"COVID-19 pandemic","offset":4},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":53},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":223},{"uri":"Guayaquil","surface_form":"Guayaquil","offset":258},{"uri":"New_York_Times","surface_form":"New York Times","offset":673}]}
