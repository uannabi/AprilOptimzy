The season lasts all year, although most tropical cyclones form between May and October. The season's first tropical cyclone formed on May 10, making it the sixth-latest start in the basin on record.\nTyphoon Vongfong (Ambo), the season\u2019s first storm, became a Category 3 typhoon and struck the Philippines, causing extensive damages during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSeason summary.\nThe first few months of 2020 were extremely quiet, with no tropical systems developing between the months of January and April. On May 10, the season saw its first tropical system with the development of Ambo, making it the sixth-latest starting season on record, as well as the latest since 2016. Two days later, the system strengthened to the first officially named tropical storm of the season, Vongfong. Vongfong then hit the Philippines at peak intensity, and weakened soon after landfall.\nAfter Vongfong, a month of inactivity ensued, and on June 10, a new tropical depression formed off the coast of Samar, and was named Butchoy by the PAGASA a day later. Butchoy made landfall in the Philippines as the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for it. It then got upgraded to a tropical storm, and impacted Hong Kong, Macau and parts of China upon landfall.\nTyphoon Vongfong.\nA low-pressure area near Micronesia slowly organized over the course of a few hours, and developed into a tropical depression soon after. It became the first tropical cyclone to form in the Western Pacific in 2020, and PAGASA named it \"Ambo\". Favourable sea temperatures, low wind shear and excellent vertical outflow made the system intensify into a tropical storm, then the JMA named it \"Vongfong\".\nLess than a day later, when convection started to rapidly organize around the storm's center, and a well-defined rain band at the northwest side of the storm, JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon. Vongfong made landfall on Samar Island at around 12 PM Philippines Time. It began to weaken because of many landfalls over the Philippines, and emerged into the South China Sea on May 17. It turned north and dissipated due to high wind shear the next day, just south of Taiwan.\nTropical Depression.\nThe JMA classified a tropical low east of the Philippines as a tropical depression on June 10.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"PAGASA","surface_form":"PAGASA","offset":1124},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":1173},{"uri":"JTWC","surface_form":"JTWC","offset":1192},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":1302},{"uri":"Macau","surface_form":"Macau","offset":1313},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1332}]}
