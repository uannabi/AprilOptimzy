{"id":759143,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order","text":"e=\"preserve\">A stay-at-home order (North America) or a movement control order (Southeast Asia) is an order from a government to lower/end movements of a population as a mass quarantine move for stopping an epidemic, or pandemic. This is done by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or to work in essential businesses.\nIn many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Nonessential businesses are either closed or made to working from home.\nIn some regions, it has added a curfew or called a shelter-in-place order, but it is not to be confused with a shelter in place situation.\nSimilar measures have been used around the world, but the term lockdown is used instead.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quarantine","surface_form":"quarantine","offset":174},{"uri":"Epidemic","surface_form":"epidemic","offset":206},{"uri":"Pandemic","surface_form":"pandemic","offset":219},{"uri":"Curfew","surface_form":"curfew","offset":491},{"uri":"Shelter_in_place","surface_form":"shelter in place","offset":570}]}
