{"id":75917,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium_(group)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Aquarium (\u0410\u043A\u0432\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0438\u0443\u043C in Russian) is a Russian rock band. It was formed in Leningrad in 1972 by Boris Grebenshchikov and Anatoly \"George\" Gunitsky.\nUntil 1987 Aquarium recorded all of their albums in a self-assembled underground studio. Despite those hard conditions, the recording quality was rather high and Aquarium's albums between 1980 and 1987 are considered by most fans as their best.\nIn 1987 they recorded their first album for the state-owned Melodiya record label. With official backing and legalized distribution the album was a hit in USSR, selling well over a million copies within a few months. Aquarium today consists of Boris Grebenshchikov, Boris Rubekin (keyboards), Andrey Surotdinov (violin), Igor Timofeyev (guitars, saxophones and flutes), Andrey Svetlov (bass), Oleg \"Shar\" Shavkunov (drums and percussion).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":50},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":58},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":63},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Leningrad","offset":86},{"uri":"1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":99},{"uri":"Boris_Grebenshchikov","surface_form":"Boris Grebenshchikov","offset":107},{"uri":"1987","surface_form":"1987","offset":407},{"uri":"Melodiya","surface_form":"Melodiya","offset":464}]}
