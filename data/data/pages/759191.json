{"id":759191,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.Flash","text":"The V.Flash (known as V.Smile Pro in Europe; stylized as V.FLASH HOME EDUTAINMENT SYSTEM) is a seventh-generation educational home video game console. It is a spinoff of the V.Smile series of video game consoles and was manufactured and released by VTech. Unlike the V.Smile, the game console uses 3D graphics and is designed for kids aged 5+.\nIt was revealed at the 2006 London Toy Fair, and came out in September 2006.\nGames.\nNot many games were made for the console because it was not very successful. All games came out in the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, except for of Bratz Fashion Pixiez: The Secret Necklace, which did not come out in the United Kingdom and Germany, Multisports, which was exclusive to Germany, and Scooby-Doo!: Ancient Adventure, which did not come out in Germany.\nThere are 10 titles known to have been released;\nCDs.\nUnlike most other consoles that use CD-ROMs, this system's CD-ROMs are inside a plastic case to protect them from damage from touching, similar to 3.5\" floppy disks or UMDs. The discs use the ISO 9660 file system, without any copy protection other than a simple sensor in the case jacket, making it possible to make a disc image from the disc. However, there are no known cases of piracy involving the V.Flash. Because of this, the V.Flash can also play audio CDs and user-recorded CD-Rs using the disc adapter that comes with the console.\nOther hardware.\nThe console's CPU is an ARM9 CPU from LSI Logic. Files are stored in 3 main formats:.mjp.ptx, and.snd..snd files are actually PCM WAV files.\nThe console can render 1.5 million polygons per second and has a 32 bit CPU, making the console directly comparable to fifth-generation game consoles, such as the PlayStation.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Video game system"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":37},{"uri":"History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)","surface_form":"seventh-generation","offset":95},{"uri":"Educational_video_game","surface_form":"educational","offset":114},{"uri":"Home_video_game_console","surface_form":"home video game console","offset":126},{"uri":"Video_game_console","surface_form":"video game consoles","offset":192},{"uri":"VTech","surface_form":"VTech","offset":249},{"uri":"3D","surface_form":"3D graphics","offset":298},{"uri":"2006_in_video_games","surface_form":"2006","offset":415},{"uri":"Video_game_consoles","surface_form":"consoles","offset":896},{"uri":"CD-ROM","surface_form":"CD-ROM","offset":914},{"uri":"CD-ROM","surface_form":"CD-ROM","offset":937},{"uri":"Floppy_disks","surface_form":"floppy disks","offset":1030},{"uri":"Universal_Media_Disc","surface_form":"UMDs","offset":1046},{"uri":"International_Organization_for_Standardization","surface_form":"ISO 9660","offset":1070},{"uri":"Copy_protection","surface_form":"copy protection","offset":1104},{"uri":"Disc_image","surface_form":"disc image","offset":1196},{"uri":"Software_piracy","surface_form":"piracy","offset":1259},{"uri":"Compact_Disc","surface_form":"audio CD","offset":1332},{"uri":"CD-R","surface_form":"CD-R","offset":1360},{"uri":"ARM_architecture","surface_form":"ARM9","offset":1458},{"uri":"LSI_Logic","surface_form":"LSI Logic","offset":1472},{"uri":"Pulse-code_modulation","surface_form":"PCM","offset":1560},{"uri":"PlayStation_(console)","surface_form":"PlayStation","offset":1738}]}
