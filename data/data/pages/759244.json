They also confirmed their first death, a 67-year-old Suleiman Achimugu.\nEconomics.\nNigeria is Africa's largest economy, and it has a large oil industry. It was hit hard when oil prices fell below zero in spring 2020 because of the pandemic.\nAccording to the World Data Lab, the coronavirus pandemic is bad for Africa's middle class. According to one economist from the Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank, a middle-class person is someone who is not rich but does have a steady income. One of the industries that has helped Africa's middle class rise over the past 30 years is tourism, and many countries closed borders and encouraged people not to travel. Experts say this is especially bad because a strong middle class lifts the whole country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"COVID-19 pandemic","offset":41},{"uri":"Nigeria","surface_form":"Nigeria","offset":62},{"uri":"Lagos","surface_form":"Lagos","offset":132},{"uri":"Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2","surface_form":"SARS-CoV-2","offset":168},{"uri":"Ewekoro","surface_form":"Ewekoro","offset":241},{"uri":"Ogun_State","surface_form":"Ogun State","offset":250},{"uri":"Edo_State","surface_form":"Edo State","offset":413}]}
