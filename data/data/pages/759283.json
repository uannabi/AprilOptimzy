Neither of the two had traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection. Two other samples in Pleven and Gabrovo were positive on 8 March.\nResponse.\nAfter the number of patients in the country had reached 23, the Bulgarian Parliament voted unanimously to declare a state of emergency from 13 March until 13 April.\nA 14-day preventive house quarantine was made for citizens who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient or have returned from an overseas region with a high number of cases.\nFor patients tested positive for the virus a 21-day house quarantine was created. The National Crisis-management Staff later increased the recovery house quarantine by a week to 28 days. With the continuing increase of COVID-19 cases on a daily basis, on 1 April the Bulgarian government requested that Parliament extends the state of emergency by one month until 13 May.\nNumbers.\nAs of 14 May 2020, there are 2,100 officially confirmed cases spread throughout all Bulgarian provinces, with 99 recorded deaths and 521 recoveries.
