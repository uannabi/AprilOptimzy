Two more episodes that were not shown on television will be on the DVD collection of episodes.\nThe Story.\nIn \"Dollhouse\", Eliza Dushku plays a young woman named Echo. She is one of a group of men and women who can have \"personality packages\" put into their minds. These packages can include many things, for example, memory, skills, language and muscle memory. These people live in a futuristic dormitory/laboratory named the \"Dollhouse\". They are given special personas as part of the personality packages. These are used to do many different types of assignments. For example, the jobs could be romantic, adventurous, strange, or illegal. After the assignment, the information is removed from their minds and they are left in a child-like state with no memories. The series follows Echo as she begins to remember things even though her mind is constantly being erased and new memories implanted into it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":29},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":38},{"uri":"Screenwriter","surface_form":"written","offset":71},{"uri":"Movie_producer","surface_form":"producer","offset":82},{"uri":"Joss_Whedon","surface_form":"Joss Whedon","offset":91},{"uri":"Eliza_Dushku","surface_form":"Eliza Dushku","offset":113},{"uri":"Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer","surface_form":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","offset":192},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"Angel","offset":244},{"uri":"Tim_Minear","surface_form":"Tim Minear","offset":252},{"uri":"Production","surface_form":"made","offset":337},{"uri":"20th_Century_Fox_Television","surface_form":"20th Century Fox Television","offset":345},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":460},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":676},{"uri":"Memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":736},{"uri":"Skill","surface_form":"skill","offset":744},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":752},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscle","offset":765},{"uri":"Future","surface_form":"futuristic","offset":803},{"uri":"Dormitory","surface_form":"dormitory","offset":814},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":824},{"uri":"Job","surface_form":"assignments","offset":972},{"uri":"Romance_(love)","surface_form":"romantic","offset":1016},{"uri":"Adventure","surface_form":"adventurous","offset":1026},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"illegal","offset":1051},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":1149}]}
