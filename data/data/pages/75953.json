{"id":75953,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension","text":"=\"preserve\">Right ascension (abbreviated RA; symbol \u03B1) is the astronomical word for one of the two coordinates of a point on the celestial sphere when using the equatorial coordinate system. It is the celestial counterpart to longitude. The other coordinate is the declination.\nThe moon, planets and stars all have their own right ascension. Many of them are listed in an almanac. Using arithmetic, the object\u2019s right ascension and declination indicate where to look in the sky to see the object.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomical","offset":62},{"uri":"Coordinate","surface_form":"coordinate","offset":99},{"uri":"Celestial_sphere","surface_form":"celestial sphere","offset":129},{"uri":"Equatorial_coordinate_system","surface_form":"equatorial coordinate system","offset":161},{"uri":"Longitude","surface_form":"longitude","offset":226},{"uri":"Declination","surface_form":"declination","offset":265},{"uri":"Almanac","surface_form":"almanac","offset":372}]}
