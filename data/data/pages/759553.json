It is an alternative to the gender binary in homosexual and heterosexual. Androphilia is attraction to a man or masculinity (any quality or behavior linked to a man). Gynephilia is attraction to a woman or femininity. Ambiphilia (bisexuality) is the combination of androphilia and gynephilia.\nThe terms describe the focus of attraction with no need to credit a sex assignment or gender identity to the person. It will skirt any difficulty to understand people between the West and the East. The terms will also describe intersex and transgender people.\nAndrophilia.\nMagnus Hirschfeld was an early 1900s German sexologist (expert in sex and sexuality). Hirschfeld put a homosexual man in one of four groups. A man with attraction to a boy (pedophile). A man with attraction to an adolescent boy (ephebophile). A man with attraction to another young man (androphile). A man with attraction to an old man (gerontophile).\n\"Androphilia, A Manifesto: Rejecting the Gay Identity, Reclaiming Masculinity\" is a book by Jack Donovan. Donovan uses \"androphilia\" to focus on masculinity in male homosexual desire. He also uses the term to reject the femininity and androgyny (combination of masculinity and femininity) in some parts of homosexual life.\n\"Androsexuality\" is the same as \"androphilia\".\nAlternative use in biology and medicine\n\"Androphilic\" the same as \"anthropophilic\" in biology\". Anthropophilic\" is a parasite who will desire a human more than an animal. \"Androphilic\" will also describe certain proteins and androgen receptors.\nGynephilia.\nIn Ancient Greek, there is a different form of the term. In \"Idyll\" 8, line 60, Theocritus uses \"gynaikophilias\" to describe the very strong desire Zeus has for any woman.\nSigmund Freud says \"gynecophilic\" to describe his case study (detailed study of one person) Dora. Freud also uses the term in writing.\n\"Gynesexuality\" is the same as \"gynephilia\". Psychoanalyst Nancy Chodorow says the short preoedipal (attraction to the mother and jealousy of the father) time of focus on the mother should be named \"gynesexuality\" or \"matrisexuality.\"\nAttraction.\n\"Androphilia\" and \"gynephilia\" separate group attraction based on how old a person is. John Money names this chronophilia. Attraction to an adult is teleiophilia or adultophilia. Here, \"androphilia\" and \"gynephilia\" mean \"attraction to an adult male\" and \"attraction to an adult female.\"\nAndrophilia and gynephilia scales.\nKurt Freund and Betty Steiner create the 9-item Gynephilia Scale and the 13-item Androphilia Scale in 1982. This measures attraction in a mature female or a mature male. In 1985, Ray Blanchard names a new one the Modified Androphilia-Gynephilia Index (MAGI).\nGender identity and behavior.\nMagnus Hirschfeld sorts between gynephilic, bisexual, androphilic, asexual, and automonosexual (sexual attraction to themselves only) transgender woman.\nSince the middle of the 1900s, some psychologists like to use \"homosexual transsexual\" (to mean the same as straight transgender woman) and \"heterosexual transsexual\" (to mean the same as transgender lesbian). Biologist Bruce Bagemihl is against this. It is because Bageminl thought it makes it simple to say a transsexual is a homosexual male looking to run from stigma. The term \"homosexual transsexual\" is \"heterosexist\" because it describes people by sex assignment and not gender identity. Sexologist John Bancroft says he regrets using this language. It was normal at the time Bancroft used it to talk about transgender women. Since 2008, he attempts to use terms that do not hurt the feelings of anyone. Sexologist Charles Allen Moser is also against any terms like that.\nSexologist Militon Diamond supports the terms androphilic, gynecophilic, and ambiphilic to describe any partner a person desires (andro = male, gyneco = female, ambi = both, philic = to love).\nGender in the East.\nSome scientists support use of the terms to skirt bias in concepts of human sexuality in the West. Johanna Schmidt says that in a society where a third gender is supported, a term like \"homosexual transsexual\" does not line up.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Behavioral_science","surface_form":"behavioral science","offset":54},{"uri":"Sexual_orientation","surface_form":"sexual orientation","offset":128},{"uri":"Gender_binary","surface_form":"gender binary","offset":176},{"uri":"Homosexuality","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":193},{"uri":"Heterosexuality","surface_form":"heterosexual","offset":208},{"uri":"Femininity","surface_form":"femininity","offset":354},{"uri":"Bisexuality","surface_form":"bisexuality","offset":378},{"uri":"Sex_assignment","surface_form":"sex assignment","offset":509},{"uri":"Gender_identity","surface_form":"gender identity","offset":527},{"uri":"Western_civilization","surface_form":"West","offset":620},{"uri":"Eastern_world","surface_form":"East","offset":633},{"uri":"Intersexuality","surface_form":"intersex","offset":668},{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"transgender","offset":681},{"uri":"Magnus_Hirschfeld","surface_form":"Magnus Hirschfeld","offset":714},{"uri":"Pedophilia","surface_form":"pedophile","offset":887},{"uri":"Adolescent","surface_form":"adolescent","offset":927},{"uri":"Ephebophilia","surface_form":"ephebophile","offset":943},{"uri":"Gerontophilia","surface_form":"gerontophile","offset":1051},{"uri":"Reject","surface_form":"reject","offset":1275},{"uri":"Androgyny","surface_form":"androgyny","offset":1301},{"uri":"Anthropophilia","surface_form":"anthropophilic","offset":1503},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":1522},{"uri":"Parasitism","surface_form":"parasite","offset":1553},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":1648},{"uri":"Androgen_receptor","surface_form":"androgen receptor","offset":1661},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":1696},{"uri":"Idyll","surface_form":"Idyll","offset":1754},{"uri":"Theocritus","surface_form":"Theocritus","offset":1773},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":1841},{"uri":"Sigmund_Freud","surface_form":"Sigmund Freud","offset":1865},{"uri":"Case_study","surface_form":"case study","offset":1915},{"uri":"Dora_(case_study)","surface_form":"Dora","offset":1957},{"uri":"Psychoanalysis","surface_form":"Psychoanalyst","offset":2045},{"uri":"Nancy_Chodorow","surface_form":"Nancy Chodorow","offset":2059},{"uri":"Oedipus_complex","surface_form":"preoedipal","offset":2089},{"uri":"John_Money","surface_form":"John Money","offset":2334},{"uri":"Chronophilia","surface_form":"chronophilia","offset":2356},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":2387},{"uri":"Kurt_Freund","surface_form":"Kurt Freund","offset":2570},{"uri":"Betty_Steiner","surface_form":"Betty Steiner","offset":2586},{"uri":"Ray_Blanchard","surface_form":"Ray Blanchard","offset":2749},{"uri":"Asexuality","surface_form":"asexual","offset":2926},{"uri":"Themselves","surface_form":"themselves","offset":2976},{"uri":"Psychologist","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":3048},{"uri":"Heterosexuality","surface_form":"straight","offset":3120},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":3212},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"Biologist","offset":3222},{"uri":"Bruce_Bagemihl","surface_form":"Bruce Bagemihl","offset":3232},{"uri":"Social_stigma","surface_form":"stigma","offset":3376},{"uri":"Heterosexism","surface_form":"heterosexist","offset":3422},{"uri":"John_Bancroft","surface_form":"John Bancroft","offset":3518},{"uri":"Charles_Allen_Moser","surface_form":"Charles Allen Moser","offset":3734},{"uri":"Militon_Diamond","surface_form":"Militon Diamond","offset":3802},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":4009},{"uri":"Human_sexuality","surface_form":"sexuality","offset":4080}]}
