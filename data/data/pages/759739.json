These three events together make up the \"Triple Crown Series\". Each individual tournament is called a Triple Crown event. Players who win all three tournaments are said to have \"won the Triple Crown\", either over their career, or in one season alone. The Triple Crown dates back to the 1969 World Snooker Championship, when the event changed reverted to a knockout format from the prior \"challenge\" basis.\n, 11 players have won all three events. Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan won each event five times or more. O'Sullivan has the most titles, having won 19 individual tournaments. Three players have won all three in the space of a season.
