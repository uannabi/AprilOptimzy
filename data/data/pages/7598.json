{"id":7598,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker","text":"A marker is a writing device that allows a person to draw, write, or scribble. Ink comes out of the tip of the marker and onto the writing surface, commonly a piece of paper. Markers generally come in a variety of different colors. They are sometimes referred to as \"magic markers\", or magic pens.\nThe tip of the marker where ink comes out from is usually made of cloth. This allows the ink to go through easily. A lot of ink can come out from it at one time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ink","surface_form":"Ink","offset":79},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":168},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":224},{"uri":"Magic_marker","surface_form":"magic marker","offset":267}]}
