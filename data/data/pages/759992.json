She is best known for Native American rights activism. On March 27, 1973, she stood in for Marlon Brando at the 45th Academy Awards to turn down the Best Actor award for his performance in \"The Godfather\". Brando did not go to the ceremony in protest of Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans and to bring attention to the standoff at Wounded Knee. Her speech was met with both jeers and an applause.\nLittlefeather was born in Salinas, California. Her mother was of French, German and Dutch ancestry. Her father was a Native American (both White Mountain Apache and Yaqui). In 2018, a spokesperson announced that Littlefeather had stage 4 breast cancer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":102},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","surface_form":"Native American","offset":155},{"uri":"Marlon_Brando","surface_form":"Marlon Brando","offset":224},{"uri":"45th_Academy_Awards","surface_form":"45th Academy Awards","offset":245},{"uri":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor","surface_form":"Best Actor","offset":282},{"uri":"The_Godfather","surface_form":"The Godfather","offset":323},{"uri":"Native_Americans_in_film","surface_form":"Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans","offset":387},{"uri":"Wounded_Knee_incident","surface_form":"standoff at Wounded Knee","offset":459},{"uri":"Applause","surface_form":"applause","offset":527},{"uri":"Salinas%2C_California","surface_form":"Salinas, California","offset":563},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":602},{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":610},{"uri":"Dutch_people","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":621},{"uri":"Ancestry","surface_form":"ancestry","offset":627},{"uri":"Fort_Apache_Indian_Reservation","surface_form":"White Mountain Apache","offset":676},{"uri":"Yaqui","surface_form":"Yaqui","offset":702},{"uri":"Breast_cancer","surface_form":"breast cancer","offset":775}]}
