{"id":76007,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal_River","text":"The Senegal River is a river in West Africa. It is 1,800 km long and is the border between Senegal and Mauritania. Pliny the Elder called it \"Bambotus\" (from a word meaning \"hippopotamus\") and Claudius Ptolemy called it \"Nias\". Hanno the Carthaginian went to the river in about 450 BC when he was going from Carthage to Mount Cameroon in the Gulf of Guinea. Carthage was destroyed in 146 BC, but before that time there was probably trade from here to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe Semef\u00E9 River and Bafing River meet in Bafoulab\u00E9 and this forms the Senegal River. The Semef\u00E9 and Bafing rivers' sources are in Guinea. The Bafing River flows through Mali and the Semef\u00E9 is the Mali-Senegal border.\nNear the river's mouth, the Senegal goes through Biffeche and there is an island in the river. The city of Saint-Louis is on this island. The river then turns south. There is a thin line of sand and this separates the river from the Atlantic Ocean. The line of sand is called the Langue de Barbarie. After this, the river enters the Atlantic Ocean. The river has two large dams: the Manantali Dam in Mali, and the Maka-Diama Dam on the Mauritania-Senegal border, near the sea. The Manantali Dam makes a reservoir. The Maka-Diama Dam stops salt water going deep into the countryside.\nThe Senegal River takes its water from 483,181 km\u00B2 of land. About 8 000 000 km\u00B3 of water goes along the river every year. The Faleme River, Karakoro River, and Gorgol River join the Senegal River.\nIn 1972, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal made the Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve S\u00E9n\u00E9gal (OMVS). This organisation manages the land around the river. Guinea joined this organisation in 2005.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":23},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":37},{"uri":"Km","surface_form":"km","offset":57},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":91},{"uri":"Mauritania","surface_form":"Mauritania","offset":103},{"uri":"Pliny_the_Elder","surface_form":"Pliny the Elder","offset":115},{"uri":"Hippopotamus","surface_form":"hippopotamus","offset":174},{"uri":"Claudius_Ptolemy","surface_form":"Claudius Ptolemy","offset":193},{"uri":"Hanno_the_Carthaginian","surface_form":"Hanno the Carthaginian","offset":228},{"uri":"450_BC","surface_form":"450 BC","offset":278},{"uri":"Carthage","surface_form":"Carthage","offset":308},{"uri":"Mount_Cameroon","surface_form":"Mount Cameroon","offset":320},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Guinea","surface_form":"Gulf of Guinea","offset":342},{"uri":"Carthage","surface_form":"Carthage","offset":358},{"uri":"146_BC","surface_form":"146 BC","offset":384},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":455},{"uri":"Semef%C3%A9_River","surface_form":"Semef\u00E9 River","offset":478},{"uri":"Bafing_River","surface_form":"Bafing River","offset":495},{"uri":"Bafoulab%C3%A9","surface_form":"Bafoulab\u00E9","offset":516},{"uri":"Semef%C3%A9_River","surface_form":"Semef\u00E9","offset":564},{"uri":"Bafing_River","surface_form":"Bafing","offset":575},{"uri":"Guinea","surface_form":"Guinea","offset":605},{"uri":"Bafing_River","surface_form":"Bafing River","offset":617},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":644},{"uri":"Semef%C3%A9_River","surface_form":"Semef\u00E9","offset":657},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":671},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":676},{"uri":"Biffeche","surface_form":"Biffeche","offset":741},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":766},{"uri":"Saint-Louis%2C_Senegal","surface_form":"Saint-Louis","offset":799},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":822},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":851},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":882},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":925},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":953},{"uri":"Langue_de_Barbarie","surface_form":"Langue de Barbarie","offset":972},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":1025},{"uri":"Dam","surface_form":"dam","offset":1065},{"uri":"Manantali_Dam","surface_form":"Manantali Dam","offset":1075},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":1092},{"uri":"Maka-Diama_Dam","surface_form":"Maka-Diama Dam","offset":1106},{"uri":"Mauritania","surface_form":"Mauritania","offset":1128},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":1139},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":1164},{"uri":"Manantali_Dam","surface_form":"Manantali Dam","offset":1173},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":1195},{"uri":"Maka-Diama_Dam","surface_form":"Maka-Diama Dam","offset":1210},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1303},{"uri":"Km%C2%B2","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":1322},{"uri":"Km%C2%B3","surface_form":"km\u00B3","offset":1351},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1358},{"uri":"Faleme_River","surface_form":"Faleme River","offset":1401},{"uri":"Karakoro_River","surface_form":"Karakoro River","offset":1415},{"uri":"Gorgol_River","surface_form":"Gorgol River","offset":1435},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":1481},{"uri":"Mauritania","surface_form":"Mauritania","offset":1487},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":1502},{"uri":"Organisation_pour_la_mise_en_valeur_du_fleuve_S%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal","surface_form":"Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve S\u00E9n\u00E9gal","offset":1519},{"uri":"Guinea","surface_form":"Guinea","offset":1634},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":1669}]}
