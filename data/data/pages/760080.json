ALF was performed by puppeteer Paul Fusco, who co-created the show with Tom Patchett.\n\"ALF\" originally ran for four seasons and made 99 episodes. The series ended with an unresolved cliffhanger, but the later TV movie, \"Project ALF\", gave a series finale for the franchise.\nIn August 2018, Warner Bros. Television announced development of an \"ALF\" reboot. These plans were cancelled in November 2018.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sitcom","surface_form":"sitcom","offset":21},{"uri":"NBC","surface_form":"NBC","offset":60},{"uri":"Alien","surface_form":"alien","offset":169},{"uri":"Max_Wright","surface_form":"Max Wright","offset":281},{"uri":"Anne_Schedeen","surface_form":"Anne Schedeen","offset":317},{"uri":"Andrea_Elson","surface_form":"Andrea Elson","offset":358},{"uri":"Benji_Gregory","surface_form":"Benji Gregory","offset":375},{"uri":"Paul_Fusco","surface_form":"Paul Fusco","offset":462},{"uri":"Tom_Patchett","surface_form":"Tom Patchett","offset":503},{"uri":"TV_movie","surface_form":"TV movie","offset":640},{"uri":"Project_ALF","surface_form":"Project ALF","offset":651},{"uri":"Series_finale","surface_form":"series finale","offset":672}]}
