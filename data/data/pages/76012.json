{"id":76012,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscidea","text":"Proboscidea (meaning \"trunked beast\") is an order containing only one familiy of living animals, Elephantidae, the elephants, with three living species (African forest elephant, African bush elephant, and Asian elephant).\nDuring the period of the last ice age there were more, now extinct species, including a number of species of the elephant-like mammoths and mastodons.\nThe oldest proboscidean dates from the early Palaeogene period, over 50 million years ago. The evolution of the elephant-like animals mainly concerned the proportions of the cranium and jaw and the shape of the tusks and molar teeth.\nFamilies.\nPresent-day elephants are the survivors of a once larger and more varied family.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":44},{"uri":"Elephant","surface_form":"elephant","offset":115},{"uri":"African_forest_elephant","surface_form":"African forest elephant","offset":153},{"uri":"African_bush_elephant","surface_form":"African bush elephant","offset":178},{"uri":"Asian_elephant","surface_form":"Asian elephant","offset":205},{"uri":"Mammoth","surface_form":"mammoth","offset":349},{"uri":"Mastodon","surface_form":"mastodon","offset":362},{"uri":"Palaeogene","surface_form":"Palaeogene","offset":418},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":559},{"uri":"Tusk","surface_form":"tusk","offset":584},{"uri":"Molar","surface_form":"molar","offset":594}]}
