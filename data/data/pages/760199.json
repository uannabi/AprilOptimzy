{"id":760199,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-One_but_You_(Only_the_Good_Die_Young)","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"No-One But You (Only the Good Die Young)\" is the only song recorded by the remaining three members of the British rock band Queen in 1997 following the death of the lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991.\nGuitarist Brian May\u2014the writer of the song\u2014and drummer Roger Taylor share lead vocals. The song was released on the album \"Queen Rocks\" and it was also released as a double a-side single with \"Tie Your Mother Down\".\nThe song came after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in August 1997, but is largely a eulogy to Freddie Mercury. It was dedicated to Mercury and all those who die too soon. It was originally written for a potential Brian May solo project. He sent the demo of the song to Roger Taylor and forgot about it.\nIncluded in Queen\u2019s \"Greatest Hits III\", the song featured only the remaining three members of the band. This was also the last recording to feature bass guitarist John Deacon, who retired from public life. This was the last original Queen release until the 2014 release \"Queen Forever\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Queen_(band)","surface_form":"Queen","offset":138},{"uri":"Freddie_Mercury","surface_form":"Freddie Mercury","offset":191},{"uri":"Brian_May","surface_form":"Brian May","offset":226},{"uri":"Roger_Taylor","surface_form":"Roger Taylor","offset":271},{"uri":"Queen_Rocks","surface_form":"Queen Rocks","offset":339},{"uri":"Tie_Your_Mother_Down","surface_form":"Tie Your Mother Down","offset":409},{"uri":"Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales","surface_form":"Diana, Princess of Wales","offset":465},{"uri":"Eulogy","surface_form":"eulogy","offset":523},{"uri":"Demo_(music)","surface_form":"demo","offset":688},{"uri":"Greatest_Hits_III_(Queen_album)","surface_form":"Greatest Hits III","offset":763},{"uri":"John_Deacon","surface_form":"John Deacon","offset":906},{"uri":"Queen_Forever","surface_form":"Queen Forever","offset":1014}]}
