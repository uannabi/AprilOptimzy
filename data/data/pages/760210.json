{"id":760210,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebenezer_Scrooge","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ebenezer Scrooge () is the main character of Charles Dickens' 1843 novel, \"A Christmas Carol\".\nAt the beginning of the novel, Scrooge is a cold-hearted mean businessman who hates Christmas. He is soon visited by three spirits (the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come) in hopes to save him from going to hell.\nScrooge's last name has become byword for selfish or not being generous, while his catchphrase, \"Bah! Humbug!\" is often used to show hatred towards Christmas traditions.\nHe was inspired by a Dutch gravedigger.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Charles_Dickens","surface_form":"Charles Dickens","offset":58},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":80},{"uri":"A_Christmas_Carol","surface_form":"A Christmas Carol","offset":88},{"uri":"Ghost_of_Christmas_Past","surface_form":"Ghost of Christmas Past","offset":244},{"uri":"Ghost_of_Christmas_Present","surface_form":"Ghost of Christmas Present","offset":273},{"uri":"Ghost_of_Christmas_Yet_to_Come","surface_form":"Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come","offset":309},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"hell","offset":376},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"byword","offset":413},{"uri":"Humbug","surface_form":"Bah!
