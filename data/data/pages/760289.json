{"id":760289,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-sense_single-stranded_RNA_virus","text":"A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (or (+)ssRNA virus) is a virus which has positive sense single stranded RNA as its genetic material. They can be positive or negative. This depends on the polarity of the RNA. The positive-sense viral RNA genome can serve as messenger RNA and can be translated into protein in the host cell.\nMany of the known viruses are positive-sense RNA viruses, including the hepacivirus C, West Nile virus, dengue virus, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2 as well as less serious pathogens such as the rhinoviruses that cause the common cold.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":68},{"uri":"Base_pair","surface_form":"single stranded","offset":99},{"uri":"RNA","surface_form":"RNA","offset":115},{"uri":"Genetic_code","surface_form":"genetic","offset":126},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"positive","offset":156},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"negative","offset":168},{"uri":"Polarity","surface_form":"polarity","offset":198},{"uri":"Messenger_RNA","surface_form":"messenger RNA","offset":268},{"uri":"Translation_(genetics)","surface_form":"translated","offset":293},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":309},{"uri":"Host_(biology)","surface_form":"host cell","offset":324},{"uri":"Hepatitis_C","surface_form":"hepacivirus C","offset":407},{"uri":"West_Nile_virus","surface_form":"West Nile virus","offset":422},{"uri":"Dengue_fever","surface_form":"dengue virus","offset":439},{"uri":"Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome","surface_form":"SARS","offset":453},{"uri":"MERS","surface_form":"MERS","offset":462},{"uri":"Coronavirus","surface_form":"coronaviruses","offset":467},{"uri":"Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2","surface_form":"SARS-CoV-2","offset":486},{"uri":"Pathogens","surface_form":"pathogens","offset":521},{"uri":"Rhinovirus","surface_form":"rhinoviruses","offset":543},{"uri":"Common_cold","surface_form":"common cold","offset":571}]}
