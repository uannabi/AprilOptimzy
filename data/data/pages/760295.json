{"id":760295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronaviridae","text":"\"Coronaviridae\" is a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The viral genome is 26\u201332 kilobases in length. The particles have large (~20\u00A0nm), club- or petal-shaped spikes on the surface (the \"peplomers\"). The particles in electron micrographs look like the solar corona.\nTaxonomy.\nThe family \"Coronaviridae\" is has 2 sub-families, 5 genera, 26 sub-genera, and 46 species. More species are possible, but not yet confirmed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Viral_envelope","surface_form":"enveloped","offset":31},{"uri":"RNA_virus","surface_form":"RNA viruses","offset":74},{"uri":"Genome","surface_form":"genome","offset":97},{"uri":"Base_pair","surface_form":"kilobases","offset":113},{"uri":"Peplomer","surface_form":"peplomers","offset":219},{"uri":"Micrograph","surface_form":"electron micrographs","offset":249},{"uri":"Corona","surface_form":"solar corona","offset":284}]}
