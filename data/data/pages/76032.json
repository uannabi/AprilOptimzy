{"id":76032,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapsid","text":"Therapsids, previously known as the mammal-like reptiles, are an order of synapsids.\nThe clade includes the mammals, which are descended from the cynodont therapsids.\nCharacteristics.\nThe jaws of therapsids had frontal incisors for nipping, large lateral canines for puncturing and tearing, and molars for shearing and tearing, and molars for shearing and chopping food.\nTherapsid legs were positioned more vertically beneath their bodies than were the sprawling legs of Sauropsids and Pelycosaurs.\nEvolution.\nThe therapsids were seriously affected by the Tr extinction event. The successful gorgonopsians died out, and the remaining groups were much reduced.\nThe dicynodonts, now represented by a single family of large stocky herbivores, the Kannemeyeridae, and the medium-sized cynodonts (including both carnivorous and herbivorous forms), flourished worldwide, throughout the early to middle Triassic. They died out across much of Pangea before the end of the Upper Triassic, although they continued for some time longer in the wet equatorial band and the south.\nAt least three groups of eucynodonts survived. They appeared in the Upper Triassic. The extremely mammal-like family, the Tritylodonts, survived into the Lower Cretaceous. Another group, \"Morganucodon\" and similar animals, were mammaliaformes or the \"stem-mammals\" for the mammals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mammal-like_reptile","surface_form":"mammal-like reptile","offset":36},{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":65},{"uri":"Synapsid","surface_form":"synapsid","offset":74},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":89},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":108},{"uri":"Cynodont","surface_form":"cynodont","offset":146},{"uri":"Incisor","surface_form":"incisor","offset":219},{"uri":"Molar","surface_form":"molar","offset":295},{"uri":"Sauropsid","surface_form":"Sauropsid","offset":471},{"uri":"Pelycosaur","surface_form":"Pelycosaur","offset":486},{"uri":"Tr_extinction_event","surface_form":"Tr extinction event","offset":556},{"uri":"Gorgonopsia","surface_form":"gorgonopsia","offset":592},{"uri":"Dicynodont","surface_form":"dicynodont","offset":664},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":896},{"uri":"Pangea","surface_form":"Pangea","offset":935},{"uri":"Upper_Triassic","surface_form":"Upper Triassic","offset":1135},{"uri":"Tritylodont","surface_form":"Tritylodont","offset":1189},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":1221},{"uri":"Morganucodon","surface_form":"Morganucodon","offset":1255},{"uri":"Mammaliaformes","surface_form":"mammaliaformes","offset":1295}]}
