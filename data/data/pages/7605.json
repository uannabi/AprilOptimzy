{"id":7605,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo","text":"S\u00E3o Paulo (Portuguese for \"Saint Paul\") is the capital of the state of S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. It is the biggest city in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe city has an area of 1,523 km\u00B2 and more than 11 million people live there. It is the 11th most populous city on Earth.\nHistory.\nIn January 25, 1554, two priests, Manuel da N\u00F3brega and Jos\u00E9 de Anchieta, built a school - \"Col\u00E9gio de S\u00E3o Paulo de Piratininga\" - to convert natives to Catholic religion. Today, this building is the Padre Anchieta Museum.\nThe first people moved to the region in 1560, when S\u00E3o Paulo became a village.\nBecause S\u00E3o Paulo was a poor village and was far away from the colony centre, the \"bandeirantes\" (explorers) chose it to start expeditions to enslave natives, recapture runaway slaves, and to find precious metals and stones (gold, diamonds, etc.).\nIn 1711, S\u00E3o Paulo became a city. In the end of the 18th century, people started growing sugarcane in the rural area of the province, and S\u00E3o Paulo was the way to the port of Santos.\nIn the 19th century, after the construction of S\u00E3o Paulo's Law School, S\u00E3o Paulo became the capital of the province, politicians and philosophers went there, and the first newspapers and books were printed. At this time, many European immigrants, especially Italians, moved to S\u00E3o Paulo to work at the big coffee plantations.\nAt the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century, the city grew quickly. Some people who study Brazilian History says \"the city was rebuilt\".\nIn the 20th century, many factories were built, and more immigrants moved to work there.\nToday, S\u00E3o Paulo is a centre of commerce, services and technology, and some people consider it the most important Latin American city.\nPolitics.\nThe current mayor of S\u00E3o Paulo is Bruno Covas, and his party is \"Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira\".\nGeography.\nS\u00E3o Paulo is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn. It is in a plateau (a high flat area), 760 metres above the sea level.\nBecause of its altitude, its climate (subtropical) is not so warm as it is near the coast. S\u00E3o Paulo is 70\u00A0km far from the coast, 420\u00A0km far from Rio de Janeiro, and 1,020\u00A0km far from Bras\u00EDlia, the Brazilian capital city.\nThe metropolitan area formed by S\u00E3o Paulo and 39 surroundings cities is the biggest in the Latin America. More than 19 million people live in this metropolitan area, which is also called \"Greater S\u00E3o Paulo\" and is the fifth biggest of the world.\nSubdivisons.\nThe city is divided into 31 boroughs, and each borough is divided into neighbourhoods. The boroughs form nine regions (or \"zones\"), with similar geographic location and history, but most people and companies prefer to use another division, with only five regions.\nEthnic diversity.\nDescendants of many peoples live in S\u00E3o Paulo: Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, African, German, Lebanese, Japanese. There are also descendant of peoples from other South American countries, for example Argentina and Bolivia, and other places, for example Chinese people, Jews, and South Koreans.\nEvery day, people from other cities or states move to S\u00E3o Paulo. Many are people from the Northeast region of Brazil that try to find a job in the city.\nEconomics.\nS\u00E3o Paulo is the commercial and industrial center of Brazil. There are factories and shops of all sizes and kinds. For example, in S\u00E3o Paulo there are some of the more expensive shops of Brazil, but also there are commercial districts formed only by cheap shops, and people from many places (also from other cities) buy clothing, electronics and other products at these districts.\nSports.\nFootball is the sport with the biggest number of fans in the city. The most important clubs from the city are Corinthians, Palmeiras, and S\u00E3o Paulo. They are all playing in the Brazilian S\u00E9rie A, the major football championship in Brazil. Except Palmeiras.\nThere are also other big and medium teams from S\u00E3o Paulo, for example Portuguesa and Juventus, and many small teams. However, Santos FC, that is a club from Santos, a city in the coast, is the fourth team in number of supporters.\nS\u00E3o Paulo also hosts the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix, in Aut\u00F3dromo Jos\u00E9 Carlos Pace (known as Aut\u00F3dromo de Interlagos).\nOther major sports are basketball and volleyball. Some people also play handball, tennis, and other sports.\nTransportation.\nSome people do not like S\u00E3o Paulo because of the big number of cars, trucks and motorcycles on streets and avenues. The public transport is also very important for the people who live there. There are many bus lanes in the city, and a big Metro (underground railway) and railway system.\nS\u00E3o Paulo has three airports and is the second city in number of helicopters of the world (New York City is the first).\nBorn in S\u00E3o Paulo.\nBelow is a list of famous people born in S\u00E3o
