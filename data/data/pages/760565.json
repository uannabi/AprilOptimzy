The movie is based of Victor Hugo's 1869 novel of the same name and stars Mary Philbin as the blind Dea and Conrad Veidt as Gwynplaine. The movie is known for the grim carnival freak-like grin.\nCritic Roger Ebert said, \"The Man Who Laughs\" is a melodrama, at times even a swashbuckler, but so steeped in Expressionist gloom that it plays like a horror film.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Silent","surface_form":"silent","offset":40},{"uri":"Romantic","surface_form":"romantic","offset":47},{"uri":"Drama","surface_form":"drama","offset":56},{"uri":"Paul_Leni","surface_form":"Paul Leni","offset":77},{"uri":"Victor_Hugo","surface_form":"Victor Hugo","offset":110},{"uri":"The_Man_Who_Laughs","surface_form":"same name","offset":142},{"uri":"Mary_Philbin","surface_form":"Mary Philbin","offset":162},{"uri":"Blindness","surface_form":"blind","offset":182},{"uri":"Conrad_Veidt","surface_form":"Conrad Veidt","offset":196},{"uri":"Carnival","surface_form":"carnival","offset":256},{"uri":"Roger_Ebert","surface_form":"Roger Ebert","offset":289},{"uri":"Melodrama","surface_form":"melodrama","offset":333},{"uri":"Swashbuckler_films","surface_form":"swashbuckler","offset":360}]}
