{"id":76088,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinus","text":"e=\"preserve\">In Roman mythology, Quirinus was an early god of the Roman state. In Augustan Rome, Quirinus was also a name of Janus, as \"Janus Quirinus\".\nHistory.\nQuirinus was originally most likely a Sabine god. The Sabines had a settlement near the site of what was to become Rome, and erected an altar to Quirinus on the \"Collis Quirinalis\", the \"Quirinal Hill\", one of the \"Seven Hills of Rome\". When the Romans settled there, they absorbed the cult of Quirinus into their early belief system \u2014 previous to direct Greek influence \u2014 and he was said to be the deified Romulus.\nIn later times, however, Quirinus became far less important, losing his place to (Juno and Minerva and Mars' place).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman mythology","offset":16},{"uri":"Janus","surface_form":"Janus","offset":125},{"uri":"Sabine","surface_form":"Sabine","offset":200},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":277},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"deified","offset":561},{"uri":"Romulus","surface_form":"Romulus","offset":569},{"uri":"Juno_(mythology)","surface_form":"Juno","offset":660},{"uri":"Minerva","surface_form":"Minerva","offset":669},{"uri":"Mars_(mythology)","surface_form":"Mars","offset":681}]}
