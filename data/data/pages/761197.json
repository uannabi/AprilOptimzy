Club\" gave a mostly negative review for the film, but said \"for lovers of utter, unredeemable trash, it is highly recommended.\" CraveOnline also gave a negative review, but said the film should be for \"Bad Movie Night\".\nIn an interview, DeCoteau, talking about the film, said \"people have called me who I haven't seen since high school who said, 'David, after 100 movies you've finally made a movie we like.'\" He added, \"I watched it again, because I hadn't seen it since we made it, and it is so ridiculous and hilarious and over-the-top.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Independent_film","surface_form":"independent","offset":29},{"uri":"Children%27s_film","surface_form":"children's film","offset":41},{"uri":"David_DeCoteau","surface_form":"David DeCoteau","offset":69},{"uri":"Phase_4_Films","surface_form":"Phase 4 Films","offset":110},{"uri":"Direct_to_DVD","surface_form":"direct to DVD","offset":124},{"uri":"Eric_Roberts","surface_form":"Eric Roberts","offset":160},{"uri":"Single-parent_family","surface_form":"families with one parent","offset":232},{"uri":"Eric_Roberts","surface_form":"Eric Roberts","offset":288},{"uri":"Johnny_Whitaker","surface_form":"Johnny Whitaker","offset":337},{"uri":"Kristine_DeBell","surface_form":"Kristine DeBell","offset":531},{"uri":"Caterer","surface_form":"caterer","offset":593},{"uri":"David_DeCoteau","surface_form":"David DeCoteau","offset":866},{"uri":"Eric_Roberts","surface_form":"Eric Roberts","offset":985},{"uri":"Film.com","surface_form":"Film.com","offset":1073},{"uri":"The_A.V._Club","surface_form":"The A.V.
