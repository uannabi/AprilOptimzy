{"id":761367,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula","text":"In complex analysis, Euler's formula, also sometimes called Euler's relation, is an equation involving complex numbers and trigonometric functions. More specifically, it states that\nformula_1\nwhere \"x\" is a real number, \"e\" is Euler's number and \"i\" is the imaginary unit.\nIt makes a relation between trigonometric functions and exponential functions of complex numbers. It is named after Leonhard Euler, who published it in 1748. When he published it, Euler said that the angle must be a real number. Later, it turned out that the formula also works if the angle is not a real number, but a complex one.\nWhen the angle is formula_1 and formula_1, Euler's formula becomes formula_1 and formula_1, respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Complex_analysis","surface_form":"complex analysis","offset":3},{"uri":"Equation","surface_form":"equation","offset":84},{"uri":"Complex_number","surface_form":"complex numbers","offset":103},{"uri":"Trigonometric_function","surface_form":"trigonometric functions","offset":123},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":207},{"uri":"Euler%27s_number","surface_form":"Euler's number","offset":227},{"uri":"Imaginary_unit","surface_form":"imaginary unit","offset":257},{"uri":"Trigonometric_functions","surface_form":"trigonometric functions","offset":301},{"uri":"Exponential_function","surface_form":"exponential functions","offset":329},{"uri":"Complex_numbers","surface_form":"complex numbers","offset":354},{"uri":"Leonhard_Euler","surface_form":"Leonhard Euler","offset":389},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real number","offset":489}]}
