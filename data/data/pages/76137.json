{"id":76137,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona","text":"Toki Pona (in Toki Pona it means \"good language\" or \"simple language\") is a constructed (made-up) language. Sonja Lang (in past time \"Sonja Elen Kisa\"), a Canadian translator and linguist, made the language. It is based on simple ideas that are known to all cultures. It is not created to be an international auxiliary language (a language for communication between people speaking different languages). It is meant to test ideas about minimalism and pidgins. It is influenced by Taoist ideas. It has only 120 root words, although there is over 50,000 different possible combinations. Toki Pona relies very heavily on expressing ideas by using root words together. For example, \"jan pona\" means \"friend\" in Toki Pona (literally it means: \"good person\").\nNormally Toki Pona uses the Latin alphabet, but many Toki Pona speakers create other systems of writing for this language. There are some attempts to create a writing system based on pictograms, but they have not been very successful.\nExample of text.\nmama pi mi mute o, sina lon sewi kon.\njan o pali e wile sina lon sewi kon en lon ma.\no pana e moku pi tenpo suno ni tawa mi mute.\no weka e pali ike mi. sama la mi weka e pali ike pi jan ante.\no lawa ala e mi tawa ike.\no lawa e mi tan ike.\ntenpo ali la sina jo e ma e wawa e pona.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["language"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Constructed_language","surface_form":"constructed","offset":76},{"uri":"Sonja_Lang","surface_form":"Sonja Lang","offset":108},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":155},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":258},{"uri":"International_auxiliary_language","surface_form":"international auxiliary language","offset":295},{"uri":"Taoism","surface_form":"Taoist","offset":480},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":782},{"uri":"Pictogram","surface_form":"pictograms","offset":937}]}
