{"id":76138,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Hurricane_Centre","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Canadian Hurricane Centre (CHC) is a Canadian agency that is responsible for monitoring and tracking tropical cyclones that come near or affects Canadian territory. The agency warns people about on-coming tropical cyclones and makes hurricane advisories when needed. Its headquarters are in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.\nCHC usually works together with its United States counterpart, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, to coordinate the tracks and positions of all storms that show a possible threat to Canada.\nWhile Atlantic hurricanes are normally uncommon in Canada, they do approach or strike from time to time. Among recent events are Hurricane Bob, which struck New Brunswick, in 1991, Hurricane Luis which struck Newfoundland in September 1995, Hurricane Hortense which struck Nova Scotia in September 1996, Hurricane Michael which struck Newfoundland in October 2000, and Hurricane Juan, which struck Nova Scotia in September 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":54},{"uri":"Agency","surface_form":"agency","offset":63},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclones","surface_form":"tropical cyclones","offset":118},{"uri":"Dartmouth%2C_Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Dartmouth","offset":308},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":319},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":368},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":399},{"uri":"Miami","surface_form":"Miami","offset":428},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":519},{"uri":"1991_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Hurricane Bob","offset":656},{"uri":"New_Brunswick","surface_form":"New Brunswick","offset":684},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":702},{"uri":"1995_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Hurricane Luis","offset":708},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":736},{"uri":"September","surface_form":"September","offset":752},{"uri":"1995","surface_form":"1995","offset":762},{"uri":"1996_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Hurricane Hortense","offset":768},{"uri":"Nova_Scotia","surface_form":"Nova Scotia","offset":800},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":825},{"uri":"2000_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Hurricane Michael","offset":831},{"uri":"October","surface_form":"October","offset":878},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":886},{"uri":"2003_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Hurricane Juan","offset":896},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":950}]}
