{"id":761454,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Lamy","text":"G\u00E9rard Lamy (2 May 1919 \u2013 26 October 2016) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada from 1962 to 1963. During this time, he represented the electoral area of Saint-Maurice\u2014Lafl\u00E8che and was a part of the Social Credit Party. Lamy was born on 2 May 1919 in Shawinigan, Quebec. Before becoming a politician, he was a contractor.\nLamy was only elected one time, in the 1962 federal election. He beat the incumbent Liberal MP, Joseph-Adolphe Richard. Lamy was part of the first group of 26 Social Credit MPs from Quebec who were elected that year. In the election the year after, he lost his election. This was very unexpected, because both Lamy and the Liberal Party thought he would not lose the election. The person that beat him was Liberal Jean Chr\u00E9tien. Chr\u00E9tien would later become the Prime Minister of Canada.\nLamy tried to win two more elections after this. In the 1970 Quebec provincial election, he lost his election as a part of the \"Ralliement cr\u00E9ditiste du Qu\u00E9bec\". In the 1979 general election, he lost his election as a part of the Progressive Conservative Party. Lamy did not run for election ever again after 1979. He died in Trois-Rivi\u00E8res, Quebec, on 26 October 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":49},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":58},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"member of Parliament","offset":79},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_Canada","surface_form":"House of Commons of Canada","offset":112},{"uri":"Representation_(politics)","surface_form":"represented","offset":179},{"uri":"Electoral_district_(Canada)","surface_form":"electoral area","offset":195},{"uri":"Saint-Maurice%E2%80%94Lafl%C3%A8che","surface_form":"Saint-Maurice\u2014Lafl\u00E8che","offset":213},{"uri":"Social_Credit_Party_of_Canada","surface_form":"Social Credit Party","offset":258},{"uri":"Shawinigan","surface_form":"Shawinigan","offset":310},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":322},{"uri":"1962_Canadian_federal_election","surface_form":"1962 federal election","offset":420},{"uri":"Incumbent","surface_form":"incumbent","offset":455},{"uri":"Liberal_Party_of_Canada","surface_form":"Liberal","offset":465},{"uri":"Joseph-Adolphe_Richard","surface_form":"Joseph-Adolphe Richard","offset":477},{"uri":"1963_Canadian_federal_election","surface_form":"election the year after","offset":605},{"uri":"Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien","surface_form":"Jean Chr\u00E9tien","offset":795},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Canada","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Canada","offset":842},{"uri":"1970_Quebec_general_election","surface_form":"1970 Quebec provincial election","offset":924},{"uri":"Ralliement_cr%C3%A9ditiste_du_Qu%C3%A9bec","surface_form":"Ralliement cr\u00E9ditiste du Qu\u00E9bec","offset":996},{"uri":"1979_Canadian_general_election","surface_form":"1979 general election","offset":1037},{"uri":"Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada","surface_form":"Progressive Conservative Party","offset":1098},{"uri":"Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res","surface_form":"Trois-Rivi\u00E8res","offset":1194}]}
