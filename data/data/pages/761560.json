He was known as an urban myth that he was Adolf Hitler's \"pet alligator\". He was born in the state of Mississippi, United States. He survived the Berlin bombing.\nSaturn was brought to the Berlin Zoological Garden. It was here that Hitler reportedly enjoyed visiting the zoo and especially liked the alligator. However, while Hitler may have viewed Saturn at the zoo, he was never Hitler's personal pet.\nDuring World War II, the Berlin Zoo was destroyed, but Saturn was discovered by British soldiers, who then gave the alligator to the Soviets in 1946.\nHe lived at the Moscow Zoo until 22 May 2020, when he died of old age at the age of 83\u201384.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American","surface_form":"American","offset":35},{"uri":"Alligator","surface_form":"alligator","offset":44},{"uri":"Moscow_Zoo","surface_form":"Moscow Zoo","offset":71},{"uri":"Urban_legend","surface_form":"urban myth","offset":102},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":125},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":185},{"uri":"Bombing_of_Berlin_in_World_War_II","surface_form":"Berlin bombing","offset":229},{"uri":"Berlin_Zoological_Garden","surface_form":"Berlin Zoological Garden","offset":271},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":493}]}
