Whedon took over reshoots and other changes that added a brighter tone and more humor, and cut the runtime down to 120 minutes.\nThe theatrical \"Justice League\" was a commercial failure and received mixed reviews, leading Warner Bros. to focus on the future of the DCEU.\nWhen it was revealed that the movie had a troubled production and its state before Snyder stepped down, many fans wanted to see Snyder's version of the movie. Fans and members of the cast and crew petitioned for the release of this, which they nicknamed the \"Snyder Cut\".\nAt the time, Warner Bros. had no plans to release an alternate cut, and movie industry figures regarded the release as unlikely. However, Warner Bros. changed its mind in February 2020. In May, Snyder announced that the original four-hour cut would be completed and released as \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" by the streaming service HBO Max.\nThe Snyder Cut will cost $20\u201330 million to complete the visual effects, score, and editing with an additional $40-50 million for reshoots.\nRelease.\n\"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is scheduled to be released in 2021 on HBO Max.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Superhero","surface_form":"superhero","offset":112},{"uri":"Justice_League_(movie)","surface_form":"Justice League","offset":130},{"uri":"DC_Extended_Universe","surface_form":"DC Extended Universe","offset":207},{"uri":"DC_Comics","surface_form":"DC Comics","offset":252},{"uri":"Justice_League","surface_form":"the same name","offset":280},{"uri":"Zack_Snyder","surface_form":"Zack Snyder","offset":307},{"uri":"Joss_Whedon","surface_form":"Joss Whedon","offset":367},{"uri":"Justice_League","surface_form":"Justice League","offset":480},{"uri":"Batman","surface_form":"Batman","offset":507},{"uri":"Superman","surface_form":"Superman","offset":515},{"uri":"Wonder_Woman","surface_form":"Wonder Woman","offset":525},{"uri":"The_Flash","surface_form":"The Flash","offset":539},{"uri":"Aquaman","surface_form":"Aquaman","offset":550},{"uri":"Cyborg_(comics)","surface_form":"Cyborg","offset":563},{"uri":"Steppenwolf_(comics)","surface_form":"Steppenwolf","offset":619},{"uri":"Post-production","surface_form":"post-production","offset":684},{"uri":"Box-office_bomb","surface_form":"commercial failure","offset":974},{"uri":"HBO_Max","surface_form":"HBO Max","offset":1684}]}
