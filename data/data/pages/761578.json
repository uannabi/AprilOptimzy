This study is needed because numerically obtained solutions could be phantom solutions (fake solutions). This kind of incident is already reported. The popular methods are based on the shooting method or spectral methods. Today, European research teams and Japanese experts are working on this topic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ordinary_differential_equation","surface_form":"ordinary differential equation","offset":129}]}
