He publishes his works in German and French. His literary work bases on his intercultural experiences (e.g. \"Mamb\u00E9's\nHomeland\u00A0(German: Mamb\u00E9s Heimat) and\u00A0Black African Aliens\u00A0(French: Les \u00E9trangers noirs africains), on the other hand he practices social criticism and attacks political grievances (e.g. \"The Destroyed Village\" (German: Das zerst\u00F6rte Dorf) and \"The Hexagon and its accomplices\" (German: Das Hexagon und seine Mitt\u00E4ter)).\nLife.\nAfter graduating from high school in Bangangt\u00E9, he began studying German language and literature and history at the University of Yaound\u00E9 I in 1992 and at the same time completed his teacher training at the Higher Teachers' Training College affiliated with Yaound\u00E9 I.\nMbakop's first trip abroad took place in 1996: At the age of 23 he received a scholarship from the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) to prepare his master's thesis at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt / Main. In 1999 it was published under the title On the Problems of Freedom and Individuality: \"A Study of Goethe's \"G\u00F6tz von Berlichingen\u201D and \u201CEgmont\u201D.\" Four years later Mbakop obtained his doctorate from the same university with a dissertation on the pamphlets of Heinrich Mann and Andr\u00E9 Gide.\nInfluenced by these authors and the values of Christianity - attendance of the Catholic primary school, PhD scholarship from the Catholic Academic Exchange Service (KAAD) \u2013, he has written some literary works that denounce injustice: Mamb\u00E9's Homeland (novel, 2007) scourges the gap between poor and poor Rich in Cameroon, Death of a Disabled (novel, 2010) the lack of understanding of an anonymous society for the needs of the disabled, \"Les \u00E9trangers noirs africains\" (Roman, 2011) the discrimination against Black Africans in Germany. The Social Drama \"The Destroyed Village\" (2010) is a lawsuit against the people of Bali-Nyonga who removed the neighboring village Bawock\nfrom the map in 2007. In the historical drama \"The Hexagon and its Accomplices\" I (2011), France and its Cameroonian henchmen sit on the dock because of the massacre of the Bassas in the second half of the 50s, and in \"The Hexagon and its Accomplices II\" (September 2014) they are accused for the genocide against the Bamil\u00E9k\u00E9s between 1959 and 1971.\nIn 2010 Mbakop published \"The Wood Fire Fairy Tales\" that he had collected three years earlier. In the foreword, he says that he had \"written down these oral stories that were in danger of disappearing, so that they are accessible to everyone,\" and adds, \"At the same time, the written form guarantees that this cultural heritage is saved for posterity.\u201D\nThese fairy tales are a facet of the Med\u00FAmb\u00E0 culture, the richness of which he depicts in his autobiography \"My Childhood and Youth\", that was equally published in 2010. His most recent work is the collection of poems \"The Faces of Life\" (October 2014).\nMbakop's socio-political commitment expressed itself not only in his books, but also in his journalistic writings and numerous interviews with the media.\nWorks.\n\"The Destroyed Village\" (social drama, 2010)\n\"My Childhood and Youth\" (autobiography, 2010\n\"Death of a Disabled\" (novel, 2010)\n\"The Hexagon and its Accomplices\" I (historical drama, 2011)\n\"The Hexagon and its Accomplices II (2014)\"\n\"The Faces of Life\" (poetry, 2014).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cameroon","surface_form":"Cameroon","offset":61}]}
