They are the most common achondrite group with well over 100 distinct finds at present.\nEucrites consist of basaltic rock from the crust of 4 Vesta. They are mostly made up of Ca-poor pyroxene, pigeonite, and Ca-rich plagioclase (anorthite).\nEucrites are named from a Greek word meaning \"easily distinguished\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Achondrite","surface_form":"achondritic","offset":13},{"uri":"Meteorite","surface_form":"meteorite","offset":31},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":81},{"uri":"4_Vesta","surface_form":"4 Vesta","offset":90},{"uri":"HED_meteorite","surface_form":"HED meteorite","offset":127},{"uri":"Basalt","surface_form":"basalt","offset":256},{"uri":"Crust_(geology)","surface_form":"crust","offset":279},{"uri":"4_Vesta","surface_form":"4 Vesta","offset":288},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"Ca","offset":324},{"uri":"Pyroxene","surface_form":"pyroxene","offset":332},{"uri":"Pigeonite","surface_form":"pigeonite","offset":342},{"uri":"Calcium","surface_form":"Ca","offset":357},{"uri":"Plagioclase","surface_form":"plagioclase","offset":365},{"uri":"Anorthite","surface_form":"anorthite","offset":378},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":416}]}
