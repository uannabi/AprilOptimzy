{"id":76164,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)","text":"A shell is a type of projectile used in weapons. It is filled with explosive or other things such as an incendiary device. It is similar to a bomb but is made to be shot out of a gun. Shells are usually large caliber projectiles fired by artillery, armored vehicles (including tanks), and warships. A fuze detonates the explosive or releases whatever else the shell may be carrying.\nAnti-tank guns fire thick shells without much explosive inside. Shells usually have the shape of a cylinder but taper towards the front end to form a point. However, special shells may use other shapes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Projectile","surface_form":"projectile","offset":21},{"uri":"Incendiary_device","surface_form":"incendiary device","offset":104},{"uri":"Bomb","surface_form":"bomb","offset":142},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"gun","offset":179},{"uri":"Caliber","surface_form":"caliber","offset":209},{"uri":"Artillery","surface_form":"artillery","offset":238},{"uri":"Armored_vehicle","surface_form":"armored vehicle","offset":249},{"uri":"Tank","surface_form":"tank","offset":277},{"uri":"Warship","surface_form":"warship","offset":289},{"uri":"Fuze","surface_form":"fuze","offset":301},{"uri":"Anti-tank_gun","surface_form":"Anti-tank gun","offset":383},{"uri":"Cylinder","surface_form":"cylinder","offset":482},{"uri":"Taper","surface_form":"taper","offset":495}]}
