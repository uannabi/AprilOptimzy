{"id":76165,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster","text":"An ion thruster is a kind of spacecraft engine. It works by using static electricity or magnetism to push ions (electrically charged atoms) out the back of the spacecraft. It takes a very long time to speed up, but its fuel lasts much longer than a rocket engine. It has to be carried into outer space by a regular rocket, because the ions don't push hard enough for it to escape the Earth's gravity, but after it gets to outer space it can travel a very long way. An ion thruster needs electricity to run, so the spacecraft has to also carry solar panels or a nuclear reactor.\nIn 2011 the NASA space probe called Dawn used an ion thruster to get to the asteroid Vesta. In 2015 the thruster brought it to the dwarf planet Ceres.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":29},{"uri":"Static_electricity","surface_form":"static electricity","offset":66},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":88},{"uri":"Ions","surface_form":"ions","offset":106},{"uri":"Atoms","surface_form":"atoms","offset":133},{"uri":"Rocket_engine","surface_form":"rocket engine","offset":249},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":290},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":392},{"uri":"Electricity","surface_form":"electricity","offset":487},{"uri":"Solar_panels","surface_form":"solar panels","offset":543},{"uri":"Nuclear_reactor","surface_form":"nuclear reactor","offset":561},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":590},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"space probe","offset":595},{"uri":"Dawn_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Dawn","offset":614},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":654},{"uri":"4_Vesta","surface_form":"Vesta","offset":663},{"uri":"Dwarf_planet","surface_form":"dwarf planet","offset":709},{"uri":"Ceres_(dwarf_planet)","surface_form":"Ceres","offset":722}]}
