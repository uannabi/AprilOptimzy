{"id":761656,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_arithmetic","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Affine arithmetic (AA) is a computer arithmetic which was made to improve the performance of interval arithmetic.\nBackground.\nToday, the interval arithmetic technology which was made by Sunaga and R. Moore is used in many areas including validated numerics. But unfortunately, interval arithmetic is useless when numerical computation is repeated many times. Therefore, many experts have studied how to overcome this weakness. Affine arithmetic is one result of this movement.\nImprovements.\nSome experts are trying to improve affine arithmetic. Their results are known as the extended affine arithmetic or modified affine arithmetic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interval_arithmetic","surface_form":"interval arithmetic","offset":107},{"uri":"Validated_numerics","surface_form":"validated numerics","offset":252}]}
