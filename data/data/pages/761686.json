He has held appointments at Columbia University in New York, Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., University of Pennsylvania, University of California, Berkeley, Yale University, Duke University and Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) in Dakar, Senegal.

He was a research professor in history and politics at Harvard University's W. E. B. Du Bois Research Institute.\nHe has written extensively in African history and politics, including \"La naissance du maquis dans le Sud-Cameroun\" (Paris: Karthala, 1996). \"On the Postcolony\" was published in Paris in 2000 in French and the English translation was published by the University of California Press, Berkeley, in 2001.

He has an A1 rating from the National Research Foundation.\nCurrent appointments.\nMbembe is currently a member of the staff at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research (WISER) at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and also has an annual visiting appointment at the Franklin Humanities Institute at Duke University.\nHe is a contributing editor to the scholarly journal \"Public Culture\".\nWork.\nHis main research topics are African history, Postcolonial Studies and politics and social science.\nMbembe\u2019s most important works are: \"Les jeunes et l\u2019ordre politique en Afrique noire\" (1985); \"La naissance du maquis dans le Sud-Cameroun (1920\u20131960)\"; \"Histoire des usages de la raison en colonie\" (1996); \"De la postcolonie.

He argues that the colonial powers dictated how some people may live and how some must die. He uses the examples of Palestine and South Africa to show how the power of sovereignty now serves the creation of zones of death where death becomes the ultimate exercise of domination and the primary form of resistance.\nPrivate life.\nAchille Mbembe is married to Sarah Nuttall, who is Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies and Director of the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. They have written several texts together and have two children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cameroon","surface_form":"Cameroon","offset":67},{"uri":"Cameroon","surface_form":"Cameroon","offset":178},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":262},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":269},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":314},{"uri":"Brookings_Institution","surface_form":"Brookings Institution","offset":347},{"uri":"University_of_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"University of Pennsylvania","offset":390},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California, Berkeley","offset":418},{"uri":"Yale_University","surface_form":"Yale University","offset":454},{"uri":"Duke_University","surface_form":"Duke University","offset":471},{"uri":"Dakar","surface_form":"Dakar","offset":570},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":577},{"uri":"Harvard_University","surface_form":"Harvard University","offset":1190},{"uri":"Johannesburg","surface_form":"Johannesburg","offset":1843},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1857},{"uri":"Duke_University","surface_form":"Duke University","offset":1955},{"uri":"Social_science","surface_form":"social science","offset":2133},{"uri":"Palestine","surface_form":"Palestine","offset":2900},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":2914}]}
