It was founded on January 7, 2006 and closed on July 31, 2008.\nInstead of the established norm for MMA events, where matchups are strictly one-on-one affairs, each IFL card was a showdown between two teams of five fighters, each fighter fighting one match against another on the opposing team. The IFL was shown in the United States on Fox Sports Net and MyNetworkTV.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":38},{"uri":"Mixed_martial_arts","surface_form":"mixed martial arts","offset":47},{"uri":"Sports_league","surface_form":"league","offset":108},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":435},{"uri":"Fox_Sports_Net","surface_form":"Fox Sports Net","offset":452},{"uri":"MyNetworkTV","surface_form":"MyNetworkTV","offset":471}]}
