When Isaac, Sarah's son, made fun of his younger brother Ishmael, Sarah asked Abraham to ban him, along with his mother. Before sending them away, Abraham gave him bread and a bottle of water and sent them to the desert of Beersheba.\nWhen the water ran out, Hagar placed Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat a little far away, crying. But an angel appeared, traditionally the archangel Michael, who revealed to him a nearby water well, so that both were saved. Two scenes, the exile and the appearance of the angel are common in Italian and Dutch 17th century painting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painted","offset":145},{"uri":"Oil_painting","surface_form":"oil","offset":156},{"uri":"Giambattista_Pittoni","surface_form":"Giambattista Pittoni","offset":163},{"uri":"1720","surface_form":"1720","offset":197},{"uri":"1725","surface_form":"1725","offset":202},{"uri":"Rococo","surface_form":"Rococo","offset":219},{"uri":"Venice","surface_form":"Venice","offset":229},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":237},{"uri":"Santa_Maria_Gloriosa_dei_Frari","surface_form":"Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari","offset":273},{"uri":"Venice","surface_form":"Venice","offset":307}]}
