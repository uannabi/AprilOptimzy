It is over in area.\nIt is in Potos\u00ED in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes at an height of 3,656 metres (11,995\u00A0ft) above sea level.\nThe crust serves as a source of salt and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium. It contains 50% to 70% of the world's known lithium reserves. The large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the surface make the Salar ideal for calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Salt_flat","surface_form":"salt flat","offset":59},{"uri":"Potos%C3%AD_Department","surface_form":"Potos\u00ED","offset":99},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":119},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":150},{"uri":"Brine","surface_form":"brine","offset":272},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":310},{"uri":"Altimeter","surface_form":"altimeter","offset":491}]}
