Originally popularized by Chilean groups Inti-Illimani and Quilapay\u00FAn, it was a song to propagate the \"nueva canci\u00F3n\" movement in Chile at the time, and to support Salvador Allende during the 1970 Chilean presidential elections. The original lyrics were written by Claudio Iturra and the music was composed by Sergio Ortega. To further support the left-wing party and Allende in the 1970 elections, the lyrics were rewritten by V\u00EDctor Jara \u2013 with the mentioning of Allende and the Popular Unity in the lyrics \u2013 so thus a second version came about which then became the anthem for the Popular Unity movement in 1970.\nThis song became popular in the 1970s and has been translated into Portuguese, Italian, Russian, German, and Turkish; however, the authors of the former three remains unknown.\nElectoral campaign lyrics.\nThe lyrics were revised by Victor Jara, and this version has been recorded by Quilapay\u00FAn.\nTurkish version.\nWhen the song \"Venceremos!\" reached its popularity, the lyrics have been translated into Turkish by the Turkish band Grup Yorum (en. 'Commentary Group'), founded in 1984 and are known for the political songwriting.\nGerman version.\nThere have been several versions of the lyrics in German.
