{"id":762309,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2","text":"e=\"preserve\">SpaceX Dragon 2 is a class of reusable spacecraft created by American aerospace manufacturer SpaceX as the replacement to the Dragon 1 cargo spacecraft.\nThe spacecraft launches atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean splashdown. The spacecraft can dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.\nIt has two versions; Crew Dragon, a human-rated capsule capable of carrying up to seven astronauts, and Cargo Dragon, an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft.\nCrew Dragon is equipped with an integrated launch escape system in a set of four side thruster pods with two SuperDraco engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned solar arrays.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reusable_launch_system","surface_form":"reusable","offset":43},{"uri":"SpaceX","surface_form":"SpaceX","offset":106},{"uri":"SpaceX_Dragon","surface_form":"Dragon 1","offset":139},{"uri":"Cargo_spacecraft","surface_form":"cargo spacecraft","offset":148},{"uri":"Falcon_9_Block_5","surface_form":"Falcon 9 Block 5","offset":197},{"uri":"Splashdown","surface_form":"splashdown","offset":255},{"uri":"Human-rating_certification","surface_form":"human-rated","offset":371},{"uri":"Space_capsule","surface_form":"capsule","offset":383},{"uri":"Launch_escape_system","surface_form":"launch escape system","offset":555},{"uri":"SuperDraco","surface_form":"SuperDraco","offset":621},{"uri":"Solar_panels_on_spacecraft","surface_form":"solar arrays","offset":681}]}
