Critics stated that she did not feed Violet enough, but Rachael proved them wrong, stating, \u201CMy number one priority is to ensure that my kids are happy and healthy - so I give them real food, I give them whole pieces of fruit, and I give them vegetables in their lunch box. So Violet will go to school with sushi and a Greek salad, for example...If a mother wants to feed her child cherry tomatoes over cheezels \"(sic)\" then she can. It\u2019s not deprivation or a screwed up childhood... it\u2019s because she cares, and perhaps she has learnt from experience.\u201D\nTelevision.\nRachael works for the Seven Network as a reporter for several of its programs across current affairs and sports telecasts as well as making contestant appearances on Seven Network's in-house celebrity competition programs.
