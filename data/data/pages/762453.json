{"id":762453,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Bless_Fiji","text":"\"Meda Dau Doka\", also known as \"God Bless Fiji\" in English, is the the national anthem of Fiji. It adopted in 1970 when the country got its independence from the United Kingdom.\nEarlier, in 1911, American gospel writer Charles Austin Miles composed the music for the Christian hymn \"Dwelling in Beulah Land\" \u2013 the same melody that is being used for this song today.\nThe lyrics (words) were written by Michael Francis Alexander Prescott. The Fijian version and the English version are not translations of each other, and the English version is used much more commonly.\nIn 2008, it was suggested that this anthem should be sung in Fijian, English and Fiji Hindi \u2013 the country's official languages \u2013 all in one piece.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":51},{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":71},{"uri":"Fiji","surface_form":"Fiji","offset":90},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":140},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":162},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":196},{"uri":"Gospel","surface_form":"gospel","offset":205},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":267},{"uri":"Hymn","surface_form":"hymn","offset":277},{"uri":"Dwelling_in_Beulah_Land","surface_form":"Dwelling in Beulah Land","offset":283},{"uri":"Fijian_language","surface_form":"Fijian","offset":629},{"uri":"Fiji_Hindi","surface_form":"Fiji Hindi","offset":649}]}
