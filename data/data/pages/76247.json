It is used when two objects in the sky are on the opposite side of the sky when viewed from the Earth.\nIn particular, two planets are in opposition to each other when their ecliptic longitudes differ by 180\u00B0. When talking about a single object being in opposition, it is assumed to be opposite from the sun.\nThe Moon is in opposition to the Sun when it is a full moon.\nThe symbol of opposition is \u260D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":43},{"uri":"Astrology","surface_form":"astrology","offset":63},{"uri":"Astronomical_object","surface_form":"objects","offset":95},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":171},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":197},{"uri":"Ecliptic_longitude","surface_form":"ecliptic longitude","offset":248},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":378},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":387},{"uri":"Phases_of_the_Moon","surface_form":"full moon","offset":433}]}
