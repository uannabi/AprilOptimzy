{"id":76256,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre","text":"=\"preserve\">A cubic centimetre (symbol cm\u00B3 or cc) (U.S. spelling: cubic centimeter) is a commonly used unit of volume extending the derived SI-unit cubic metre and corresponds to the volume of a cube measuring 1 cm \u00D7 1 cm \u00D7 1 cm. One cubic centimetre corresponds to a volume of of a cubic metre, or of a litre; therefore, 1\u00A0cm\u00B3 = 1\u00A0mL. In many scientific fields, the use of cubic centimetres has been replaced by the millilitre. The medical and automotive fields are two of the few fields wherein the term cubic centimetre was never discontinued in the United States. In the United Kingdom millilitres are used in preference to cubic centimetres in the medical field.\nOne cubic centimetre of water is equal to 1\u00A0gram.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S.","surface_form":"U.S.","offset":51},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":111},{"uri":"International_System_of_Units","surface_form":"SI","offset":140},{"uri":"Cubic_metre","surface_form":"cubic metre","offset":148},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"litre","offset":304},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"mL","offset":332},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"scientific","offset":344},{"uri":"Millilitre","surface_form":"millilitre","offset":417},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medical","offset":433},{"uri":"Automobile","surface_form":"automotive","offset":445},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":575},{"uri":"Medical","surface_form":"medical","offset":653},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":692},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":712}]}
