Somewhere between 50 and 400 people took to dancing for days.\nThe outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman began to dance randomly in a street in Strasbourg. Some sources claim that, for a short time, the plague killed around fifteen people per day; however, the sources of the city of Strasbourg at the time of the events did not mention the number of deaths, or even if there were any deaths.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dancing","surface_form":"dancing","offset":87},{"uri":"Mania","surface_form":"mania","offset":95},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":113},{"uri":"Alsace","surface_form":"Alsace","offset":125},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":148},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":164}]}
