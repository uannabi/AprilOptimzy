{"id":76267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day","text":"e=\"preserve\">Remembrance Day (in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom) is a day to remember people who fought and died in wars. It is on November 11. On that day in 1918 came the end of World War I with Armistice with Germany.\nRemembrance Day was started in 1919 by King George V of the United Kingdom. On the same day, other countries also have days to remember war and soldiers. There is Veteran's Day in the United States, and Armistice Day in France, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries.\nTraditions.\nThere are some things that people do on Remembrance Day at 11:00 AM. That is when World War I ended. At a ceremony for Remembrance Day, a tune called \"The Last Post\" is played on a bugle (or sometimes a trumpet). Then there are two minutes of silence. At the end of the silence, the bugle plays a tune called \"Reveille\".\nIn many countries, many people wear a poppy on Remembrance Day, and for a few days before. The remembrance poppy is an artificial flower to commemorate those who died in war. People bring wreaths made of poppies to Remembrance Day ceremonies. The poppy is a symbol to show they remember the wars and the soldiers who fought in them. Poppies were chosen as a symbol because they often grew in battlefields after the soldiers stopped fighting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":33},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":44},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":60},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":127},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":191},{"uri":"Armistice_with_Germany_(Compi%C3%A8gne)","surface_form":"Armistice with Germany","offset":208},{"uri":"George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"King George V","offset":271},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":331},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":376},{"uri":"Veteran%27s_Day","surface_form":"Veteran's Day","offset":395},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":416},{"uri":"Armistice_Day","surface_form":"Armistice Day","offset":435},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":452},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":460},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":469},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremony","offset":620},{"uri":"Tune","surface_form":"tune","offset":652},{"uri":"The_Last_Post","surface_form":"The Last Post","offset":665},{"uri":"Bugle","surface_form":"bugle","offset":695},{"uri":"Moment_of_silence","surface_form":"silence","offset":757},{"uri":"Reveille","surface_form":"Reveille","offset":824},{"uri":"Poppy","surface_form":"poppy","offset":873},{"uri":"Wreath","surface_form":"wreath","offset":1023},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":1093},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":1227}]}
