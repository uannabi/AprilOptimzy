{"id":762686,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_reproductive_system","text":"e=\"preserve\">The male reproductive system consists of the penis, scrotum, testicles and a variety of the interior glands like the prostate. All these bodies' parts are very important when it comes to the normal functioning of the body. Each one of them has a different role to play.\nInfertility in Men - Male Reproductive Disorders.\nMost causes of infertility in men is as a result of male reproductive system disorders. An abnormal penis may not be able to deliver the semen properly. In Hypospadias or Epispadias where the opening of the penis is in an abnormal position, male infertility is a possibility.\nOther factors in male infertility are discussed below:.\n1) Varicocele: This is a condition characterized by enlargement, elongation and coiling of the blood vessels around the scrotum. Most times, it appears as bag of warm in the scrotum. It is seen in 10% of normal males and 40% of males with infertility.\n2) Drugs: Impotence in men has been found as side effects of some drugs like Nitrofurantoin, Antihypertensive drug particularly the sympatholytic ones, cimetidine, cancer drugs etc.\n3) Irradiation like X-ray, GSM etc. triggers release of free radicals and can directly halt the Spermatogenesis (process of sperm formation). This is the reason behind covering the scrotum (Testes) during X-ray.\n4) Autoimmune Antibodies: It has been found that some people have antibodies (defense chemicals) against their own sperm cells. By this interaction, the antibodies destroy the sperm cells leading to Azoospermia, oligospermia or normospermia depending on the degree of damage. This condition can be treated if diagnosed.\n5) Liver disease: The liver is a vital organ which ensures that the male hormone (testosterone) dominates in action than female hormone, oestrogen. This it does by breaking down the oestrogen continually. However in a case of liver disease which may impair liver functions, the level of female hormone, oestrogen, increases leading to male characteristics, loss of pubic hair and impotence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":58},{"uri":"Scrotum","surface_form":"scrotum","offset":65},{"uri":"Testicles","surface_form":"testicles","offset":74},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":114},{"uri":"Prostate","surface_form":"prostate","offset":130},{"uri":"Infertility","surface_form":"infertility","offset":348},{"uri":"Reproductive_system_disease","surface_form":"male reproductive system disorders","offset":385},{"uri":"Human_penis_size","surface_form":"abnormal penis","offset":424},{"uri":"Semen","surface_form":"semen","offset":470},{"uri":"Hypospadias","surface_form":"Hypospadias","offset":489},{"uri":"Epispadias","surface_form":"Epispadias","offset":504},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":540},{"uri":"Enlargement","surface_form":"enlargement","offset":717},{"uri":"Elongation","surface_form":"elongation","offset":730},{"uri":"Blood_vessel","surface_form":"blood vessels","offset":760},{"uri":"Scrotum","surface_form":"scrotum","offset":785},{"uri":"Scrotum","surface_form":"scrotum","offset":839},{"uri":"Infertility","surface_form":"infertility","offset":904},{"uri":"Erectile_dysfunction","surface_form":"Impotence","offset":927},{"uri":"Drugs","surface_form":"drugs","offset":983},{"uri":"Nitrofurantoin","surface_form":"Nitrofurantoin","offset":994},{"uri":"Antihypertensive_drug","surface_form":"Antihypertensive drug","offset":1010},{"uri":"Sympatholytic","surface_form":"sympatholytic","offset":1049},{"uri":"Cimetidine","surface_form":"cimetidine","offset":1069},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"cancer drugs","offset":1081},{"uri":"Radical","surface_form":"radicals","offset":1160},{"uri":"Spermatogenesis","surface_form":"Spermatogenesis","offset":1195},{"uri":"Scrotum","surface_form":"scrotum","offset":1280},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"X-ray","offset":1304},{"uri":"Antibody","surface_form":"antibodies","offset":1377},{"uri":"Sperm_cells","surface_form":"sperm cells","offset":1426},{"uri":"Azoospermia","surface_form":"Azoospermia","offset":1510},{"uri":"Oligospermia","surface_form":"oligospermia","offset":1523},{"uri":"Male_infertility","surface_form":"normospermia","offset":1539},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":1653},{"uri":"Organ","surface_form":"organ","offset":1670},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":1704},{"uri":"Testosterone","surface_form":"testosterone","offset":1713},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"female hormone","offset":1752},{"uri":"Oestrogen","surface_form":"oestrogen","offset":1768},{"uri":"Liver_disease","surface_form":"liver disease","offset":1857},{"uri":"Pubic_hair","surface_form":"pubic hair","offset":1996}]}
