It is available in Windows and Linux, macOS. It was developed by S.M. Rump from Hamburg University of Technology. INTLAB was used to develop other MATLAB-based libraries such as VERSOFT and INTSOLVER. It was also used to solve some problems in the Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems.\nFeatures.\nINTLAB can help users to solve the following mathematical/numerical problems with interval arithmetic.\nWorks cited by INTLAB.\nINTLAB is based on the previous studies of the main author, including his works with co-authors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["software"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Interval_arithmetic","surface_form":"interval arithmetic","offset":48},{"uri":"MATLAB","surface_form":"MATLAB","offset":82},{"uri":"Windows","surface_form":"Windows","offset":109},{"uri":"Linux","surface_form":"Linux","offset":121},{"uri":"MacOS","surface_form":"macOS","offset":128}]}
