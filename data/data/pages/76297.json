{"id":76297,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe-Meiningen","text":"The Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen was one of the Ernestine duchies.\nThe dukes were never very important in forming the history of Europe, and unlike their relative in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha never set out to form a long lasting dynasty.\nLike all of the German monarchies the duchy became part of the Weimar Republic after World War I.\nIn the reshuffle of Ernestine territories after the death of the Saxe-Gothaducal line in 1825, Saxe-Meiningen got the territories of Hildburghausen and Saalfeld. The state of Saxe-Meiningen was merged into the new state of Thuringia in 1920.\nThe capital of Saxe-Meiningen was Meiningen; it had an area of 2,468\u00A0km\u00B2 and a population of 269,000 (1905). The summer residence was Altenstein.\nThe present head of Head of the Ducal House of Saxe-Meiningen is Prince Frederick Konrad (born 1952).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ernestine_duchies","surface_form":"Ernestine duchies","offset":43},{"uri":"Weimar_Republic","surface_form":"Weimar Republic","offset":305},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":327},{"uri":"Saxe-Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Gotha","offset":405},{"uri":"Hildburghausen","surface_form":"Hildburghausen","offset":473},{"uri":"Saalfeld","surface_form":"Saalfeld","offset":492},{"uri":"Thuringia","surface_form":"Thuringia","offset":563},{"uri":"Meiningen","surface_form":"Meiningen","offset":616},{"uri":"Altenstein","surface_form":"Altenstein","offset":716},{"uri":"Duke_Frederick_Konrad_of_Saxe-Meiningen","surface_form":"Prince Frederick Konrad","offset":793}]}
