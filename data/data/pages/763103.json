{"id":763103,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_acceleration","text":"e=\"preserve\">In numerical analysis, series acceleration (sometimes called as convergence improvement) is the name for algorithms that transforms slowly convergent series to rapidly convergent series.\nWhere it is used.\nThe NSum and NLimit command in Wolfram Mathematica is based on series acceleration. In addition, Romberg integration (a famous numerical integration method) is also based on this technique.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical analysis","offset":16},{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":118},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":163},{"uri":"Wolfram_Mathematica","surface_form":"Wolfram Mathematica","offset":249},{"uri":"Numerical_integration","surface_form":"numerical integration","offset":345}]}
