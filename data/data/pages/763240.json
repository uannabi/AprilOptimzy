Jeanne-Claude was born in Casablanca, present-day Morocco. They met in Paris in 1958. In 1964, they moved to New York City where they began their joint art career.\nTheir works were given credit to \"Christo\" only, until 1994, when the outdoor works and large indoor were credited to \"Christo and Jeanne-Claude\". They flew in separate planes: in case one crashed, the other could continue their work.\nJeanne-Claude died, aged 74, on November 18, 2009 in New York City, from problems caused by a brain aneurysm.
