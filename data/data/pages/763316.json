{"id":763316,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hick's law, or the Hick\u2013Hyman law is named after British and American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. It describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices.\nIncreasing the number of choices increases the decision time logarithmically. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the Hick\u2013Hyman law is known as the \"rate of gain of information\".\nHick's law may support some computing menu design decisions. For example, to find a given word (e.g. the name of a command) in a randomly ordered word list (e.g. a menu). If the list is alphabetical, and the user knows the name of the command, he or she may be able to use a subdividing strategy that works in logarithmic time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"W._E._Hick","surface_form":"William Edmund Hick","offset":97},{"uri":"Ray_Hyman","surface_form":"Ray Hyman","offset":121},{"uri":"Logarithm","surface_form":"logarithm","offset":293},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"bit","offset":366}]}
