He became a Catholic bishop in his later years.\nby 1659 he questioned the knowledge of the natural world accepted in his time. He questioned the idea that fossils grew in the ground, and the explanations of rock formation. His investigations made him one of the founders of modern stratigraphy and modern geology.\nGeology and stratigraphy.\nSteno's ideas still form the basis of stratigraphy and were key in the development of James Hutton's theory of infinitely repeating cycles of seabed deposition, uplifting, erosion, and submersion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Danish_people","surface_form":"Danish","offset":33},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":40},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":64},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":76},{"uri":"Catholic","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":97},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":106},{"uri":"Stratigraphy","surface_form":"stratigraphy","offset":366},{"uri":"James_Hutton","surface_form":"James Hutton","offset":511},{"uri":"Deposition","surface_form":"deposition","offset":574},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":597}]}
