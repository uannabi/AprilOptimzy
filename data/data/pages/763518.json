{"id":763518,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility","text":"=\"preserve\">Magnetic susceptibility shows whether a material is attracted into or repelled out of a magnetic field. It is a term in electromagnetism.\nIt can be measured. Magnetic susceptibility is a prediction of how magnetised a material will get in a magnetic field. It shows whether a material will be attracted or repelled by a magnet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":100},{"uri":"Electromagnetism","surface_form":"electromagnetism","offset":132},{"uri":"Magnet","surface_form":"magnet","offset":217},{"uri":"Magnetic_field","surface_form":"magnetic field","offset":253}]}
