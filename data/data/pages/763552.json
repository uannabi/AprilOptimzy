{"id":763552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Irhoud","text":"Jebel Irhoud (or Adrar Ighud, Berber: ') is an archaeological site. It is just north of Tlet Ighoud, about south-east of Safi in Morocco.\nThe site is noted for the hominin fossils that have been found there since its discovery in 1960. Originally thought to be Neanderthals, the specimens have since been assigned to \"Homo sapiens\" and have been dated to roughly 300,000 years ago (for the Irhoud 3 mandible, based on other fossils and the flint artefacts found nearby).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Berber_languages","surface_form":"Berber","offset":30},{"uri":"Archaeological_site","surface_form":"archaeological site","offset":47},{"uri":"Ighoud","surface_form":"Tlet Ighoud","offset":88},{"uri":"Safi%2C_Morocco","surface_form":"Safi","offset":121},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":129},{"uri":"Hominin","surface_form":"hominin","offset":164},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":172},{"uri":"Neanderthal","surface_form":"Neanderthal","offset":261},{"uri":"Homo_sapiens","surface_form":"Homo sapiens","offset":318}]}
