{"id":7637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth","text":"Birth (to be born) means when a baby animal comes out of its egg, or out of its mother after pregnancy. It is sometimes thought of as the beginning of life. It is also known as calving in livestock or whelping in meat-eating mammals.\nChanges in pelvis during human pregnancy.\nIn adult females the pelvis is shaped differently from males. The differences are connected with allowing the baby to pass through the birth canal successfully. Also, during pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin softens the ligaments in the pelvis area. This produces a little bit of extra space for the baby's head to get through. The process is hard to describe in words, but fortunately there is an excellent video which explains what goes on.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Baby","surface_form":"baby","offset":32},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":37},{"uri":"Egg_(biology)","surface_form":"egg","offset":61},{"uri":"Mother","surface_form":"mother","offset":80},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":93},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":151},{"uri":"Livestock","surface_form":"livestock","offset":188},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":225},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":297},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormone","offset":463},{"uri":"Relaxin","surface_form":"relaxin","offset":478},{"uri":"Ligament","surface_form":"ligament","offset":498}]}
