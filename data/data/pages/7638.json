{"id":7638,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution","text":"Pollution is when harmful substances are added to the environment and then change it in a bad way. There are five kinds of pollution of the environment: water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, soil pollution and thermal pollution.\nAs pollution grows, ways to combat it have grown. Solar energy and wind energy give people clean ways to power their homes. When people use these alternative forms of energy, they put less carbon dioxide into the environment.\nWater pollution.\nWater pollution is the presence of harmful materials in water, such as sewage, dissolved metal, waste from farms, factories and crude oil spilled from oil tankers. The three main substances that pollute water are nitrates from fertilizers, sewage and detergents.\nActivities such as bathing and washing clothes near lakes, ponds or rivers add nutrients like nitrate and phosphate into the water bodies.This leads to excessive growth of algae on the surface of water. It blocks the penetration of sunlight and air, thus reducing oxygen.\nIt causes harm to organisms living in water and can also harm people's health. In extreme cases, it may cause diseases like cancer.It also leads to loss of a large amount of aquatic life.\nAir pollution.\nAir can be polluted by many things. Examples include poisonous gases, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and very small particulates. Smoke and harmful gases released by fires, industries, and thermal power plants cause air pollution. Using coal and wood as fuels for fire causes a lot of air pollution. Petroleum produces less pollution per ton, but it causes a lot of pollution since a lot of it is burned globally. Air pollution may cause health problems such as asthma or other breathing problems.\nAir pollution causes global warming and acid rain. This makes it difficult for some living things to survive.\nNoise pollution/Sound pollution.\nNoise pollution also known as sound pollution is harmful to the brain and hearing of all animals and humans. This includes the sound of vehicles, loud speakers, airplanes, jets, train horns etc. Noise pollution can cause ear problems or even permanent deafness, especially to older people. The schools which are beside the roads suffer from noise pollution. Students cannot concentrate in their studies. People in hospitals near main roads also suffer.\nThermal pollution.\nThermal pollution is the harmful release of heated liquid into a body of water or heat released into the air as a waste product of a industry.\nA common cause of thermal pollution is using water as a coolant by power stations and industrial manufacturers. This puts back warm water, and so raises the temperature and decreases how much oxygen is in the water. The heat released into the air will make the air warmer which increase global warming.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":140},{"uri":"Water_pollution","surface_form":"water pollution","offset":153},{"uri":"Air_pollution","surface_form":"air pollution","offset":170},{"uri":"Noise","surface_form":"noise","offset":185},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":202},{"uri":"Thermal_pollution","surface_form":"thermal pollution","offset":221},{"uri":"Solar_energy","surface_form":"Solar energy","offset":290},{"uri":"Wind_energy","surface_form":"wind energy","offset":307},{"uri":"Carbon_dioxide","surface_form":"carbon dioxide","offset":429},{"uri":"Water_pollution","surface_form":"Water pollution","offset":483},{"uri":"Sewage","surface_form":"sewage","offset":554},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":572},{"uri":"Farm","surface_form":"farm","offset":590},{"uri":"Factories","surface_form":"factories","offset":597},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"crude oil","offset":611},{"uri":"Oil_spill","surface_form":"spilled","offset":621},{"uri":"Nitrate","surface_form":"nitrate","offset":696},{"uri":"Fertiliser","surface_form":"fertilizer","offset":710},{"uri":"Detergent","surface_form":"detergent","offset":734},{"uri":"Nutrient","surface_form":"nutrient","offset":825},{"uri":"Phosphate","surface_form":"phosphate","offset":852},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":918},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1142},{"uri":"Poison_gas","surface_form":"poisonous gases","offset":1274},{"uri":"Sulphur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulphur dioxide","offset":1291},{"uri":"Nitrogen_dioxide","surface_form":"nitrogen dioxide","offset":1308},{"uri":"Carbon_monoxide","surface_form":"carbon monoxide","offset":1326},{"uri":"Particulates","surface_form":"particulates","offset":1357},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":1407},{"uri":"Thermal_power_station","surface_form":"thermal power plants","offset":1430},{"uri":"Coal","surface_form":"coal","offset":1478},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":1487},{"uri":"Petroleum","surface_form":"Petroleum","offset":1541},{"uri":"Asthma","surface_form":"asthma","offset":1703},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":1760},{"uri":"Acid_rain","surface_form":"acid rain","offset":1779},{"uri":"Power_station","surface_form":"power station","offset":2564},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":2689},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"global warming","offset":2784}]}
