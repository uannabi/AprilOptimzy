{"id":76394,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_mountains","text":"The Tatra Mountains, Tatras or Tatra (Tatry in both Slovak and Polish), constitute a mountain range which forms a natural border between Slovakia and Poland. They occupy an area of 750\u00A0km\u00B2, the major part (600\u00A0km\u00B2) of which lies in Slovakia. The highest Tatra peak, at 2655\u00A0m, is Gerlachovsk\u00FD \u0161t\u00EDt, located in Slovakia. Rysy, at 2499\u00A0m, is the highest Polish peak.\nThe Tatra Mountains are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. Although considerably smaller than the Alps, they are classified as having an alpine landscape. Their high mountain character, combined with great accessibility, makes them popular with tourists and scientists.\nBibliography.\nJ\u00E1n Lacika, \"Tatras\" (2nd edition), Bratislava 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slovak_language","surface_form":"Slovak","offset":52},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":63},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":85},{"uri":"Slovakia","surface_form":"Slovakia","offset":137},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":150},{"uri":"Gerlachovsk%C3%BD_%C5%A1t%C3%ADt","surface_form":"Gerlachovsk\u00FD \u0161t\u00EDt","offset":280},{"uri":"Rysy","surface_form":"Rysy","offset":320},{"uri":"Carpathian_Mountains","surface_form":"Carpathian Mountains","offset":423},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":484}]}
