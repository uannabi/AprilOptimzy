Creation and transfer of coins is based on an open source cryptographic protocol and is not managed by any central authority.\nHistory.\nNew York Coin was released via open-source code published on GitHub on March 6th, 2014 by an unknown developer(s). New York Coin is the only other cryptocurrency in existence, besides Bitcoin, with an unknown anonymous developer still to date. It was a fork of the Litecoin Core client, differing primarily by having a decreased block generation time (30 seconds). NYC Coin has no fees to send and receive funds on network.\nDue to the original developer disappearing at launch in March 2014, early cryptocurrency miners and enthusiasts kept the network alive and healthy during New York Coin's infancy. Charlie Kartchner, an early scrypt miner created the website newyorkco.in in March 2014 to ensure coin data, block explorers, wallets and mining pools were all easily accessible. And also got New York Coin (NYC) added to Coinmarketcap in early 2014.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Peer-to-peer","surface_form":"peer-to-peer","offset":19},{"uri":"Cryptocurrency","surface_form":"cryptocurrency","offset":32},{"uri":"Open-source_software","surface_form":"open-source software","offset":51},{"uri":"MIT_License","surface_form":"X11","offset":99},{"uri":"Cryptographic_protocol","surface_form":"cryptographic protocol","offset":170},{"uri":"GitHub","surface_form":"GitHub","offset":308},{"uri":"Bitcoin","surface_form":"Bitcoin","offset":431}]}
