Ancient Chinese records tell of local villagers selling mythical dragon bones to make medicine. These were probably the fossils of Tuojiangosaurus.\nTuojiangosaurus wasn't a dragon. It was a dinosaur. To protect it, it had 17 pairs of spiky plates down its back and tail. A frightening set of tail spikes completed this plant-eater's armour.\nWith one deadly swing of its spiked tail Tuojiangosaurus could hurt the belly of an attacking predator.\nThe Chinese province where Tuojiangosaurus was found is home to the Zigong Dinosaur Park, the first dinosaur museum in Asia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":31},{"uri":"Upper_Jurassic","surface_form":"upper Jurassic","offset":62},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":102},{"uri":"Szechuan","surface_form":"Szechuan","offset":147},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":157},{"uri":"Dragon","surface_form":"dragon","offset":229}]}
