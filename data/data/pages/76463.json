{"id":76463,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a degree is a common way to measure plane angle. It is written with the symbol formula_1, where formula_1 corresponds to the entire circle.\nIt is not an SI unit. The SI uses radian to measure plane angle. However, according to the SI brochure, it is an accepted unit by SI.\nHistory.\nThe actual reason of choosing the degree as a way to measure plane angle is unknown. One theory says that it is related with the fact that a year is approximately 360 days. Some ancient calendar<nowiki/>s, for example the Persian calendar and the Babylonian calendar, used 360 days for a year.\nAnother theory says that the Babylonians divided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle. The angle was then divided into 60 parts. This is because they used sexagesimal or base-60 numeral system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":65},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":71},{"uri":"SI_unit","surface_form":"SI unit","offset":182},{"uri":"Radian","surface_form":"radian","offset":203},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":221},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":227},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":373},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":379},{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":498},{"uri":"Persian_calendar","surface_form":"Persian calendar","offset":534},{"uri":"Equilateral_triangle","surface_form":"equilateral triangle","offset":688},{"uri":"Numeral_system","surface_form":"numeral system","offset":801}]}
