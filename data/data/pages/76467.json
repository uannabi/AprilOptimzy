{"id":76467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)","text":"=\"preserve\">In astronomy, an epoch (or sometimes epochal moment) is a moment in time for which the position or the orbital elements of a celestial body are specified.\nThe position at other times can be measured by taking into account proper motion or orbital motion. In the case of orbital elements for a solar system body, these change due to perturbation by other bodies in our solar system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":15},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":80},{"uri":"Orbital_element","surface_form":"orbital element","offset":115},{"uri":"Proper_motion","surface_form":"proper motion","offset":234},{"uri":"Orbital_motion","surface_form":"orbital motion","offset":251},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":305}]}
