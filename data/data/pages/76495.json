{"id":76495,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Demessieux","text":"Jeanne Demessieux (born Montpellier, France, 13 February 1921; died Paris, 11 November 1968), was a French organist and composer.\nShe started to learn the piano when she was very young, before taking up the organ. Her family moved to Paris so that she could continue to have music lessons there. She became an organ student at the Conservatoire in 1933. In the same year she got a job as organist of the St. Esprit church in Paris. She had this job for 29 years.\nBetween 1936 and 1939, she studied organ privately with the great Marcel Dupr\u00E9, and in 1939 she joined his organ class at the Conservatoire. After receiving a first prize in organ performance and improvisation in 1941, she studied five more years with Dupr\u00E9 in Meudon, before she played her first recital at Salle Pleyel in Paris in 1946. This was the beginning of her career as an international recitalist. She played more than 700 concerts in Europe and the United States.\nGifted with an amazing musical memory, she could play more than 2,500 pieces from memory, including all the organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach, C\u00E9sar Franck, Franz Liszt, Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy and Dupr\u00E9.\nShe was also a remarkable improviser. When she gave her first solo concert in Paris at Salle Pleyel in 1946, she was given four musical themes and improvised a symphony in four movements.\nA teacher of the organ at Nancy and Brussels, she made several LP recordings, of which those of music by Franck are probably the best known. She had plans to record all the organ works of Olivier Messiaen. However, she died relatively young, at age 47, of cancer, before she was able to finish this task.\nShe wrote many compositions, especially for the organ. These include: \"Nativit\u00E9\", \"Six \u00C9tudes\", \"Sept M\u00E9ditations sur le Saint-Esprit\", \"Triptyque\", \"Twelve Choral-Preludes on Gregorian Chant Themes\", \"Te Deum\", \"R\u00E9pons pour les Temps Liturgiques\", and \"Pr\u00E9lude et fugue en UT\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Montpellier","surface_form":"Montpellier","offset":24},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":37},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":68},{"uri":"Pipe_organ","surface_form":"organist","offset":107},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":120},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":155},{"uri":"Marcel_Dupr%C3%A9","surface_form":"Marcel Dupr\u00E9","offset":529},{"uri":"Improvisation","surface_form":"improvisation","offset":659},{"uri":"Recital","surface_form":"recital","offset":760},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":908},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":923},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":1061},{"uri":"C%C3%A9sar_Franck","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar Franck","offset":1084},{"uri":"Franz_Liszt","surface_form":"Franz Liszt","offset":1098},{"uri":"Felix_Mendelssohn-Bartholdy","surface_form":"Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy","offset":1111},{"uri":"Nancy","surface_form":"Nancy","offset":1364},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":1374},{"uri":"Olivier_Messiaen","surface_form":"Olivier Messiaen","offset":1526},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":1594}]}
