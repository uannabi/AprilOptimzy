{"id":765337,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockhole_frog","text":"The rockhole frog, Australian cross-banded tree frog or skipping frog (\"Litoria meiriana\") is a small frog from Australia. It lives in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.\nMale adult frogs are about 2 cm long and females are 2.2 cm long. They have webbed hind feet but their front feet are not webbed. Some are dark brown with dark green spots and some are less clear. Some have spots on their thighs. Some have white spots near their eyes.\nThey live near permanent bodies of water and do not like puddles or vernal pools that dry up. They live in holes in rocks and sometimes in caves or near waterfalls. They are so light that they can skip on the surface of the water like a skipping stone.\nThey lay eggs in pools near the bottoms of tall rocks, 30\u201340 eggs at a time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":102},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":112}]}
