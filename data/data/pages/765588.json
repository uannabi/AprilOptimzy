{"id":765588,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wienerschnitzel","text":"Wienerschnitzel is an American fast food chain founded in 1961 (as \"Der Wienerschnitzel\") that specializes in hot dogs, also known as the World's Largest Hot Dog Chain. Wienerschnitzel locations are found predominantly in California and Texas, though others are located in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Washington. Outside the 50 states, there is a store located in Guam and one in Panama.\nThe chain is recognizable by the A-frame style roofs of its older restaurants, similar to the original structures used by IHOP, Tastee-Freez, Nickerson Farms, and Whataburger. Structures that have been converted from Wienerschnitzels into other restaurants often retain the distinctive architecture. The chain's advertising mascot is an anthropomorphized chili dog known as The Delicious One, who runs from people who want to eat him.\nWienerschnitzel sponsors the tongue-in-cheek Wiener Nationals, the \"de facto\" national dachshund racing championship series for the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":22},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":31},{"uri":"Hot_dog","surface_form":"hot dog","offset":110},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":222},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":237},{"uri":"Arizona","surface_form":"Arizona","offset":273},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":282},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":292},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":302},{"uri":"New_Mexico","surface_form":"New Mexico","offset":313},{"uri":"Nevada","surface_form":"Nevada","offset":325},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":333},{"uri":"Washington_(state)","surface_form":"Washington","offset":343},{"uri":"Guam","surface_form":"Guam","offset":406},{"uri":"Panama","surface_form":"Panama","offset":422},{"uri":"IHOP","surface_form":"IHOP","offset":552},{"uri":"Tastee-Freez","surface_form":"Tastee-Freez","offset":558},{"uri":"Nickerson_Farms","surface_form":"Nickerson Farms","offset":572},{"uri":"Whataburger","surface_form":"Whataburger","offset":593},{"uri":"Mascot","surface_form":"mascot","offset":754},{"uri":"Anthropomorphism","surface_form":"anthropomorphized","offset":767},{"uri":"Chili_dog","surface_form":"chili dog","offset":785},{"uri":"The_Delicious_One","surface_form":"The Delicious One","offset":804},{"uri":"Wiener_Nationals","surface_form":"Wiener Nationals","offset":910},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":933},{"uri":"Dachshund_racing","surface_form":"dachshund racing","offset":952}]}
