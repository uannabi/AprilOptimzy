{"id":765625,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kawasaki disease is a syndrome of unknown cause that results in a fever and mainly affects children under 5 years of age. It is a form of vasculitis, where blood vessels become inflamed throughout the body.\nThe fever typically lasts for more than five days. While the cause is unknown, it may be due to an infection triggering an autoimmune response.\nBoys are more commonly affected than girls. The disorder was first described in 1967 by Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Syndrome","surface_form":"syndrome","offset":35},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":79},{"uri":"Vasculitis","surface_form":"vasculitis","offset":151},{"uri":"Infection","surface_form":"infection","offset":319},{"uri":"Autoimmune_disease","surface_form":"autoimmune response","offset":343},{"uri":"Tomisaku_Kawasaki","surface_form":"Tomisaku Kawasaki","offset":452}]}
