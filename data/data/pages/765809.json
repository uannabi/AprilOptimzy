Products and services are often marketed as gifts or memorials.\nHistory.\nThe organization was founded in 2014 by Rhys King and is based in Wales, UK. It allows individuals to dedicate and \"assign\" a name to stars within the known constellations. Upon locating the desired star and assigning the chosen name, SNR records the coordinates and places them into a secure anthology to be published in the United Kingdom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gift","surface_form":"gift","offset":148},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":157},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":243},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":311},{"uri":"Constellations","surface_form":"constellations","offset":334},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":503}]}
