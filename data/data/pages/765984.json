{"id":765984,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Bernal_(diplomat)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Laura Bernal (1956 \u2013 26 April 2020) was an Argentine diplomat. She served as Argentina's ambassador to Ireland from 2016 until her sudden death in 2020. She was present in the country for her compatriot Pope Francis's visit to Ireland as part of World Meeting of Families 2018.\nBernal was from Buenos Aires. She died at her Rathmines home on 26 April 2020 and was found post-mortem to have contracted COVID-19. At the request of her sister and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bernal's body was not repatriated. Her funeral took place on 15 May at St Michael's parish church in Foxford and she was buried afterwards at nearby Craggagh Cemetery. Foxford is where Admiral William Brown (who founded the Argentine Navy) was born, hence this choice. As well as her sister, Bernal was survived by niblings and a sister-in-law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pope_Francis","surface_form":"Pope Francis","offset":216},{"uri":"Pope_Francis%27s_visit_to_Ireland","surface_form":"visit to Ireland","offset":231},{"uri":"World_Meeting_of_Families_2018","surface_form":"World Meeting of Families 2018","offset":259},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":307},{"uri":"Rathmines","surface_form":"Rathmines","offset":337},{"uri":"Coronavirus_disease_2019","surface_form":"COVID-19","offset":414},{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"COVID-19 pandemic","offset":468},{"uri":"Foxford","surface_form":"Foxford","offset":588},{"uri":"William_Brown_(admiral)","surface_form":"Admiral William Brown","offset":672},{"uri":"Argentine_Navy","surface_form":"Argentine Navy","offset":711}]}
