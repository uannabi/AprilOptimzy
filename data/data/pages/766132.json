In the early 1960s before the Cultural Revolution, he became a critic of Mao.\nLiu disappeared from public life in 1968 and was called the \"commander of China's bourgeoisie headquarters\", China's foremost \"capitalist-roader\", and a traitor to the revolution.\nLiu died on 12 November 1969 in Kaifeng, Henan while under torture, aged 70. After his death, the Chinese government later honored him with a state funeral and is now seen as a political hero.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chairman_of_the_NPC_Standing_Committee","surface_form":"Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee","offset":111},{"uri":"Vice_Chairman_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China","surface_form":"First Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China","offset":169},{"uri":"President_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Chairman (President) of the People's Republic of China","offset":243},{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":317},{"uri":"Mao_Zedong","surface_form":"Mao Zedong","offset":442},{"uri":"Zhou_Enlai","surface_form":"Zhou Enlai","offset":465},{"uri":"Cultural_Revolution","surface_form":"Cultural Revolution","offset":507},{"uri":"Capitalist_roader","surface_form":"capitalist-roader","offset":682},{"uri":"Kaifeng","surface_form":"Kaifeng","offset":767},{"uri":"Henan","surface_form":"Henan","offset":776},{"uri":"Torture","surface_form":"torture","offset":794},{"uri":"State_funeral","surface_form":"state funeral","offset":877}]}
