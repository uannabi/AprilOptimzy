{"id":766342,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upasarga","text":"Upasarga is a term used in Sanskrit grammar for a special class of twenty prepositional particles prefixed to verbs or to action nouns. In Vedic, these prepositions are separable from verbs; in classical Sanskrit the prefixing is obligatory.\nBy the usual rules of euphonic combination the two prepositions ending in visarga, ' and ', have the alternative forms \"nis\"-/\"nir\"- and \"dus\"-/\"dur\"- respectively. The listing has these variants, not the forms in pausa, and thus has twenty-two items in all.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vyakarana","surface_form":"Sanskrit grammar","offset":27},{"uri":"Vedic","surface_form":"Vedic","offset":139},{"uri":"Sandhi","surface_form":"euphonic combination","offset":264},{"uri":"Visarga","surface_form":"visarga","offset":316},{"uri":"Pausa","surface_form":"pausa","offset":456}]}
