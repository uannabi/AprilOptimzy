{"id":76645,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Jefferson","text":"Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson, born Martha Wayles (October 30, 1748 \u2013 September 6, 1782) was the only wife of her second husband, Thomas Jefferson.\nShe was a widow at her second wedding, as her first husband had died young. When her second husband, Jefferson, was Governor of Virginia, she served as First Lady of Virginia from 1779 to 1781.\nThe Jeffersons had six children together, but only two daughters survived to adulthood, and only one past the age of 25. Weakened by childbirth, Martha Jefferson died several months after the birth of her last child, twenty years before her husband became the third President of the United States. At her wishes, he never married again.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":132},{"uri":"Governor_of_Virginia","surface_form":"Governor of Virginia","offset":266},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":610}]}
