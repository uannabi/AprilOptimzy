It gives information and opinions about current events and news. Usually people like to read them to stay informed about their local city, state or country. Newspapers can be delivered to one's home, by subscription. One also can buy a newspaper at a store or at a newsstand. Recycling of paper is common. It may be converted to new paper, for example.\nNewspapers usually have many topics. They usually include political events, crime, business, sports, and weather news. Newspapers use photographs to illustrate stories; and also often include comic<nowiki/>s and other entertainment, such as crosswords and horoscopes. Many have opinion sections. These sections print the opinions of people who work for the newspaper. The opinions, which are usually on stories in the news, are called \"editorials\". Opinion sections usually also print short letters from people who read the newspaper.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Publication","surface_form":"publication","offset":17},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":40},{"uri":"Event","surface_form":"event","offset":151},{"uri":"News","surface_form":"news","offset":162},{"uri":"Subscription","surface_form":"subscription","offset":306},{"uri":"Recycling","surface_form":"Recycling","offset":379},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":436},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"political","offset":514},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":532},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":539},{"uri":"Sports","surface_form":"sports","offset":549},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":561},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":590},{"uri":"Comic_strip","surface_form":"comic","offset":648},{"uri":"Crossword","surface_form":"crossword","offset":697},{"uri":"Horoscope","surface_form":"horoscope","offset":712}]}
