{"id":766649,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_alphabet","text":"The Finnish alphabet has 29 letters. They are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, \u00C5, \u00C4, and \u00D6. The letters \u0160 and \u017D, although often overlooked, occur in Finnish only in loanwords and are very rare.\nThe letters B, C, F, and G only occur in relatively new loanwords. However, the letter G still occurs in native Finnish words in the digraph NG. The letters Q, \u0160, W, X, Z, \u017D, and \u00C5 are virtually absent in Finnish and are pretty much not used at all.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
