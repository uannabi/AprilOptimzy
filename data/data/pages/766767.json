{"id":766767,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_rockhole_frog","text":"The Kimberly rockhole frog (\"Litoria aurifera\") is a small frog from northern Australia. It lives in the Kimberly area. It was first found in the Prince Regent River by two plant scientists.\nAdult frogs are about 2.2 cm long. They live in rockholes and streams with rocky bottoms. They are so small and light that they can skip across the top of the water like a skipping stone.\nThey lay 60-110 eggs at a time, in different places instead of large groups of eggs like other frogs. The tadpoles have dark black bodies and tails with bright gold spots. They eat algae and their mouths have suckers so they can hold onto rocks in fast streams. They are about 1 cm long when they become frogs.\nThe Latin name \"aurifera\" means \"carrying gold.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":59},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":78},{"uri":"Prince_Regent_River","surface_form":"Prince Regent River","offset":146},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"plant scientists","offset":173}]}
