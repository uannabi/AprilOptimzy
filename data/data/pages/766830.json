{"id":766830,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar%C3%BAa","text":"e=\"preserve\">Gar\u00FAa is a Spanish word meaning \"drizzle\" or \"mist\". Most often, gar\u00FAa is used to refer to the moist cold fog that occurs on the coasts of Peru, southern Ecuador, and northern Chile, during the winter months. Gar\u00FAa is called Camanchaca in Chile.\nThese coastal regions in Peru, Ecuador and Chile have a desert climate. There's almost no rain during the year. Gar\u00FAa brings mild temperatures and high humidity. It also provides moisture from fog and mist to a nearly-rainless region. The places where there's often fog also have more vegetation. They are called fog oases, or lomas.\nFog and drizzle are common on the coast, and near lakes. In the case of gar\u00F9a, its impact on the climate is unique.\nHow it forms.\nThe Humboldt Current runs along the coast. It brings cold waters. It is responsible for both the desert-like climate and the gar\u00F9a. The area covers the coasts of Peru and Chile from latitudes 5\u00B0 to 30\u00B0 South, a north-south distance of roughly. The Humboldt Current brings mild temperatures and high humidity to a very arid region. The cold waters create an inversion: the air near the ocean surface is cooler than the air above, contrary to most climatic situations. The trade winds blow the cool air and fog eastward over coastal areas, where the fog transforms into drizzle and mist, the gar\u00FAa.\nGar\u00FAa is a dense fog that does not produce rain. The water droplets in the fog measure between 1 and 40 microns across, too fine to form rain.\nImpact on climate.\nThe impact of the Humboldt Current and the gar\u00FAa it produces is substantial. Lima, Peru is near sea level. The city is located at 12\u00B0 south latitude. It is in the tropics and would in most climatic situations have average temperatures of or higher in every month of the year. By contrast, Lima has monthly average temperatures that range from (January through March) in the warmest months and in the coolest months of July through September, the months in which the gar\u00FAa is most frequent.\nThe impact on sunshine is even more important. Only 34 percent of daylight hours in Lima have sunshine every year. On average, July and August receive less than one hour a day of sunshine. Lima receives only 1,230 hours of sunshine per year. By contrast, London, notoriously cloudy and foggy, gets 1,573 hours of sunshine annually and New York City receives 2,535 hours of sunshine annually. The climate of Lima is typical of the coasts of Peru and northern Chile.\nNineteenth-century American author, Herman Melville called Lima \u201Cthe strangest, saddest city thou cans\u2019t see.\", because of the gar\u00F9a clouds and mist in winter. Twenty-first century Lima, on the oher hand, has a flourishing tourist trade and has been described as having a \"hidden loveliness.\"\nThe desert coast on the 1700 mile north south stretch is very dry: On average, it gets less than of precipitation per year. Some areas may go without rain for many years. Only the moisture condensed from the gar\u00F9a clouds -- plus occasional El Ni\u00F1o events -- enables islands of vegetation to be present in the lomas dotted up and down the Peruvian and Chilean coasts. Except for the lomas and river valleys draining the higher and more humid Andes the coastal desert has almost no vegetation.\nThe gar\u00FAa extends only a few kilometers inland. It dissipates over land especially where it coalesces against mountain slopes at elevations of to, the altitudes at which the vegetated lomas are found.\nFog collection.\nIn the area, water is scarce, and scientis have found a way to collect water from from the moisture-laden gar\u00FAa.\nIn Chile, in 1985, scientists devised a fog collection system: They used nets to capture the water droplets in the fog. These nets are made of a special material, polyolefin. That way, it is possible to produce running water for villages in these otherwise desert areas. The Camanchacas Project installed 50 large fog-collecting nets on a mountain ridge, which captured some 2% of the water in the fog.\nIn 2005, another installation of panels of produced per square meter per day.\nIn Peru there is an effort to preserve the fragile ecosystem of the gar\u00FAa-watered lomas. Conservation groups have installed fog-catching nets in the Atiquipa District to capture water and help the 80 families who live within the area to expand agriculture, primarily of olives.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":24},{"uri":"Fog","surface_form":"fog","offset":119},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":152},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":167},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":189},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":207},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":315},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":322},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":349},{"uri":"Temperatures","surface_form":"temperatures","offset":389},{"uri":"Humidity","surface_form":"humidity","offset":411},{"uri":"Moisture","surface_form":"moisture","offset":438},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":544},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":690},{"uri":"Humboldt_Current","surface_form":"Humboldt Current","offset":727},{"uri":"Arid","surface_form":"arid","offset":1041},{"uri":"Inversion_temperature","surface_form":"inversion","offset":1080},{"uri":"Trade_wind","surface_form":"trade winds","offset":1194},{"uri":"Fog","surface_form":"fog","offset":1337},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":1363},{"uri":"Micrometre","surface_form":"microns","offset":1424},{"uri":"Lima","surface_form":"Lima, Peru","offset":1559},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":2227},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":2307},{"uri":"Herman_Melville","surface_form":"Herman Melville","offset":2473},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"precipitation","offset":2830},{"uri":"Condensation","surface_form":"condensed","offset":2919},{"uri":"Andes","surface_form":"Andes","offset":3171},{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"villages","offset":3781},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":3809},{"uri":"Ecosystem","surface_form":"ecosystem","offset":4084},{"uri":"Olive_tree","surface_form":"olives","offset":4303}]}
