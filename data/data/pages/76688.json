{"id":76688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Windsor","text":"e=\"preserve\">The House of Windsor is the current Royal House of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and each of the other Commonwealth realms. The older part is a branch of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line of the House of Wettin, while the newer part is a branch of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00FCcksburg line of the House of Oldenburg.\nDescendants of Victoria.\nQueen Victoria married Prince Albert, son of Duke Ernst I of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Therefore her descendants are members of the ducal family of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha with the house name of Wettin. Victoria's son Edward VII and his son George V reigned as members of this house. But during World War I there was a lot of hatred of anything German. A lot of this feeling was stirred up by newspapers. People with German names were beaten up, and shops with German names had their windows broken. Even the Royal Family were accused of supporting Germany. On 17 July 1917 George V ordered the Royal Family to give up their German titles, and change German-sounding titles and house names for English-sounding versions. Prince Louis Battenberg became Lord Louis Mountbatten. The Duke of Teck became the Marquis of Milford Haven and the name of the royal house, and the royal surname was changed to Windsor, after the town of Windsor and Windsor Castle.\nWhen he heard about the change of name, German Emperor William II joked that he wanted to see Shakespeare's play \"The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\".\nDescendants of Elizabeth II.\nIn April 1952, Queen Elizabeth II said that her descendants will keep name and House of Windsor, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00FCcksburg through their father, born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a line of the House of Oldenburg.\nOn 8 February 1960, the Queen decided instead to keep the House and Family of Windsor but that their personal surname is \"Mountbatten-Windsor\". Mountbatten is the surname adopted by Prince Philip before his marriage, an anglicization of his mother's family name of Battenberg.\nList of Monarchs in the House of Windsor.\nThe next in line for the throne is Prince Charles; if so he may be known as King Charles III.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_House","surface_form":"Royal House","offset":49},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","offset":68},{"uri":"Commonwealth_realm","surface_form":"Commonwealth realm","offset":143},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha","offset":198},{"uri":"House_of_Wettin","surface_form":"House of Wettin","offset":232},{"uri":"Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg","surface_form":"Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00FCcksburg","offset":289},{"uri":"House_of_Oldenburg","surface_form":"House of Oldenburg","offset":342},{"uri":"Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":393},{"uri":"Albert_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Prince Albert","offset":410},{"uri":"Ernst_I%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Duke Ernst I","offset":432},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha","offset":448},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha","offset":532},{"uri":"House_of_Wettin","surface_form":"Wettin","offset":577},{"uri":"Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Edward VII","offset":600},{"uri":"George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"George V","offset":623},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":677},{"uri":"Windsor%2C_Berkshire","surface_form":"town of Windsor","offset":1300},{"uri":"Windsor_Castle","surface_form":"Windsor Castle","offset":1320},{"uri":"German_Emperor","surface_form":"German Emperor","offset":1376},{"uri":"William_II%2C_German_Emperor","surface_form":"William II","offset":1391},{"uri":"Shakespeare","surface_form":"Shakespeare","offset":1430},{"uri":"The_Merry_Wives_of_Windsor","surface_form":"The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha","offset":1450},{"uri":"Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Queen Elizabeth II","offset":1533},{"uri":"House_of_Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg","surface_form":"House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00FCcksburg","offset":1619},{"uri":"Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh","surface_form":"Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark","offset":1696},{"uri":"House_of_Oldenburg","surface_form":"House of Oldenburg","offset":1747},{"uri":"Mountbatten-Windsor","surface_form":"Mountbatten-Windsor","offset":1889},{"uri":"Battenberg_family","surface_form":"Battenberg","offset":2032}]}
