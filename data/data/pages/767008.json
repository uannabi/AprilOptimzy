{"id":767008,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booroolong_frog","text":"The booroolong frog (\"Litoria booroolongensis\") is a tree frog from Australia. It lives in New South Wales and Victoria.\nAdult frogs are about 5 cm long. They can be brown or gray or green, with black marks. Their bellies are white.\nThey live in or near streams 200 to 1000 meters above sea level. They lay eggs in cracks in underwater rocks. The tadpoles grow in pools or slow-flowing streams.\nAs of the early 2000s, the booroolong frog was endangered because human beings divided their habitat into small pieces for logging and grazing, because willow trees clogged the streams where they live, and because invasive species of fish ate the tadpoles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":53},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":68},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":488},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive species","offset":609}]}
