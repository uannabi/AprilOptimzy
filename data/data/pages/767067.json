{"id":767067,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M42_motorway","text":"The M42 is a motorway in the Midlands of England. It runs northeast from the M5 near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire to near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. It runs south of the West Midlands conurbation, going through Solihull and Birmingham Airport. Here, it crosses the M6 motorway. It then goes past Coleshill and then past Tamworth, before ending. At the end of the motorway, just south of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, it becomes the A42.\nThe road was first built in the 1970s, and was built to make a motorway between the East and West Midlands. It is now also used as part of a ring road around Birmingham nicknamed the \"Birmingham Box\". It is made up of parts of the M5, M6, and M42 motorways.\nJunctions.\nCoventry (S & W), N.E.C.
