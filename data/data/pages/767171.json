{"id":767171,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M6_Toll","text":"The M6 Toll, also called the Birmingham North Relief Road (BNRR) or Midland Expressway, is a toll motorway in the Midlands. It is used as a way to avoid the traffic on the M6 motorway by Birmingham. It goes from the M6 at Coleshill to the M6 at Wolverhampton. It is a toll road, so drivers have to pay to use it.\nIt first opened in 2003, and many people do not think it has been a good idea. It was built to lower the amount of traffic on the M6 between Coleshill and Wolverhampton, which is the busiest part. Many people have noted that the traffic has not gone down since it opened. Many people say it is because the road is too expensive to use and many drivers do not want to pay the fee.\nJunctions.\nThe southernmost section of the M6 Toll, south of Junction T1, is shared by traffic using the M42. Vehicles using only this five-mile section do not have to pay a toll.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Toll_road","surface_form":"toll","offset":93},{"uri":"Controlled-access_highway","surface_form":"motorway","offset":98},{"uri":"Midlands","surface_form":"Midlands","offset":114},{"uri":"M6_motorway","surface_form":"M6 motorway","offset":172},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":187},{"uri":"Coleshill%2C_Warwickshire","surface_form":"Coleshill","offset":222},{"uri":"Wolverhampton","surface_form":"Wolverhampton","offset":245},{"uri":"Toll_road","surface_form":"toll road","offset":268}]}
