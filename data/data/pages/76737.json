It is based in New York City. The AP is a non-profit cooperative owned by the newspapers, radio and Television stations who share its news stories. Most articles are written by staff members belonging to the Newspaper Guild Union, a part of the AFL-CIO. Many news organizations that are not members pay a fee to use the stories. The AP has more than 250 local news offices in more than 100 countries.\nIn 2013 the United States Department of Justice announced it had secretly obtained records of telephone calls by AP a few months before the United States presidential election, 2012. Associated Press CEO Gary Pruitt called the DOJ action: a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' of Freedom of the Press rights, according to Fox News. Eric Holder, the United States Attorney General, claimed that he was not involved.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":73},{"uri":"Non-profit_organization","surface_form":"non-profit","offset":82},{"uri":"News","surface_form":"news media","offset":93},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":128},{"uri":"Cooperative","surface_form":"cooperative","offset":166},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":191},{"uri":"Radio_station","surface_form":"radio","offset":203},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"Television","offset":213},{"uri":"AFL-CIO","surface_form":"AFL-CIO","offset":358},{"uri":"2013","surface_form":"2013","offset":517},{"uri":"United_States_Department_of_Justice","surface_form":"United States Department of Justice","offset":526},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2012","surface_form":"United States presidential election, 2012","offset":654},{"uri":"CEO","surface_form":"CEO","offset":714},{"uri":"Freedom_of_the_Press","surface_form":"Freedom of the Press","offset":796},{"uri":"Fox_News","surface_form":"Fox News","offset":838},{"uri":"Eric_Holder","surface_form":"Eric Holder","offset":848},{"uri":"United_States_Attorney_General","surface_form":"United States Attorney General","offset":865}]}
