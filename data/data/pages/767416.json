They live in high grasslands and forests near ponds and dams.\nAdult frogs are 6 cm long, green with brown marks.\nThey lay eggs in groups on underwater plants in still water or water that only moves slowly. The eggs take 6 days to hatch.\nIn 2018 and 2019, scientists from the Australian Museum asked people in Tasmania to go outside and record frog calls on their phones using FrogID in a citizen science project.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":73},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":83},{"uri":"Citizen_science","surface_form":"citizen science","offset":481}]}
