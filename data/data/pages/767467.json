{"id":767467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A38(M)_motorway","text":"The A38(M), usually called the Aston Expressway, is a short motorway in Birmingham, England. It is about long. It runs from the M6 at Gravelly Hill Interchange into Central Birmingham. It first opened in 1972, and is part of the long A38 road.\nThe motorway is strange as it has seven lanes with no barrier in the middle. Electronic signs above the motorway tell drivers which lanes they can use with either a green tick or red cross. Motorcycles are banned from the middle lane because drains on the ground can make them crash.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Controlled-access_highway","surface_form":"motorway","offset":60},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":72},{"uri":"M6_motorway","surface_form":"M6","offset":128},{"uri":"Gravelly_Hill_Interchange","surface_form":"Gravelly Hill Interchange","offset":134},{"uri":"Central_Birmingham","surface_form":"Central Birmingham","offset":165},{"uri":"A38_road","surface_form":"A38 road","offset":234},{"uri":"Barrier","surface_form":"barrier","offset":298},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"Motorcycle","offset":434},{"uri":"Lane","surface_form":"lane","offset":473},{"uri":"Drain","surface_form":"drain","offset":486}]}
