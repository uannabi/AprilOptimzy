Alligators are also less aggressive than crocodilids. Usually only the largest of the species are a threat to humans.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":50},{"uri":"Crocodilia","surface_form":"crocodilia","offset":64},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genera","offset":107},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":132},{"uri":"Chinese_alligator","surface_form":"Chinese alligator","offset":210},{"uri":"American_Alligator","surface_form":"American Alligator","offset":277},{"uri":"Amazon_Rainforest","surface_form":"Amazon","offset":397},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"southern United States","offset":451},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":475},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":501},{"uri":"Yangzee_river","surface_form":"Yangzee river","offset":528},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":545},{"uri":"Snout","surface_form":"snout","offset":677},{"uri":"Saltwater","surface_form":"saltwater","offset":712},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":741},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":772},{"uri":"Tooth","surface_form":"tooth","offset":839},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":860}]}
