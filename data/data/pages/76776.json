{"id":76776,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Nikki","text":"\"Princess Nikki\" is a British reality television show that stars former Big Brother 7 UK house mate Nikki Grahame. It ran on Wednesday nights between 10:00 - 10:30pm on the digital and satellite television channel E4 from 6 September 2006, for a total runtime of 30 minutes. The show was devised by Endemol, the company that also devised Big Brother. It was narrated by the presenter and comedian, Alex Zane.\nThe format saw Grahame attempt several jobs on each show, which included various unpleasant tasks such as rubbish collecting, deep sea fishing, and waste management. The show's premise was to see whether or not she would perform the tasks given to her and keep her job for a day, or whether she would quit or be sacked due to her infamous tantrums. The concept of the show was taken from one of the tasks Nikki undertook while in the \"Big Brother\" house. During the task, she was assigned as Big Brother's personal assistant and had to carry out various duties, which often resulted in Nikki throwing a tantrum and refusing to comply.\nThe theme music for the programme has been adapted from the 1982 hit single \"Hey Mickey!\" by Toni Basil, with the lyrics \"Hey Nikki!\" used as a replacement.\nContrary to rumors, no second season is planned. Creative director Philip Edgar-Jones confirmed the series is finished in an interview with Brother's Bar.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":22},{"uri":"Big_Brother_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Big Brother","offset":72},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":86},{"uri":"Nikki_Grahame","surface_form":"Nikki Grahame","offset":100},{"uri":"Endemol","surface_form":"Endemol","offset":299},{"uri":"Alex_Zane","surface_form":"Alex Zane","offset":398},{"uri":"Waste_management","surface_form":"waste management","offset":557},{"uri":"Sacked","surface_form":"sacked","offset":721},{"uri":"Tantrum","surface_form":"tantrum","offset":748},{"uri":"Big_Brother_(TV_series)","surface_form":"Big Brother","offset":844},{"uri":"Hey_Mickey","surface_form":"Hey Mickey","offset":1121},{"uri":"Toni_Basil","surface_form":"Toni Basil","offset":1137},{"uri":"Philip_Edgar-Jones","surface_form":"Philip Edgar-Jones","offset":1268},{"uri":"Interview","surface_form":"interview","offset":1326}]}
