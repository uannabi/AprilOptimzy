{"id":767789,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helltaker","text":"\"Helltaker\" is a freeware indie puzzle-adventure game with dating sim elements that was designed by Polish developer vanripper (real name \u0141ukasz Piskorz), released on May 11, 2020 for Windows, macOS, Linux and SteamOS. It is described as \"[a] short game about sharply dressed demon girls.\"\nPlot.\nOne day, The Helltaker has a dream about making a harem of demon girls. When he wakes up, even though he knows Hell is a dangerous place, he decides to go to Hell, wanting to make a harem of demon girls in the real world.\nGameplay.\nThe player plays a series of puzzle stages, in which the player pushes stones and skeleton soldiers around a two-dimensional top-down grid, like in \"Sokoban\", while having a limited amount of turns, avoiding spike traps and collecting key items. After reaching the goal, the player reaches the demon girl of that stage, who will ask the player a question, of which the correct answer is based on her personality. If the player guesses the answer correctly, the demon girl becomes part of the player's demon harem. If the player guesses the answer incorrectly, a bad ending, such as death, will happen, taking the player back to the start of the stage.\nThe final boss level, which features the demon \"Judgement, the High Prosecutor\", includes phased bullet hell-like mechanics with chains across the screen.\nDevelopment.\n\u0141ukasz Piskorz, who is known on Twitter as \"vanripper\", developed the whole game by himself over an estimated time of one year, and was the game's artistic director. According to \u0141ukasz Piskorz, Helltaker is somewhat like the \"Leisure Suit Larry\" video game series because the main characters of both games have similar features to each other.\nThe game can be played for free, and an art book and the recipe for the pancakes that appear in the game are sold separately.\nAlthough the video game is only officially available in English, Piskorz has supported the translations made by the community, explaining how to make them and making one in Polish himself.\nReception.\nAs of 7 June 2020, the game has 21,143 reviews on Steam, with an overall rating of \"Overwhelmingly Positive\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["video game","album"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Freeware","surface_form":"freeware","offset":17},{"uri":"Indie_game","surface_form":"indie","offset":26},{"uri":"Puzzle_game","surface_form":"puzzle","offset":32},{"uri":"Adventure_game","surface_form":"adventure game","offset":39},{"uri":"Dating_sim","surface_form":"dating sim","offset":59},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish","offset":100},{"uri":"Demon","surface_form":"demon","offset":276},{"uri":"Harem","surface_form":"harem","offset":346},{"uri":"Hell","surface_form":"Hell","offset":407},{"uri":"Sokoban","surface_form":"Sokoban","offset":677},{"uri":"Bad_ending","surface_form":"bad ending","offset":1090},{"uri":"Leisure_Suit_Larry","surface_form":"Leisure Suit Larry","offset":1575},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1874},{"uri":"Polish_language","surface_form":"Polish","offset":1991}]}
