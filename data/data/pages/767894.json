{"id":767894,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_(tortoise)","text":"Diego is a giant tortoise from Hood Island (= Espa\u00F1ola Island). He was used to restock a Galapagos island with more giant tortoises.\nIt is likely he was hatched on Hood in the Gal\u00E1pagos before 1920. He was captured as a young adult and sent to the United States to be shown at zoos. By the late 1940s he was at San Diego Zoo in California. A captive breeding effort was set up in 1976 for the Hood Island tortoises.\nAt the time only 15 were known to be alive. Diego was sent to Santa Cruz Island to join the project. Diego had more than 900 offspring who were released on Espa\u00F1ola. These helped increase the number in the wild to more than 2,000. The breeding project ended in January 2020. Diego was then released into the wild in June 2020.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Giant_tortoise","surface_form":"giant tortoise","offset":11},{"uri":"Hood_Island","surface_form":"Hood Island","offset":31},{"uri":"Espa%C3%B1ola_Island","surface_form":"Espa\u00F1ola Island","offset":46},{"uri":"Galapagos","surface_form":"Galapagos","offset":89},{"uri":"Hatch","surface_form":"hatched","offset":153},{"uri":"Hood","surface_form":"Hood","offset":164},{"uri":"Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands","surface_form":"Gal\u00E1pagos","offset":176},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":248},{"uri":"Zoo","surface_form":"zoo","offset":277},{"uri":"San_Diego_Zoo","surface_form":"San Diego Zoo","offset":311},{"uri":"Captive_breeding","surface_form":"captive breeding","offset":342},{"uri":"Santa_Cruz_Island_(Gal%C3%A1pagos)","surface_form":"Santa Cruz Island","offset":478},{"uri":"Offspring","surface_form":"offspring","offset":541}]}
