The river starts in Rh\u00F4ne Glacier, which is in Switzerland. Then, the Rh\u00F4ne River joints the Sa\u00F4ne, in France (and other rivers) and ends in the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe River Rh\u00F4ne empties into the Mediterranean. Only the Nile brings more water into the Mediterranean. The river drains an area of 95.5500 m2. The usual amount of water is about 1.700 m3 per second (at Tarrascon). During floods, this value has reached over 12.000 m3 per second.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":15},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":24},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":35},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":79},{"uri":"Rh%C3%B4ne_Glacier","surface_form":"Rh\u00F4ne Glacier","offset":95},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":122},{"uri":"Sa%C3%B4ne","surface_form":"Sa\u00F4ne","offset":168},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":178},{"uri":"Mediterranean_Sea","surface_form":"Mediterranean Sea","offset":220},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":296},{"uri":"Tarrascon","surface_form":"Tarrascon","offset":442},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":461}]}
