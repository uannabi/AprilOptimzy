{"id":767942,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idle_game","text":"e=\"preserve\">Idle games (also known as clicker games) are a type of video game. They are played by doing simple things such as clicking on the screen to get in-game money. One popular idle game is \"Clicker Heroes\".\nIn some idle games, even the clicking is no longer needed after some time, as the game plays itself.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":68},{"uri":"Screen","surface_form":"screen","offset":143},{"uri":"Clicker_Heroes","surface_form":"Clicker Heroes","offset":198}]}
