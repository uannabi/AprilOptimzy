{"id":767949,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M49_motorway","text":"The M49 is a short motorway near Bristol, England. It links the M5 south of Bristol with the M4 at the Second Severn Crossing bridge. It is mainly used by traffic on the M5 travelling north who want to use the bridge into Wales. You can only get to the motorway from other motorways. There is one junction that has been built, but there are no links to nearby roads and therefore the junction is not open to the public.\nJunctions.\n!scope=col abbr=\"North-west bound\"|North-west bound exits (B carriageway)\n!scope=col abbr=\"South-east bound\"|South-east bound exits (A carriageway)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Controlled-access_highway","surface_form":"motorway","offset":19},{"uri":"Bristol","surface_form":"Bristol","offset":33},{"uri":"M5_motorway","surface_form":"M5","offset":64},{"uri":"M4_motorway","surface_form":"M4","offset":93},{"uri":"Second_Severn_Crossing","surface_form":"Second Severn Crossing","offset":103},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":222}]}
