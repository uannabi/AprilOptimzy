{"id":768078,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobinogs","text":"\"Bobinogs\" (original Welsh title: \"Bobinogi\") is a British children's television programme that was shown on CBeebies. It was first shown in Wales, and was first shown in the rest of the United Kingdom in 2003. At first, the series featured a child named Owen (played by David Bursey) and three characters living in his hat, who were inanimate when he was with them, but active when he was not with them. This was later changed so instead, the characters were then active (in cartoon form) from the start of the programme.\nThe three main characters play in a band. In most episodes, they try to solve a problem, then perform a song about it at the end. At one point in the episode, they find a clue to the problem's solution by looking through their \"bobinoculars\", which show video footage from the real world.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":21},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":70},{"uri":"CBeebies","surface_form":"CBeebies","offset":109},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":777}]}
