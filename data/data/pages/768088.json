{"id":768088,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooloola_sedge_frog","text":"The Cooloola sedge frog or Cooloola tree frog (\"Litoria cooloolensis\") is a small frog from eastern Australia. It lives in Queensland and on Fraser Island and North Stradbroke Island.\nThey are 3 cm long. They are green and brown with brown spots. Some of them have stripes to their eyes. The pupils of their eyes are sideways and open up and down. There is a little webbing on the front legs and more webbing on the hind legs.\nThese frogs live in lakes and streams near the ocean. They prefer bodies of water with lots of reeds.\nThey lay eggs on underwater plants. The tadpoles are gold with brown spots. They can grow to 5.5 cm long.\nThese frogs are endangered because human beings build things in the places where they live, because humans visit the lakes where they like to lay their legs, and because humans use up the water from the lakes and streams where they live.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":82},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":100},{"uri":"Fraser_Island","surface_form":"Fraser Island","offset":141},{"uri":"North_Stradbroke_Island","surface_form":"North Stradbroke Island","offset":159},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"places where they live","offset":703}]}
