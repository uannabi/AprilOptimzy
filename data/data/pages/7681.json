{"id":7681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child","text":"A child (plural form is children) is a person who is not an adult yet, or who has not reached puberty, which usually happens in adolescence. Sometimes, teenagers (between puberty and legal adulthood) are also called children. A baby that is not yet born is often called a child, too. A person can be called his or her parent's child, no matter how old he or she is. Some synonyms for the word 'child' are \"kid\", \"toddler\", \"bairn\", \"youngster\", \"boy\" or \"girl, lad\" or\" lass\", and\" youth. \"\nIn rich countries, children go to school. Small children may go to nursery school, or kindergarten. Playing with small toys and using their imaginations are important for child development. But often in a developing country, children sometimes work in factories or in the fields with their parents or guardians.\nWhen two people get married and one (or both) of them have children with someone else before this marriage, that child is called a \"step child\" by the child's non-birth parent. If both people had children, the children of each parent are \"step brothers\" or \"step sisters\" of each other. A child whose parent dies is an orphan. Orphans with no parent may be raised by grandparents or other relatives. Otherwise they may go to live in an orphanage. They may be adopted by another adult or couple wanting a child. They will then be able to grow up in a new family.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":9},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"person","offset":39},{"uri":"Adult","surface_form":"adult","offset":60},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":94},{"uri":"Adolescence","surface_form":"adolescence","offset":128},{"uri":"Baby","surface_form":"baby","offset":228},{"uri":"Synonym","surface_form":"synonyms","offset":371},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":525},{"uri":"Nursery","surface_form":"nursery","offset":558},{"uri":"Kindergarten","surface_form":"kindergarten","offset":577},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"Playing","offset":591},{"uri":"Toy","surface_form":"toy","offset":610},{"uri":"Child_development","surface_form":"child development","offset":662},{"uri":"Developing_country","surface_form":"developing country","offset":696},{"uri":"Child_labour","surface_form":"work","offset":735},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"married","offset":823},{"uri":"Birth","surface_form":"birth","offset":966},{"uri":"Parent","surface_form":"parent","offset":972},{"uri":"Orphan","surface_form":"orphan","offset":1122},{"uri":"Orphanage","surface_form":"orphanage","offset":1239},{"uri":"Adoption","surface_form":"adopted","offset":1262}]}
