{"id":768141,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland%27s_rock_frog","text":"Copland's rock frog, saxicoline tree frog, sandstone frog, rocky river frog or rock frog (\"Litoria coplandi\") is a frog from northern Australia. It lives in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.\nThis frog lives near rocky cliffs and steep slopes with large amounts of loose rock. During the day, it hides in caves or cracks in the rocks. At night, it looks for food near small streams.\nThese frogs are 4 cm in length. They are light brown with darker brown marks. Their front feet are not webbed. Their hind feet are webbed. These frogs are strong climbers and light enough to skip across the surface of the water like a skipping stone.\nThey lay eggs one at a time or a few at a time in small pools or streams where the water moves slowly. The eggs sink to the bottom. The tadpoles hatch after 52 days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":115},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":134}]}
