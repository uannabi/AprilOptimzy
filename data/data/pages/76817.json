Thus it looks at authors, sources, interpretation, style, bias, and audience. It is sometimes called \"the history of history\". The word historiography can also refer to a body of historical work.\nThe history of written history.\nFor thousands of years people have been telling stories about the past, and making written records of the actions of kings and prophets and other famous persons. After 500 BC, they began writing more organized histories.\nHellenic world.\nWritten history appeared first with the ancient Greeks, whose historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The very first historical works were \"The Histories\" composed by Herodotus of Halicarnassus (484 BC\u2013ca.425 BC), who became later known as the 'father of history' (Cicero).\nThucydides was the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, and his successor Xenophon (ca. 431\u2013355 BC) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his Anabasis.\nRoman world.\nThe Romans adopted the Greek tradition, becoming the first people to write history in a non-Greek language. The most famous writers are Julius Caesar's (100 BC\u201344 BC) \"Bellum Gallicum\".\nLivy (59 BC\u2013AD 17) who records the rise of Rome from city-state to world dominion.\nPlutarch (c. 46 - 127) and Suetonius (c. 69-after 130) introduced biography as a branch of history. Tacitus (c. 56\u2013c. 117) criticizes Roman immorality by praising German virtues.\nMedieval Europe.\nWriting history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the Middle Ages. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, the Church and of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers. In the Early Middles Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year but this style tended to hampered the analysis of events and causes. An example of this type of writing are Anglo-Saxon Chronicles which were the work of several different writers and start during the reign of Alfred the Great in the late 9th century and one copy of which was still being updated in 1154.\nHistory was written about states or nations during the Renaissance. The study of history changed during the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Voltaire described the history of certain ages that were important according to him, instead of describing events in a chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called \"philosophia historiae\" anymore, but merely history (\"historia\").\nModern era.\nModern historiography began with Leopold Ranke in the 19th century, who was very critical on the sources used in history.\nThe French Annales School radically changed history during the 20th century. Fernand Braudel wanted history to become more scientific by demanding more mathematical evidence in history, in order to make the history discipline less subjective. Furthermore, he added a social-economic and geographic framework to answer historical questions. Other French historians, like Philippe Ari\u00E8s and Michel Foucault described history of daily life topics such as death and sexuality. They wanted history to be written about all topics and that all questions should be asked.\nHistorical journals.\nHistorical journals for academic historians to exchange ideas started in the nineteenth century. The early journals were similar to the academic journals used in the physical sciences, and were seen as a means by which history could be professionalised. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was \"Annales. \u00C9conomies. Soci\u00E9t\u00E9s. Civilisations.\" a publication instrumental in establishing the Annales School.\nApproaches to history.\nThe question of how a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important questions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\nDeterminism.\nDeterminism means that historians view history as being caused more by certain factors than by other factors. The two most common types of determinism are geographic determinism and economic determinism. Geographic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by geography. Frederick Jackson Turner was a proponent of geographic determinism. Economic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by economics. Charles Beard was a proponent of economic determinism. Other historians believe that history is caused mostly by politics or mostly by a struggle for natural rights, but these are usually not labeled as determinism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":53},{"uri":"Historical_method","surface_form":"historical method","offset":76},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":113},{"uri":"Source","surface_form":"source","offset":122},{"uri":"Interpretation","surface_form":"interpretation","offset":131},{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":147},{"uri":"Bias","surface_form":"bias","offset":154},{"uri":"Audience","surface_form":"audience","offset":164},{"uri":"Story","surface_form":"stories","offset":372},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":441},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":451},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"ancient Greeks","offset":601},{"uri":"Histories_(Herodotus)","surface_form":"The Histories","offset":738},{"uri":"Herodotus","surface_form":"Herodotus of Halicarnassus","offset":765},{"uri":"484_BC","surface_form":"484 BC","offset":793},{"uri":"425_BC","surface_form":"425 BC","offset":803},{"uri":"Cicero","surface_form":"Cicero","offset":863},{"uri":"Thucydides","surface_form":"Thucydides","offset":872},{"uri":"Xenophon","surface_form":"Xenophon","offset":979},{"uri":"Anabasis","surface_form":"Anabasis","offset":1071},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":1230},{"uri":"Commentarii_de_Bello_Gallico","surface_form":"Bellum Gallicum","offset":1262},{"uri":"Livy","surface_form":"Livy","offset":1280},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Rome","offset":1323},{"uri":"Plutarch","surface_form":"Plutarch","offset":1363},{"uri":"Suetonius","surface_form":"Suetonius","offset":1390},{"uri":"Biography","surface_form":"biography","offset":1429},{"uri":"Tacitus","surface_form":"Tacitus","offset":1463},{"uri":"Immorality","surface_form":"immorality","offset":1503},{"uri":"Germanic_peoples","surface_form":"German","offset":1526},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":1627},{"uri":"Early_medieval","surface_form":"Early Middles Ages","offset":1768},{"uri":"Annals","surface_form":"annals","offset":1829},{"uri":"Chronicles","surface_form":"chronicles","offset":1839},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle","offset":1988},{"uri":"Alfred_the_Great","surface_form":"Alfred the Great","offset":2090},{"uri":"9th_century","surface_form":"9th century","offset":2119},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":2241},{"uri":"Age_of_Enlightenment","surface_form":"Enlightenment","offset":2294},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"Romanticism","offset":2312},{"uri":"Voltaire","surface_form":"Voltaire","offset":2325},{"uri":"Leopold_Ranke","surface_form":"Leopold Ranke","offset":2636},{"uri":"Annales_School","surface_form":"Annales School","offset":2736},{"uri":"Fernand_Braudel","surface_form":"Fernand Braudel","offset":2802},{"uri":"Philippe_Ari%C3%A8s","surface_form":"Philippe Ari\u00E8s","offset":3095},{"uri":"Michel_Foucault","surface_form":"Michel Foucault","offset":3114},{"uri":"Academic_journal","surface_form":"academic journal","offset":3446},{"uri":"Professional","surface_form":"professional","offset":3546},{"uri":"Annales_School","surface_form":"Annales School","offset":3779},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":4543},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":4699},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":4823},{"uri":"Natural_rights","surface_form":"natural rights","offset":4860}]}
