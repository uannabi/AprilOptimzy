{"id":768212,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleating_tree_frog","text":"The bleating tree frog (\"Litoria dentata\") is a frog from Australia. It lives in New South Wales and Queensland.\nThis frog lives in lagoons and swamps not far from the ocean and sometimes in forests. It has a very loud call similar to that of a cicada.\nThis frog grows to about 4.5 cm in length. It has a flatter body than most frogs. During the day, it hides under stones or pieces of treebark but sometimes in human-made objects. Human beings sometimes pick it up without knowing and move it from place to place while it is hiding in pipes or flowerpots.\nThis frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The eggs float on top of the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly so they do not die when their homes dry up.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":48},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":58},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":81},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":101},{"uri":"Cicada","surface_form":"cicada","offset":245}]}
