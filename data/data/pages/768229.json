This is called the Binet\u2013Simon test.\nIn 1905, the French Ministry of Education asked psychologist Alfred Binet to find which students did not learn effectively from regular classroom instruction. They could be given remedial work. With his collaborator Th\u00E9odore Simon, Binet published revisions of his test in 1908 and 1911, the last of which appeared just before his death.\nIn 1984, the journal \"Science\" 84 picked the Binet-Simon scale as one of twenty of the century's most significant developments or discoveries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Psychologist","surface_form":"psychologist","offset":60},{"uri":"IQ_test","surface_form":"IQ test","offset":106},{"uri":"Th%C3%A9odore_Simon","surface_form":"Th\u00E9odore Simon","offset":368},{"uri":"Science_(journal)","surface_form":"Science","offset":512}]}
