{"id":76825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_source","text":"A secondary source is a document or recording that writes or speaks about information that is one step removed from the original source.\nThe secondary source depends on the \"primary source\" or \"original source\" of the information. Secondary sources interpret, evaluate or discuss information found in primary sources. In historiography, a secondary source is a study written by a scholar about a topic. Secondary sources frequently cite primary sources and other secondary sources. They rarely cite tertiary sources.\nExample.\nA secondary source would be a book on 13th century politics, while the Magna Carta itself would be a primary source.\nMany secondary sources use extensive citations in the form of footnotes or endnotes.\nLegal use.\nThe main use of secondary sources in law is to explain the law. They also explain legal concepts. They are used to analyze and describe laws as well as comment on them. Judicial decisions and opinions by qualified experts are secondary sources.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Document","surface_form":"document","offset":24},{"uri":"Recording","surface_form":"recording","offset":36},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":74},{"uri":"Primary_source","surface_form":"primary source","offset":174},{"uri":"Interpretation","surface_form":"interpret","offset":249},{"uri":"Evaluate","surface_form":"evaluate","offset":260},{"uri":"Discussion","surface_form":"discuss","offset":272},{"uri":"Primary_source","surface_form":"primary source","offset":301},{"uri":"Historiography","surface_form":"historiography","offset":321},{"uri":"Cite","surface_form":"cite","offset":432},{"uri":"Tertiary_source","surface_form":"tertiary source","offset":499},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":577},{"uri":"Magna_Charta","surface_form":"Magna Carta","offset":597},{"uri":"Citation","surface_form":"citation","offset":680},{"uri":"Footnote","surface_form":"footnotes","offset":705},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":776},{"uri":"Expert","surface_form":"expert","offset":953}]}
