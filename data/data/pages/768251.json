These are called vomerine teeth. They have some webbing on their front feet and more webbing on their hind feet. There are five groups of \"Litoria eurynastes\" living in the wild and they are not all the same color. They can be bright green, yellow-green, or brownish-green. Some of them have gold or light green stripes down their bodies. There is a disc on each finger.\nThe Greek name \"eurynastes\" means \"wide-dwelling\", meaning living in many places.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":26},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":36},{"uri":"Litoria_bicolor","surface_form":"Litoria bicolor","offset":66}]}
