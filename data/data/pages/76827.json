{"id":76827,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breinigerberg","text":"Breinigerberg is a small village in the West of Germany, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia About 972 people live at the place. It is close to the \"Naturpark Nordeifel\", a large forest area in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nThe road L12 passes through Breinigerberg splitting it into two parts.\nIn the last two centuries, Breinigerberg was famous for mining. Even the ancient Romans dug for ore in the area. It was used for the production of brass in the city of Stolberg. Today there is no more mining but the remains are still present. Big holes in the Schlangenberg area prove what had been left from the past. Today the Schlangenberg is a natural reserve protecting rare flowers and insects.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Village","surface_form":"village","offset":25},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":48},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"state","offset":61},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":70},{"uri":"Naturpark_Nordeifel","surface_form":"Naturpark Nordeifel","offset":149},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":194},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":203},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":219},{"uri":"Century","surface_form":"centuries","offset":319},{"uri":"Mining","surface_form":"mining","offset":359},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":384},{"uri":"Ore","surface_form":"ore","offset":399},{"uri":"Stolberg","surface_form":"Stolberg","offset":471},{"uri":"Schlangenberg","surface_form":"Schlangenberg","offset":563}]}
