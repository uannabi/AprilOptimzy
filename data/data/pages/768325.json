{"id":768325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_tree_frog","text":"The brown tree frog, whistling tree frog, Ewing's tree frog, or southern brown tree frog (\"Litoria ewingii\") is a frog from Australia. It lives in southeastern Australia and Tasmania, but it also lives in New Zealand.\nAdults are about 3.0 to 5.0 cm long. Females are larger than males. It is light brown in colour with a lighter belly and some patterns. Its feet are usually not webbed. The ends of their toes have suckers for climbing.\nThis frog can live in marshes, grasslands or on mountains. It lays eggs 500-600 at a time on underwater plants in ponds, streams, dams, and ditches. It takes months for them to grow into frogs. Unlike most frogs, the brown tree frog can lay eggs at any time during the year.\nIn New Zealand, brown frog tadpoles often given to schoolchildren so they can watch the tadpoles become frogs. This frog is now an invasive specie in New Zealand because people set the young frogs free outside after the project is done. Once they are released, brown tree frogs can kill New Zealand frogs by eating all their food or by giving them diseases from other places.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":114},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":124},{"uri":"Tasmania","surface_form":"Tasmania","offset":174},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":205},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"invasive specie","offset":843}]}
