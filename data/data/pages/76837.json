{"id":76837,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system","text":"The visual system is the part of the nervous system which allows organisms to see.\nIt interprets the information from visible light to build a representation of the world surrounding the body. The visual system has the complex task of (re)constructing a three dimensional world from a two dimensional projection of that world. The psychological manifestation of visual information is known as visual perception.\nIntroduction.\nDifferent species are able to see different parts of the light spectrum; for example, bees can see into the ultraviolet, while pit vipers can accurately target prey with their infrared imaging sensors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":37},{"uri":"Visual_perception","surface_form":"see","offset":78},{"uri":"Visible_light","surface_form":"visible light","offset":118},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"body","offset":187},{"uri":"Visual_perception","surface_form":"visual perception","offset":393},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":436},{"uri":"Light_spectrum","surface_form":"light spectrum","offset":483},{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bee","offset":512},{"uri":"Ultraviolet","surface_form":"ultraviolet","offset":534},{"uri":"Pit_viper","surface_form":"pit viper","offset":553},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":602}]}
