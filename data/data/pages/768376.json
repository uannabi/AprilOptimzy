{"id":768376,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_series","text":"=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a divergent series is an infinite series that is not convergent, meaning that the infinite sequence of the partial sums of the series does not have a finite limit.\nIf a series converges, the individual terms of the series must approach zero. Thus any series in which the individual terms do not approach zero diverges. However, convergence is a stronger condition: not all series whose terms approach zero converge. A counterexample is the harmonic series\nformula_1\nThe divergence of the harmonic series was proven by the medieval mathematician Nicole Oresme.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":15},{"uri":"Series","surface_form":"series","offset":62},{"uri":"Limit_(mathematics)","surface_form":"limit","offset":185}]}
