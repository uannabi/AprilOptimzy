{"id":76848,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics","text":"e=\"preserve\">Pneumatics is the use of compressed air for mechanical motion. It has many uses.\nPneumatic transfer systems are employed in many industries to move powders and devices. Pneumatic devices are also used where electric motors cannot be used for safety reasons, such as deep in a mine where explosive dust or gases may be present.\nComparison to Hydraulics.\nBoth pneumatics and hydraulics are applications of fluid power. Pneumatics uses air, which is compressible, while hydraulics uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil or water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Compressed_air","surface_form":"compressed air","offset":38},{"uri":"Electric_motor","surface_form":"electric motor","offset":220},{"uri":"Safety","surface_form":"safety","offset":255},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":318},{"uri":"Hydraulics","surface_form":"hydraulics","offset":386},{"uri":"Fluid_power","surface_form":"fluid power","offset":417},{"uri":"Hydraulics","surface_form":"hydraulics","offset":480}]}
