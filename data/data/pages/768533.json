{"id":768533,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_Prison_escape","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish republicans as the Great Escape) took place on 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison thought to be one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe.\nIt held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during The Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack during the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison.\nThe escape was a propaganda material for the IRA. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Irish_republicanism","surface_form":"Irish republicans","offset":46},{"uri":"County_Antrim","surface_form":"County Antrim","offset":120},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":135},{"uri":"HM_Prison_Maze","surface_form":"HM Prison Maze","offset":153},{"uri":"The_Troubles","surface_form":"The Troubles","offset":368},{"uri":"Prison_escape","surface_form":"prison escape","offset":397},{"uri":"Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","surface_form":"Provisional Irish Republican Army","offset":429},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":551},{"uri":"Propaganda","surface_form":"propaganda","offset":709}]}
