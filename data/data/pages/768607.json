{"id":768607,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_road_numbering_scheme","text":"In Great Britain, roads are given a letter with 1-4 numbers after it. This is how they are named. The letter is the category of the road. There are two main types of categories: motorways (with the letter \"M\") and non-motorways. There are two types of non-motorways: A roads (with the letter \"A\") and B roads (with the letter \"B\"). A roads are more important than B roads. There are also a very small number of C roads.\nThis system only applies to the island of Great Britain. Northern Ireland and other islands have their own systems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":3},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":18},{"uri":"Categorization","surface_form":"category","offset":116},{"uri":"List_of_motorways_in_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"motorways","offset":178},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":452}]}
