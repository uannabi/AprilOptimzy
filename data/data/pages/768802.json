It succeeded the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik ASSR), which had been created on 14 October 1924 as a part of the mainly Turkic Uzbek SSR in the process of national delimitation in Soviet Central Asia. On 24 August 1990, the Tajik SSR declared sovereignty in its borders and was renamed the \"Republic of Tajikistan\" on 31 August 1991, then finally declaring independence from the Soviet Union just a bit more than a week after.\nJust like modern-day Tajikistan, it was bordered by Afghanistan to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kirghizia to the north, and China to the east. Pakistan was to its south, separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"republic","offset":214},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":231},{"uri":"1929","surface_form":"1929","offset":262},{"uri":"1991","surface_form":"1991","offset":270},{"uri":"Tajikistan","surface_form":"Tajikistan","offset":294},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"sovereign state","offset":321},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":426},{"uri":"Tajik_people","surface_form":"Tajik people","offset":518},{"uri":"Tajik_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic","offset":573},{"uri":"Turkic_people","surface_form":"Turkic","offset":696},{"uri":"Uzbek_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Uzbek SSR","offset":703},{"uri":"National_delimitation_in_the_Soviet_Union","surface_form":"national delimitation","offset":731},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistan","surface_form":"Afghanistan","offset":1055},{"uri":"Uzbek_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Uzbekistan","offset":1081},{"uri":"Kirghiz_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Kirghizia","offset":1105},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1133},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":1152},{"uri":"Wakhan_Corridor","surface_form":"Wakhan Corridor","offset":1203}]}
