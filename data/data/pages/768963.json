{"id":768963,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jervis_Bay_tree_frog","text":"The Jervis Bay tree frog (\"Litoria jervisiensis\") is a frog from Australia. It lives near the ocean in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. It does not live in Jervis Bay.\nThese frogs have yellow colouring where their front legs meet their bodies.\nThey live in eucalyptus forests, other forests, and on plants near streams. They also live on sandy dunes and lagoons near the ocean.\nUnlike other frogs that live in New South Wales, Jervis Bay tree frogs like to lay eggs in the cold parts of the year. They lay eggs in on underwater sticks. They take 12 weeks to transform into frogs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":55},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":65},{"uri":"Armpit","surface_form":"front legs meet their bodies","offset":223},{"uri":"Metamorphosis","surface_form":"transform","offset":567}]}
