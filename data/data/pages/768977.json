{"id":768977,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloons","text":"\"Bloons\" is a video game series. It is made by Ninja Kiwi.\nMaking.\nThe first \"Bloons\" game was made by Stephen and Chris Harris, who are two brothers from New Zealand. Before working on \"Bloons\", the brothers had released \"Cash Sprint\", which was a racing game. After \"Cash Sprint\" proved to be successful, the brothers made their own website for flash games. However, the site wasn\u2019t successful. The brothers decided to focus on making their own games, and made a website called Ninja Kiwi, which had five games when it opened. The site was a success, and this led to the brothers\u2019 work on \"Bloons\".\nThe basic concept for \"Bloons\" came from Stephen's wife. When Stephen asked her what would be fun in a new game, she talked about carnival games with darts and balloons. The first version of \"Bloons\" was developed quickly, and the game was released in April 2000. It proved popular, and soon reached nearly 100,000 players per day. By 2011, \"Bloons\" had been played over 3 billion times.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":14},{"uri":"Ninja_Kiwi","surface_form":"Ninja Kiwi","offset":47},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":155},{"uri":"Successful","surface_form":"successful","offset":295},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":335},{"uri":"Ninja_Kiwi","surface_form":"Ninja Kiwi","offset":480},{"uri":"Carnival_game","surface_form":"carnival game","offset":731},{"uri":"Darts","surface_form":"darts","offset":751},{"uri":"Balloons","surface_form":"balloons","offset":761}]}
