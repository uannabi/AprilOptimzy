The second of these frameworks (\"A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel\") led directly to the 1979 Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty.\nDue to the agreement, Sadat and Begin received the shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. The first framework (\"A Framework for Peace in the Middle East\"), which dealt with the Palestinian territories, was written without participation of the Palestinians and was condemned by the United Nations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_Egypt","surface_form":"Egyptian President","offset":69},{"uri":"Anwar_Sadat","surface_form":"Anwar Sadat","offset":88},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Israel","surface_form":"Israeli Prime Minister","offset":104},{"uri":"Menachem_Begin","surface_form":"Menachem Begin","offset":127},{"uri":"Camp_David","surface_form":"Camp David","offset":212},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":251},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":285},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":343},{"uri":"Jimmy_Carter","surface_form":"Jimmy Carter","offset":387},{"uri":"Egypt%E2%80%93Israel_Peace_Treaty","surface_form":"Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty","offset":535},{"uri":"Nobel_Peace_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Peace Prize","offset":625},{"uri":"Palestinian_territories","surface_form":"Palestinian territories","offset":731},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":835}]}
