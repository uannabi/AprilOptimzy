{"id":769096,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) were two rounds of bilateral conferences and corresponding international treaties involving the United States and the Soviet Union, the Cold War superpowers, on the issue of arms control.\nThe two rounds of talks and agreements were SALT I and SALT II.\nNegotiations commenced in Helsinki, Finland, in November 1969.\nSALT I led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an interim agreement between the two countries. Although SALT II resulted in an agreement in 1979, the United States Senate chose not to ratify the treaty in response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan.\nThe agreement expired on December 31, 1985 and was not renewed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bilateralism","surface_form":"bilateral","offset":75},{"uri":"International_treaties","surface_form":"international treaties","offset":115},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":152},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":174},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":192},{"uri":"Superpower","surface_form":"superpower","offset":201},{"uri":"Arms_control","surface_form":"arms control","offset":230},{"uri":"Helsinki","surface_form":"Helsinki","offset":334},{"uri":"Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty","surface_form":"Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty","offset":389},{"uri":"Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War","surface_form":"Soviet war in Afghanistan","offset":597}]}
