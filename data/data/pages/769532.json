{"id":769532,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzu_(emulator)","text":"Yuzu, stylized as yuzu, is a free and open-source emulator of the Nintendo Switch. Yuzu was announced to be in development on January 14, 2018, 10 months after the Nintendo Switch came out. It is developed in C++.\nThe emulator is made by the developers of the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra. Both programs use a lot of the same code. At first, Yuzu only supported test programs and homebrew, but as of July 2019, a small amount of games work without any issues. A list of games that work with Yuzu is updated on Yuzu's official website.\nFeatures.\nYuzu uses a network service called Boxcat instead of Nintendo's BCAT dynamic content network.\nYuzu allows the resolution to be changed to that of docked mode or undocked mode, or even higher than any of them.\nIn December 2019, Yuzu added an experimental Vulkan renderer to its Early Access build. As of April 2020, this Vulkan renderer is being used with MoltenVK to continue making Yuzu for MacOS because Apple discourages the use of OpenGL in MacOS.\nOn May 9, 2020, the development team announced an update that included experimental multi-core CPU emulation.\nReception.\nIn October 2018, \"Kotaku\" published an article saying \"Super Mario Odyssey\" was playable. The author of the article showed concern Yuzu could emulate games that were available commercially at the time.\n\"PC Gamer\" said Yuzu was able to run shortly after the games came out, but with audio issues.\nIn October 2019, Gizmodo published an article saying Yuzu could emulate some games at a frame rate at about the same speed as a real Nintendo Switch.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["software","information appliance"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Free_and_open-source_software","surface_form":"free and open-source","offset":29},{"uri":"Video_game_console_emulator","surface_form":"emulator","offset":50},{"uri":"Nintendo_Switch","surface_form":"Nintendo Switch","offset":66},{"uri":"C%2B%2B","surface_form":"C++","offset":209},{"uri":"Nintendo_3DS","surface_form":"Nintendo 3DS","offset":260},{"uri":"Citra_(emulator)","surface_form":"Citra","offset":282},{"uri":"Homebrew_(video_games)","surface_form":"homebrew","offset":379},{"uri":"Network_service","surface_form":"network service","offset":556},{"uri":"Display_resolution","surface_form":"resolution","offset":654},{"uri":"Vulkan_(API)","surface_form":"Vulkan","offset":798},{"uri":"MoltenVK","surface_form":"MoltenVK","offset":899},{"uri":"OpenGL","surface_form":"OpenGL","offset":979},{"uri":"Multi-core_processor","surface_form":"multi-core","offset":1080},{"uri":"Kotaku","surface_form":"Kotaku","offset":1135},{"uri":"Super_Mario_Odyssey","surface_form":"Super Mario Odyssey","offset":1172},{"uri":"PC_Gamer","surface_form":"PC Gamer","offset":1320},{"uri":"Gizmodo","surface_form":"Gizmodo","offset":1430},{"uri":"Frame_rate","surface_form":"frame rate","offset":1501}]}
