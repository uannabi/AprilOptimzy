{"id":76967,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer","text":"The Lord's Prayer is the best known prayer in the Christian religion. It is also known as the Our Father (the first two words of the prayer) and Pater noster (which is Latin for \"Our Father\"). It was not until the Protestant Reformation that it was called the Lord's Prayer.\nThe prayer is spoken in two places in the New Testament of the Bible (Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:1-4). Jesus' disciples asked him how they should pray. Jesus gave an example of how to pray to Father God.\nMusic.\nLuigi Cherubini, Martin Luther, Die Toten Hosen, Charles Gounod, Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek, Franz Liszt, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Otto Nicolai, Bernardino Rizzi, Igor Stravinsky, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Leonard Bernstein (in Mass), Giuseppe Verdi and Leonardo Schiavo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prayer","surface_form":"prayer","offset":36},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":50},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":168},{"uri":"Protestant_Reformation","surface_form":"Protestant Reformation","offset":214},{"uri":"New_Testament","surface_form":"New Testament","offset":317},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":338},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Matthew","surface_form":"Matthew","offset":345},{"uri":"Gospel_of_Luke","surface_form":"Luke","offset":364},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":378},{"uri":"Disciples_of_Christ","surface_form":"disciples","offset":385},{"uri":"God_the_Father","surface_form":"Father God","offset":467},{"uri":"Luigi_Cherubini","surface_form":"Luigi Cherubini","offset":486},{"uri":"Martin_Luther","surface_form":"Martin Luther","offset":503},{"uri":"Die_Toten_Hosen","surface_form":"Die Toten Hosen","offset":518},{"uri":"Charles_Gounod","surface_form":"Charles Gounod","offset":535},{"uri":"Leo%C5%A1_Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek","surface_form":"Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek","offset":551},{"uri":"Franz_Liszt","surface_form":"Franz Liszt","offset":565},{"uri":"Giacomo_Meyerbeer","surface_form":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","offset":578},{"uri":"Otto_Nicolai","surface_form":"Otto Nicolai","offset":597},{"uri":"Bernardino_Rizzi","surface_form":"Bernardino Rizzi","offset":611},{"uri":"Igor_Stravinsky","surface_form":"Igor Stravinsky","offset":629},{"uri":"Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky","surface_form":"Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky","offset":646},{"uri":"Leonard_Bernstein","surface_form":"Leonard Bernstein","offset":672},{"uri":"Mass_(Theater)","surface_form":"Mass","offset":694},{"uri":"Giuseppe_Verdi","surface_form":"Giuseppe Verdi","offset":701},{"uri":"Leonardo_Schiavo","surface_form":"Leonardo Schiavo","offset":720}]}
