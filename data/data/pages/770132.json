It was first held in 1934 in Turin.\nThe Championships have taken place every four years, with a few exceptions. Since 2010, they have been organised every two years. However in years where with the Summer Olympics, the marathon and racewalking events are held, the championships are cancelled.\nFrom 2018, European Championships not held in an Olympic year will form part of the European Championships.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Athletics_(sport)","surface_form":"athletics","offset":76},{"uri":"European_Athletics_Association","surface_form":"European Athletics Association","offset":109},{"uri":"Turin","surface_form":"Turin","offset":170},{"uri":"Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"Summer Olympics","offset":339},{"uri":"Marathon","surface_form":"marathon","offset":360},{"uri":"Racewalking","surface_form":"racewalking","offset":373},{"uri":"European_Championships_(Multi-Sport)","surface_form":"European Championships","offset":519}]}
