It was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1936. The candidates were Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his running mate John Nance Garner, and Republican Alf Landon of Kansas and his running mate, Frank Knox.\nThe results.\nRoosevelt, the incumbent president, was very popular. Many people liked his New Deal system. He won 48 states, 523 electoral votes and 27,476,000 votes. Landon, on the other hand, did not do well at all. He did not even win his home state of Kansas. He only won two states (Vermont and Maine), 8 electoral votes, and 16,679,000 votes.\nClose states.\nNew Hampshire, which is next to both Maine and Vermont, came within 2% of voting for Landon. That is, less than 2% more people voted for Roosevelt than Landon.\nLandon's home state, Kansas, came within 7.72% of supporting him. Other close states were Massachusetts (which came within 9.46% of supporting Landon) and Delaware (which came within 9.77% of supporting Landon).\nThe Republican primaries.\nUltimately, Landon easily won. He chose Knox as his running mate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"United States presidential election","offset":58},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":157},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
