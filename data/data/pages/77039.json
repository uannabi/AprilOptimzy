{"id":77039,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_gravity","text":"Specific Gravity (SG) is a special case of relative density.\nIt is defined as the ratio of the density of a given substance, to the density of water (H2O). Substances with a specific gravity greater than 1 are heavier than water, and those with a specific gravity of less than 1 are lighter than water.\nformula_1\nSG is by definition dimensionless and therefore not dependent on the system of units used (e.g. slugsft\u22123 or kgm\u22123), assuming that the units are consistent. Based on the SG-value of a given substance, the density of that substance can be calculated.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Relative_density","surface_form":"relative density","offset":43},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":95}]}
