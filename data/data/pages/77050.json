{"id":77050,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso","text":"Espresso is a type of Italian coffee that is concentrated. In order to make espresso, coffee beans are powdered and hot water is added under high pressure. This is done using an espresso machine or a macchinetta. Usually, espresso is made using 7\u00A0grams of coffee beans. This gives espresso a very strong flavor. Because espresso is so strong, it is usually mixed with other coffee drinks in small amounts.\nDrinks that use espresso.\nThere are many drinks that use espresso, such as latte, cappuccino, caffe mocha and caffe macchiato.\nAlternative spelling.\nIt is sometimes spelled expresso, with an X.
