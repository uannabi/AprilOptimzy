In 1784, the Italian Monte dei Paschi and Monte Pio banks were merged together as the Monti Reuniti. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company merged with it's competitor North West Company.\nAt present mergers and acquisitions between companies happen very commonly and there are separate private companies to help other companies enter into mergers like MergersCorp, BusinessBrokers and LinkBusiness.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"companies","offset":87},{"uri":"East_India_Company","surface_form":"East India Company","offset":255},{"uri":"Erstwhile","surface_form":"erstwhile","offset":281},{"uri":"Monte_dei_Paschi_di_Siena","surface_form":"Monte dei Paschi","offset":392},{"uri":"Monti_Reuniti","surface_form":"Monti Reuniti","offset":457},{"uri":"Hudson%27s_Bay_Company","surface_form":"Hudson's Bay Company","offset":485},{"uri":"North_West_Company","surface_form":"North West Company","offset":534},{"uri":"MergersCorp","surface_form":"MergersCorp","offset":718},{"uri":"BusinessBrokers","surface_form":"BusinessBrokers","offset":731},{"uri":"LinkBusiness","surface_form":"LinkBusiness","offset":751}]}
