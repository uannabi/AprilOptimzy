Board of Education\" declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, many American schools continued to remain largely segregated due to housing inequality.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Student_transport","surface_form":"transporting students to schools","offset":135},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"racial segregation","offset":242},{"uri":"U.S._Supreme_Court","surface_form":"U.S. Supreme Court","offset":288},{"uri":"Brown_v._Board_of_Education","surface_form":"Brown v.
