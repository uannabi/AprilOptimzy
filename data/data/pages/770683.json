Three 14-year-old girls and an 11-year-old girl were killed.\nFour members of a local Ku Klux Klan chapter planted at least 15 sticks of dynamite beneath the steps located on the east side of the church.\nAlthough the FBI had concluded in 1965 that the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing had been committed by four known Klansmen and segregationists: Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr., Herman Frank Cash, Robert Edward Chambliss, and Bobby Frank Cherry, no prosecutions were conducted until 1977.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"White_supremacy","surface_form":"white supremacist","offset":66},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":84},{"uri":"African_Americans","surface_form":"African-American","offset":116},{"uri":"16th_Street_Baptist_Church","surface_form":"16th Street Baptist Church","offset":133},{"uri":"Birmingham%2C_Alabama","surface_form":"Birmingham, Alabama","offset":163},{"uri":"Ku_Klux_Klan","surface_form":"Ku Klux Klan","offset":300},{"uri":"Dynamite","surface_form":"dynamite","offset":351},{"uri":"Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","surface_form":"FBI","offset":431},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"segregationist","offset":547},{"uri":"Thomas_Edwin_Blanton_Jr.","surface_form":"Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr.","offset":564},{"uri":"Herman_Frank_Cash","surface_form":"Herman Frank Cash","offset":590},{"uri":"Robert_Edward_Chambliss","surface_form":"Robert Edward Chambliss","offset":609},{"uri":"Bobby_Frank_Cherry","surface_form":"Bobby Frank Cherry","offset":638}]}
