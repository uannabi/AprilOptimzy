{"id":770698,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litoria_megalops","text":"\"Litoria megalops\" is a frog from Indonesia. Scientists saw it on the western half of the island of New Guinea, in Indonesia's Papua Province. It is related to \"L. becki\", \"L. micromembrana\" and \"L. modica\".\nMale adult frogs are about 2.7 to 2.8 cm long and females are 3.2 to 3.6 cm long. This frog has very large eyes for its size, which is why scientists named it \"megalops\", which means \"large eyes\". Its front feet are not webbed, but its hind feet are. It has teeth on its upper jaw. Some of the frogs are the yellow-brown color of amber with a green mark over each eye and a green stripe on the body, and some are bright orange in color.\nScientists found this frog living 1070 meters above sea level. It was found only in the fast-flowing parts of the Wapona River, so they call it a torrent-dwlling frog. The scientists checked slow-flowing streams nearby and saw that this frog did not live in them.\nThis frog has clear eggs. It lays its eggs underneath rocks at the bottoms of streams. The tadpoles have flattened bodies and suckers on their mouths..","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":24},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":34},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":100},{"uri":"Beck%27s_tree_frog","surface_form":"L. becki","offset":161},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":485},{"uri":"Amber","surface_form":"amber","offset":538}]}
