{"id":7707,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy","text":"A boy is a young male human, either a child or teenager. Little boys still have the body of a child. It is not until they reach puberty (adolescence) (which starts at age 13 on average) that their bodies start to mature and they become a man.\nThe word \u201Cboy\u201D was used a long time ago in Anglo-Saxon English. The opposite of a boy is a girl.\nCulture.\nThe way boys are brought up will be vary a lot between different cultures. Boys are supposed to be tougher than girls. It is their job to do work which is physically hard, including fighting in the army when they are grown up. However, people\u2019s attitudes are changing and nowadays many girls like to do the same things as boys. In Western cultures boys traditionally wear trousers (pants) while girls wear dresses or skirts. However, many girls also wear trousers these days, like boys, especially when dressed informally. Boys often have shorter hair than girls, although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions.\nTraditionally boys like rough games (such as soccer or rugby) and enjoy playing with mechanical things such as toy cars and trains. People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that, or because that is the way society expects them to behave.\nThe traditional colour for a boy is blue. For girls it is pink. When a baby is born in a hospital it usually gets a blue or pink tag on its wrist or ankle, according to whether it is a boy or a girl.\nNames.\nSome names are boys\u2019 names, others are girls\u2019 names. There are some names which can be for boys and girls (although they may be spelt differently, e.g. \u201CLesley\u201D for a boy and \u201CLeslie\u201D for a girl).\nIn some countries such as Britain an \u201Cold boy\u201D means a grown up who used to be a pupil at a particular school (e.g. \u201CHe is an old boy of Cransbury High School\u201D). The expression can also be used in a very informal, friendly way, e.g. \u201CNice to see you, old boy!\u201D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":17},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":22},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":38},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenager","offset":47},{"uri":"Puberty","surface_form":"puberty","offset":128},{"uri":"Man","surface_form":"man","offset":238},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":286},{"uri":"Opposite","surface_form":"opposite","offset":311},{"uri":"Girl","surface_form":"girl","offset":334},{"uri":"Army","surface_form":"army","offset":547},{"uri":"Trousers","surface_form":"trousers","offset":721},{"uri":"Dress","surface_form":"dress","offset":755},{"uri":"Skirt","surface_form":"skirt","offset":766},{"uri":"Soccer","surface_form":"soccer","offset":1027},{"uri":"Rugby_football","surface_form":"rugby","offset":1037},{"uri":"Mechanism","surface_form":"mechanical","offset":1067},{"uri":"Train","surface_form":"train","offset":1106},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":1231},{"uri":"Blue","surface_form":"blue","offset":1299},{"uri":"Pink","surface_form":"pink","offset":1321},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":1352},{"uri":"Wrist","surface_form":"wrist","offset":1403},{"uri":"Ankle","surface_form":"ankle","offset":1412},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":1693}]}
