It has a long body and a pointed nose and only a little webbing on its feet. It is brown with black stripes and other black marks. It has ridges on its back.\nThis frog lives on the ground in tropical forests and in streams, swamps and ponds. It lives in the southern part of the island of New Guinea, in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It lives all across the northern and eastern coasts of Australia and people have seen it as far south as Sydney. It is known for being able to jump very far. It has longer cartilage in its toes than most frogs have, which may be why it jumps so well. This frog can jump 4 metres (>12 feet).\nThis frog lays 50-100 eggs at a time. The females lay eggs in groups that float on top of the water. Tadpoles can grow into frogs in 6 months.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":112},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":122},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":150},{"uri":"Indonesia","surface_form":"Indonesia","offset":504},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":518},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":641},{"uri":"Cartilage","surface_form":"cartilage","offset":708}]}
