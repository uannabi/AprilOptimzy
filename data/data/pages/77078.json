{"id":77078,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB","text":"Mero\u00EB (Meroitic: \"Medewi\" or \"Bedewi\") is the name of an ancient city. What remains of the city is on the east bank of the Nile about 6 km north-east of the Kabushiya station near Shendi, Sudan. It lies about 200 km north-east of Khartoum.\nThere are a few villages nearby. They are called Bagrawiyah.\nMero\u00EB was the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries. The Kushitic Kingdom of Mero\u00EB gave its name to the \"Island of Mero\u00EB\", which was the modern region of Butana, a region bounded by the Nile (from the Atbarah River to Khartoum), the Atbarah, Ethiopia, and the Blue Nile. The city of Mero\u00EB was on the edge of Butana and there were two other Meroitic cities in Butana, Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa.\nThe site of the city of Mero\u00EB is marked by over two hundred pyramids in three groups. Of many of these pyramids, there are only ruins left.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Meroitic_language","surface_form":"Meroitic","offset":7},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":65},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":123},{"uri":"Shendi","surface_form":"Shendi","offset":180},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":188},{"uri":"Khartoum","surface_form":"Khartoum","offset":230},{"uri":"Kush","surface_form":"Kush","offset":341},{"uri":"Butana","surface_form":"Butana","offset":470},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":502},{"uri":"Atbarah_River","surface_form":"Atbarah River","offset":517},{"uri":"Khartoum","surface_form":"Khartoum","offset":534},{"uri":"Blue_Nile","surface_form":"Blue Nile","offset":576},{"uri":"Butana","surface_form":"Butana","offset":624},{"uri":"Meroitic","surface_form":"Meroitic","offset":656},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":773}]}
