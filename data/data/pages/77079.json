{"id":77079,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe-Eisenach","text":"Saxe-Eisenach () was the name of three different Ernestine duchies that existed at different times in Thuringia. The chief town and capital of all three duchies was Eisenach.\nHistory.\nThe first Duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was created in 1596 for Johann Ernst, younger son of Johann Frederick II of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach.\nIn 1633, the Wettin line died out, and Johann Ernst inherited it, but he died heirless in 1638, and the territories of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Eisenach were split between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Altenburg.\nIn 1640 Saxe-Eisenach was again separated off from Saxe-Weimar for Albert, son of John II of Saxe-Weimar, but after just four years he too died without an heir, and Saxe-Eisenach was then divided between Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar, ruled by his brothers Ernst and Wilhelm.\nIn 1662 Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar died, leaving four children: Johann Ernst, Adolf Wilhelm, Johann Georg and Bernhard. Adolf Wilhelm, got Eisenach, but he had to share this with his younger brother Johann Georg. Johann Georg eventually took an allowance from the duchy instead of taking part in the government, and moved to live in the small town of Marksuhl. Adolf William\u2019s first four sons died soon after birth. In 1668 he died, just before of the birth of his fifth child, Wilhelm August, who became the new Duke of Saxe-Eisenach from his birth, with Johann Georg as regent. A sickly boy, he died in 1671 at only two years old, and Johann Georg I became the duke of Saxe-Eisenach.\nSaxe-Eisenach changed again in 1672. Frederick William III of Saxe-Altenburg died and his lands were split. The line of Johann Georg I ruled Saxe-Eisenach for 69 years, until Duke Wilhelm Heinrich died heirless in 1741. Ernst August I of Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm's second cousin, inherited Saxe-Eisenach; he and his successors ruled Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach in a personal union until 1809, when the duchies were formally merged into the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\nFirst creation.\nCreated in 1572 as Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach\n1596 divided into Saxe-Coburg and Saxe-Eisenach\nDivided between Saxe-Altenburg and Saxe-Weimar\nSecond creation.\nDivided between Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar\nPersonal union with Saxe-Weimar.\nMerged with Saxe Weimar into Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ernestine_duchies","surface_form":"Ernestine duchies","offset":49},{"uri":"Thuringia","surface_form":"Thuringia","offset":102},{"uri":"Eisenach%2C_Germany","surface_form":"Eisenach","offset":165},{"uri":"Johann_Ernst%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Eisenach","surface_form":"Johann Ernst","offset":241},{"uri":"Johann_Frederick_II%2C_Duke_of_Saxony","surface_form":"Johann Frederick II","offset":270},{"uri":"Saxe-Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Gotha","offset":434},{"uri":"Saxe-Altenburg","surface_form":"Saxe-Altenburg","offset":498},{"uri":"Albert_IV%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Eisenach","surface_form":"Albert","offset":581},{"uri":"John_II%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Weimar","surface_form":"John II","offset":596},{"uri":"Ernest_I%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Gotha","surface_form":"Ernst","offset":768},{"uri":"Wilhelm%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Weimar","surface_form":"Wilhelm","offset":778},{"uri":"Wilhelm%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Weimar","surface_form":"Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar","offset":795},{"uri":"Johann_Ernst_II%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Weimar","surface_form":"Johann Ernst","offset":853},{"uri":"Adolf_Wilhelm%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Eisenach","surface_form":"Adolf Wilhelm","offset":867},{"uri":"John_George_I%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Eisenach","surface_form":"Johann Georg","offset":882},{"uri":"Bernhard_II%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Jena","surface_form":"Bernhard","offset":899},{"uri":"Marksuhl","surface_form":"Marksuhl","offset":1140},{"uri":"William_August%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Eisenach","surface_form":"Wilhelm August","offset":1267},{"uri":"Regent","surface_form":"regent","offset":1361},{"uri":"Frederick_Wilhelm_III%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Altenburg","surface_form":"Frederick William III","offset":1512},{"uri":"Saxe-Altenburg","surface_form":"Saxe-Altenburg","offset":1537},{"uri":"Wilhelm_Heinrich%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Eisenach","surface_form":"Wilhelm Heinrich","offset":1655},{"uri":"Ernest_August_I%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Weimar","surface_form":"Ernst August I","offset":1695},{"uri":"Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach","surface_form":"Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach","offset":1922},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach","offset":1979},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg","offset":2018},{"uri":"Saxe-Altenburg","surface_form":"Saxe-Altenburg","offset":2064},{"uri":"Saxe-Weimar","surface_form":"Saxe-Weimar","offset":2083},{"uri":"Saxe-Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Gotha","offset":2128},{"uri":"Saxe-Weimar","surface_form":"Saxe-Weimar","offset":2143},{"uri":"Saxe_Weimar","surface_form":"Saxe Weimar","offset":2200},{"uri":"Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach","surface_form":"Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach","offset":2217}]}
