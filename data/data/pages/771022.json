{"id":771022,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machynlleth","text":"Machynlleth, sometimes known locally as just \"Mach\", is a historic market town, community and electoral ward in the county of Powys in Wales. It is inside the historic boundaries of Montgomeryshire.\nMachynlleth was the seat of Owain Glynd\u0175r's Welsh Parliament in 1404, and because of this, says it is the \"ancient capital of Wales\". However, it has never held any official recognition as a capital. It applied for city status in 2000 and 2002, but was unsuccessful.\nWelsh is spoken by many as well as English. The 2011 Census found that 67% of the town's people had some knowledge of the Welsh language, with 39% able to read, write and speak the language.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Market_town","surface_form":"market town","offset":67},{"uri":"Ward_(electoral_subdivision)","surface_form":"electoral ward","offset":94},{"uri":"Powys","surface_form":"Powys","offset":126},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":135},{"uri":"Montgomeryshire","surface_form":"Montgomeryshire","offset":182},{"uri":"Owain_Glynd%C5%B5r","surface_form":"Owain Glynd\u0175r","offset":227},{"uri":"City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"city status","offset":414},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":429},{"uri":"2002","surface_form":"2002","offset":438},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":466},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":501}]}
