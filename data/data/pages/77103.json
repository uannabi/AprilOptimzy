{"id":77103,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy","text":"A trophy is an object given to someone because of an accomplishment. These are often given out through sporting events.\nA trophy can be in the shape of a cup, a bowl, a plaque, a mug (these usually painted or engraved with something), a human shape (like the Emmy Award), or a spaceship (like the Hugo Award for science-fiction).\nTrophies can also be an animal head. These are often taken as trophies by hunters.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times people would take heads or other body parts of enemies they had killed in a battle to show how good a warrior they were.\nMany years ago (in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome) the winners did not get any trophy, only a wreath (a wreath is made of flowers and looks like a crown). The winner also got olive oil in a container that was similar to today trophies. In local games, the winners got different trophies, such as a vase or a silver cup.\nIn ancient Rome, the tradition of getting trophy was slowly forgotten and money were given instead.\nTrophies were introduced back in the world on large scale in last century. Football, rugby and baseball trophies were introduced.\nToday trophies are mostly made from plastic and are easily accessible to public thanks to low price.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sporting_event","surface_form":"sporting event","offset":103},{"uri":"Cup","surface_form":"cup","offset":154},{"uri":"Bowl","surface_form":"bowl","offset":161},{"uri":"Plaque","surface_form":"plaque","offset":169},{"uri":"Mug","surface_form":"mug","offset":179},{"uri":"Emmy_Award","surface_form":"Emmy Award","offset":259},{"uri":"Spaceship","surface_form":"spaceship","offset":277},{"uri":"Hugo_Award","surface_form":"Hugo Award","offset":297},{"uri":"Hunter","surface_form":"hunter","offset":404},{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"Ancient Greece","offset":579},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Ancient Rome","offset":598},{"uri":"Winner","surface_form":"winner","offset":616},{"uri":"Olive_oil","surface_form":"olive oil","offset":736},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"container","offset":751},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"ancient Rome","offset":884},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":955},{"uri":"Football","surface_form":"Football","offset":1056},{"uri":"Rugby_football","surface_form":"rugby","offset":1066},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":1076},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":1147}]}
