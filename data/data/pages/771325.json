{"id":771325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid","text":"e=\"preserve\">Medicaid in the United States is a federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, including nursing home care and personal care services.\nMedicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to 74 million low-income and disabled people (23% of Americans) as of 2017.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, states had the option to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly all low-income people under the age of 65. Eligibility for children was extended to at least 133% of the federal poverty level, and states now have the option to cover adults with income levels at or below 133% of the federal poverty level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medicare_(United_States)","surface_form":"Medicare","offset":209}]}
