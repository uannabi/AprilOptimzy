{"id":771328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Medicare is a national health insurance program in the United States. It began in 1965 under the Social Security Administration (SSA) by Lyndon B. Johnson and now administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). It gives health care insurance for Americans aged 65 and older, but also for some younger people with disability.\nMedicare Parts A and B include coverage for addiction treatment, including alcohol rehab. According to Medicare Interactive, a website that provides information on Medicare plans, Medicare Part A can help pay for hospitalization for substance abuse treatment, while Part B can help cover treatment for partial hospitalization or outpatient addiction treatment services.\nIn addition, Medicare Part D provides coverage for medications used in treating alcohol addiction, such as naltrexone, as long as these drugs are considered medically necessary for the policyholder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Health_insurance","surface_form":"health insurance","offset":36},{"uri":"Social_Security_Administration","surface_form":"Social Security Administration","offset":110},{"uri":"Lyndon_B._Johnson","surface_form":"Lyndon B.
