{"id":771541,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Vintorez","text":"The VSS, also called the Vintorez, is a sniper rifle featuring a built-in suppresor (similar to that of the AS-Val) the weapon is loaded with heavy subsonic 9\u00D739mm SP5 cartridges and armor-piercing SP6 cartridges. It was manufactured (created) by the Soviet company TsNIITochMash during the late 1980s. It is issued primarily to Spetsnaz units for secretive operations, a role made evident by its ability to be broken down for transport in a specially fitted case.\nDesign.\nThe way the gun operates and the silencer system used on the VSS are come from the AS assault rifle. The VSS is a gas-operated select-fire rifle. It has a long-stroke gas piston operating rod in a gas cylinder above the barrel. The weapon catch is held in its place thanks to a rotating bolt who attach themselves to the appropiate socket when needed. The VSS is striker fired. It features a cross-bolt type fire selector switch located behind the trigger, inside the trigger guard; the safety lever and the charging handle resemble those used in Kalashnikov weapons.\nThe skeletonized wooden stock is a more rounded version of that provided on the SVD rifle; it has a rubber shoulder pad and can be removed when the rifle is dismantled for compact storage. The forward handguard is made from a high-impact polymer. If needed, the weapon can be used in fully automatic mode using either its original 10-round magazine or the 20-round magazines from the AS rifle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sniper_rifle","surface_form":"sniper rifle","offset":40},{"uri":"Suppressor","surface_form":"suppresor","offset":74},{"uri":"AS-Val","surface_form":"AS-Val","offset":108},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":120},{"uri":"Subsonic","surface_form":"subsonic","offset":148},{"uri":"Spetsnaz","surface_form":"Spetsnaz","offset":329},{"uri":"AS-Val","surface_form":"AS assault rifle","offset":556},{"uri":"Accuracy_and_precision","surface_form":"select-fire","offset":600},{"uri":"Kalashnikov","surface_form":"Kalashnikov","offset":1020},{"uri":"Wooden_stock","surface_form":"wooden stock","offset":1058},{"uri":"SVD_rifle","surface_form":"SVD rifle","offset":1121},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":1279},{"uri":"AS-Val","surface_form":"AS rifle","offset":1425}]}
