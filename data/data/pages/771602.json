It was first revealed at the 1981 Geneva Auto Show along with the new-at-the-time Lamborghini Jalpa.\nThe LM001 was made for military use, but only one prototype was ever made. This was because the rear-engine design made the car handle poorly.\nHistory.\nEven though the previously made Lamborghini Cheetah was a failure, Lamborghini still wanted to make an off-road military vehicle. The Cheetah concept was redesigned into the LM001. Unlike the Cheetah's Chrysler engine, the LM001 prototype had a 134 kW 5.9-litre AMC-built V8. The V12 from the Countach was supposed to be used for production models.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lamborghini","surface_form":"Lamborghini","offset":53},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Jalpa","surface_form":"Lamborghini Jalpa","offset":156},{"uri":"Prototype","surface_form":"prototype","offset":225},{"uri":"Rear-engine","surface_form":"rear-engine","offset":271},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Cheetah","surface_form":"Lamborghini Cheetah","offset":359},{"uri":"Chrysler_Corporation","surface_form":"Chrysler","offset":529},{"uri":"American_Motors_Corporation","surface_form":"AMC","offset":589},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Countach","surface_form":"Countach","offset":620}]}
