These services are between London, England's capital city, and various other towns and cities around Great Britain. These include direct trains to Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, Chester and Blackpool. They also operate services between London and Holyhead, Wrexham or Bangor in North Wales.\nThere are currently plans for future services to Walsall, Llandudno Junction and the village of Gobowen in Shropshire from 2022.\nJourneys with Avanti are very popular with commuters as the trains do not call at every station and only stop at some stations along their route. However, due to this, tickets for travel with them can be expensive.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":23},{"uri":"West_Coast_Partnership","surface_form":"West Coast Partnership","offset":72},{"uri":"Virgin_Trains","surface_form":"Virgin Trains","offset":165},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":204},{"uri":"FirstGroup","surface_form":"FirstGroup","offset":227},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":242},{"uri":"Trenitalia","surface_form":"Trenitalia","offset":258},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":298},{"uri":"West_Coast_Main_Line","surface_form":"West Coast Main Line","offset":353},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":402},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":410},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":476},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":522},{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":534},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":545},{"uri":"Glasgow","surface_form":"Glasgow","offset":557},{"uri":"Edinburgh","surface_form":"Edinburgh","offset":566},{"uri":"Wolverhampton","surface_form":"Wolverhampton","offset":577},{"uri":"Shrewsbury","surface_form":"Shrewsbury","offset":592},{"uri":"Chester","surface_form":"Chester","offset":604},{"uri":"Blackpool","surface_form":"Blackpool","offset":616},{"uri":"Holyhead","surface_form":"Holyhead","offset":673},{"uri":"Wrexham","surface_form":"Wrexham","offset":683},{"uri":"Bangor%2C_Gwynedd","surface_form":"Bangor","offset":694},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":710},{"uri":"Walsall","surface_form":"Walsall","offset":766},{"uri":"Llandudno_Junction","surface_form":"Llandudno Junction","offset":775},{"uri":"Gobowen","surface_form":"Gobowen","offset":813},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":824}]}
