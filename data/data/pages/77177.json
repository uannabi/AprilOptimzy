{"id":77177,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work","text":"e=\"preserve\">Shift work is a working practice which is designed to use all 24 hours of a day, and not only the standard working day hours.\nA day for example can be divided into three eight-hour shifts. An employee only works one of the shifts in each day. The \"first shift\" is in the morning, the \"second shift\" is in the afternoon and evening and the \"third shift\" is overnight.\nThe \"second shift\", also known as the \"swing shift\" in some places, is the work shift which takes place in the afternoon and evening. It usually extends from 4 PM (16:00) to midnight, or from 3 PM (15:00) to 11 PM (23:00).\nThe \"third shift\", the \"night shift\", is usually from 11 PM (23:00) or 12-midnight (00:00) to 07:00 or 08:00 in the morning.\nHealth effects.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) decided in December 2007 that shift work, especially work at night, may cause cancer.\nA study by Knutsson \"et al.\" in 1986 showed that people who work shift work for more than 15 years, are 3 times more likely to develop ischaemic heart diseases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Working_day","surface_form":"working day","offset":120},{"uri":"Employee","surface_form":"employee","offset":205},{"uri":"World_Health_Organization","surface_form":"World Health Organization","offset":748},{"uri":"1986","surface_form":"1986","offset":898},{"uri":"Ischaemic_heart_disease","surface_form":"ischaemic heart disease","offset":1001}]}
