In 1996, it was abolished and four new unitary authorities were created. These were Wrexham County Borough, Conwy County Borough, Denbighshire, and Flintshire. Clwyd became a preserved county.\nIt was situated in the north-east of Wales. To the north, it bordered the Irish Sea. To the north-east, it shared a maritime border with the English county of Merseyside, across the River Dee. To the east, it bordered Cheshire and bordered Shropshire to the south-east, both also in England. To the south, it bordered Powys and bordered Gwynedd to the west.\nClwyd's county town was Mold, which is today part of Flintshire. The county's largest town was Wrexham, which is today its own borough.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Preserved_counties_of_Wales","surface_form":"preserved counties","offset":47},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":69},{"uri":"River_Clwyd","surface_form":"River Clwyd","offset":123},{"uri":"Unitary_authority","surface_form":"unitary authorities","offset":199},{"uri":"Wrexham_County_Borough","surface_form":"Wrexham County Borough","offset":244},{"uri":"Conwy_County_Borough","surface_form":"Conwy County Borough","offset":268},{"uri":"Denbighshire","surface_form":"Denbighshire","offset":290},{"uri":"Flintshire","surface_form":"Flintshire","offset":308},{"uri":"Irish_Sea","surface_form":"Irish Sea","offset":427},{"uri":"Maritime_border","surface_form":"maritime border","offset":469},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":494},{"uri":"Merseyside","surface_form":"Merseyside","offset":512},{"uri":"River_Dee","surface_form":"River Dee","offset":535},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":571},{"uri":"Shropshire","surface_form":"Shropshire","offset":593},{"uri":"Powys","surface_form":"Powys","offset":671},{"uri":"Gwynedd","surface_form":"Gwynedd","offset":690},{"uri":"Mold%2C_Flintshire","surface_form":"Mold","offset":735},{"uri":"Flintshire","surface_form":"Flintshire","offset":764},{"uri":"Wrexham","surface_form":"Wrexham","offset":806}]}
