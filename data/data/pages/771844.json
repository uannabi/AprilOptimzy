It is run by a group of universities working with the California Academy of Sciences: San Francisco State University, the University of California at Berkeley, University of Florida at Gainesville, and University of Texas at Austin.\nAmphibiaWeb's goal is to provide an information page for every species of amphibian in the world so research scientists, citizen scientists and people who want to help the environment can work together. It added its 7000th animal in 2012, a glass frog from Peru. As of 2020, it hosted more than 8,000 species from all over the world.\nBeginning.\nAmphibiaWeb was founded by the Digital Library Project at the University of California at Berkeley in 2000. It was a class project.\nUses.\nAmphibiaWeb gives information to the IUCN, CalPhotos, Encyclopedia of Life and iNaturalist.\nProfessional scientists use AmphibiaWeb in their papers. It has been cited in many journals, for example \"PLOS One\", \"The European Journal of Taxonomy\", \"Amino Acids\" and \"The Journal of Ethnopharmacology\".\nMany libraries recommend AmphibiaWeb to readers, including UNLV University Libraries, Stony Brook University Libraries, the College of Wooster Libraries and James Cook University Libraries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Amphibians","surface_form":"amphibians","offset":75},{"uri":"Frogs","surface_form":"frogs","offset":99},{"uri":"Salamanders","surface_form":"salamanders","offset":109},{"uri":"California_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"California Academy of Sciences","offset":176},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":208},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"University of California at Berkeley","offset":244},{"uri":"University_of_Florida","surface_form":"University of Florida","offset":282},{"uri":"University_of_Texas_at_Austin","surface_form":"University of Texas at Austin","offset":324},{"uri":"Citizen_science","surface_form":"citizen scientists","offset":476},{"uri":"Conservationists","surface_form":"people who want to help the environment","offset":499},{"uri":"Glass_frog","surface_form":"glass frog","offset":596},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":612},{"uri":"IUCN","surface_form":"IUCN","offset":875},{"uri":"Encyclopedia_of_Life","surface_form":"Encyclopedia of Life","offset":892},{"uri":"INaturalist","surface_form":"iNaturalist","offset":917},{"uri":"PLOS_One","surface_form":"PLOS One","offset":1036},{"uri":"UNLV_University","surface_form":"UNLV University","offset":1196},{"uri":"Stony_Brook_University","surface_form":"Stony Brook University","offset":1223},{"uri":"James_Cook_University","surface_form":"James Cook University","offset":1294}]}
