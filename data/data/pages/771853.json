{"id":771853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peron%27s_tree_frog","text":"Peron's tree frog or emerald-spotted tree frog (\"Litoria peronii\") is a frog from Australia. It lives in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, but people have also seen it in a few other places.\nThe adult frog is 6.0 cm long. It lives in forests, grasslands and swamps. It has sometimes been seen in northwestern Australia, far from its natural range. Citizen scientists from Frogwatch SA think this is because people keep Peron's tree frogs as pets and then they either escape or are set free. This frog is usually gray-green during the day. It turns red-brown with green spots at night. It has black and yellow colouring on its legs. It looks very similar to Tyler's tree frog. Scientists tell them apart because their voices sound different.\nThis frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The tadpoles are yellow with stripes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":72},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":82},{"uri":"Victoria","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":105},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":115},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":135},{"uri":"FrogWatch","surface_form":"Frogwatch SA","offset":380},{"uri":"Tyler%27s_tree_frog","surface_form":"Tyler's tree frog","offset":665}]}
