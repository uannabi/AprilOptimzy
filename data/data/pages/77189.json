{"id":77189,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A6M_Zero","text":"The Mitsubishi A6M Zero, often called just the A6M Zero or simply the Zero was a long range carrier ship-based fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. The aircraft was built by Mitsubishi, making its first flight in 1939, and entering naval service in 1940.\nIt was the primary fighter used by Japan during the war. It was the primary enemy of US Naval aircraft such as the Grumman F4F Wildcat, Vought F4U Corsair, and later the Grumman F6F Hellcat, which was specifically designed to combat the Zero. The A6M Zero was the best fighter at the beginning of the Pacific war. However, late in the war, new American fighters were able to defeat it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":111},{"uri":"Imperial_Japanese_Navy","surface_form":"Imperial Japanese Navy","offset":135},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":165},{"uri":"Mitsubishi","surface_form":"Mitsubishi","offset":205},{"uri":"Grumman_F4F_Wildcat","surface_form":"Grumman F4F Wildcat","offset":401},{"uri":"Vought_F4U_Corsair","surface_form":"Vought F4U Corsair","offset":422},{"uri":"Grumman_F6F_Hellcat","surface_form":"Grumman F6F Hellcat","offset":456}]}
