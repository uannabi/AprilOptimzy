{"id":77198,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Federation","text":"=\"preserve\">The Mali Federation was a country in the west of Africa. Senegal and Mali came together and made this country. (Mali's name was French Sudan at that time). It started on April 4 1959 and it was controlled by France. However, it became independent on June 20 1960.\nThe Federation's prime minister was Modibo Keita, and the government was in Dakar. The Federation ended a short time after independence because Senegal left on August 20 1960 because they had a disagreement about politics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":38},{"uri":"West","surface_form":"west","offset":53},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":61},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":69},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":81},{"uri":"Mali","surface_form":"Mali","offset":124},{"uri":"French_Sudan","surface_form":"French Sudan","offset":140},{"uri":"April_4","surface_form":"April 4","offset":182},{"uri":"1959","surface_form":"1959","offset":190},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":220},{"uri":"June_20","surface_form":"June 20","offset":262},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":270},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":293},{"uri":"Modibo_Keita","surface_form":"Modibo Keita","offset":312},{"uri":"Dakar","surface_form":"Dakar","offset":352},{"uri":"Senegal","surface_form":"Senegal","offset":420},{"uri":"August_20","surface_form":"August 20","offset":436},{"uri":"1960","surface_form":"1960","offset":446}]}
