{"id":772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin","text":"Skin is the outside covering of animals. The skin of different kinds of animals is very different. Many kinds of animals have hair or fur on their skin. Birds have feathers on their skin. Most fish, and reptiles, like snakes and lizards, have scales on their skin.\nThe skin of human beings usually has very small hairs on it that are hard to see. Some people have more hair, or hair that is easier to see, and some have less. People have hair that is longer and easier to see on some parts of their bodies, such as the tops of their heads and men's beards. The skin is actually the largest organ of the human body. Without our skin we would easily get infected with diseases and viruses. Keeping it clean is important to health.\nThe skin of cows can be made into leather. Leather is sometimes used to make shoes, bags, and balls.\nOther things can be said to have \"skins\". People often say that fruits, such as apples and bananas, and vegetables, such as potatoes, have \"skins\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Outside","surface_form":"outside","offset":12},{"uri":"Covering","surface_form":"covering","offset":20},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":32},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":126},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":134},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"Bird","offset":153},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":164},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":193},{"uri":"Reptile","surface_form":"reptile","offset":203},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":218},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":229},{"uri":"Scale_(zoology)","surface_form":"scales","offset":243},{"uri":"Human_being","surface_form":"human being","offset":277},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":313},{"uri":"Body","surface_form":"bodies","offset":499},{"uri":"Men","surface_form":"men","offset":543},{"uri":"Beard","surface_form":"beard","offset":549},{"uri":"Leather","surface_form":"leather","offset":763},{"uri":"Shoe","surface_form":"shoe","offset":806},{"uri":"Bag","surface_form":"bag","offset":813},{"uri":"Ball","surface_form":"ball","offset":823},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":894},{"uri":"Apple","surface_form":"apple","offset":910},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":921},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":934},{"uri":"Potato","surface_form":"potato","offset":954}]}
