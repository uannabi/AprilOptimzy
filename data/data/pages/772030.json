{"id":772030,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Amans","text":"Jacques Guillaume Lucien Amans (1801\u20131888) was a French neoclassical portrait painter working in New Orleans in the 1840s and 1850s.\nAmans was born in Maastricht. Maastricht was a French city at the time. His father, Paul Serge Amans, was born in Narbonne in 1765. He was a French officer (Capitaine-Adjudant de place de 1\u00E8re classe \u00E0 Maastricht) of Napol\u00E9on. Jacques Guillaume Lucien Amans was trained in the French neoclassical tradition of portraiture. He exhibited at the Paris Salon from 1831 to 1837. News of fellow-artist Jean Joseph Vaudechamp\u2019s good fortune in finding patrons probably led Amans to visit Louisiana since the two artists traveled on the same ship from France to New Orleans in about 1837. Following Vaudechamp\u2019s departure from Louisiana in 1839, Amans assumed the role as the most celebrated portraitist in Louisiana. In the mid-1840s he married Azoline Landreaux, the daughter of a St. Charles Parish sugar planter Pierre Honor\u00E9 Landreaux and Jos\u00E9phine Armant, and purchased Trinity Plantation on Bayou Lafourche. Amans and Azoline moved back to France in 1856 where he died in 1888, ch\u00E2teau de L\u00E9vis Saint Nom (78), never having returned to Louisiana.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neoclassicism","surface_form":"neoclassical","offset":56},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":97},{"uri":"Maastricht","surface_form":"Maastricht","offset":151},{"uri":"Narbonne","surface_form":"Narbonne","offset":247},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portraiture","offset":443},{"uri":"Paris_Salon","surface_form":"Paris Salon","offset":476},{"uri":"Jean_Joseph_Vaudechamp","surface_form":"Jean Joseph Vaudechamp","offset":529},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":614},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":687},{"uri":"St._Charles_Parish","surface_form":"St. Charles Parish","offset":908},{"uri":"Bayou_Lafourche","surface_form":"Bayou Lafourche","offset":1023}]}
