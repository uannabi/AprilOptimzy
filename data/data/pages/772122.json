In this case, vetting is the process of Biden's campaign looking for a running mate. The Biden campaign was reported to have begun the vetting process of potential running mates in May 2020. In July 2020, Biden said that \"I am not committed to naming any but the people I've named, and among them are four Black women\".\nAt first, Biden hoped to announce his running mate the week of August 5, 2020, however his campaign has pushed the announcement date to before the DNC Convention would start, which would be August 16 or before. \"The New York Times\" reported on August 10, that an announcement of who Biden picked as his running mate will happen either August 11 or August 12.\nHis running mate vetting process has been criticized for Biden's campaign alleged \"blatant disrespectful\" treatment towards black women and sexism.\nFinal candidates.\nOn June 26, 2020, CNN and \"The Washington Post\" reported that the following five individuals were the leading candidates for the nomination. On July 29, just a week before Biden's planned announcement, \"The Hill\" reported that Karen Bass, Harris, Rice, and Warren had emerged as the \"top tier\" of candidates. On August 2, CNN reported that Tammy Duckworth and Gretchen Whitmer were also still under consideration.\nOther individuals considered.\nThe following six individuals were originally cited to have begun undergoing vetting by the Biden campaign in May or June 2020, but it is uncertain whether they have moved on to further stages in subsequent months or not.\nFollowing the George Floyd protests, Amy Klobuchar was criticized for her lack of prosecution of police misconduct during her tenure, including a case involving the officer accused of murdering Floyd. On June 18, she announced that she had removed herself from consideration and urged for Biden to select a woman of color.\nDeclined to be considered.\nThe following individuals publicly confirmed that they had declined to be vetted by the Biden campaign.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":48},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President of the United States","offset":74},{"uri":"2020_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"2020 election","offset":117},{"uri":"Joe_Biden","surface_form":"Joe Biden","offset":154},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries%2C_2020","surface_form":"presumptive nominee","offset":169},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":193},{"uri":"2020_Democratic_National_Convention","surface_form":"2020 Democratic National Convention","offset":279},{"uri":"Geraldine_Ferraro","surface_form":"Geraldine Ferraro","offset":480},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_1984","surface_form":"1984","offset":499},{"uri":"Sarah_Palin","surface_form":"Sarah Palin","offset":509},{"uri":"United_States_presidential_election%2C_2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":522},{"uri":"U.S._Senator","surface_form":"U.S. Senator","offset":561},{"uri":"Kamala_Harris","surface_form":"Kamala Harris","offset":574},{"uri":"Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign","surface_form":"Biden's campaign","offset":755},{"uri":"Running_mate","surface_form":"running mate","offset":786},{"uri":"2020_Democratic_National_Convention","surface_form":"DNC Convention","offset":1182},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":1247},{"uri":"Sexism","surface_form":"sexism","offset":1534},{"uri":"CNN","surface_form":"CNN","offset":1578},{"uri":"The_Washington_Post","surface_form":"The Washington Post","offset":1587},{"uri":"The_Hill_(newspaper)","surface_form":"The Hill","offset":1763},{"uri":"Karen_Bass","surface_form":"Karen Bass","offset":1787},{"uri":"Tammy_Duckworth","surface_form":"Tammy Duckworth","offset":1900},{"uri":"Gretchen_Whitmer","surface_form":"Gretchen Whitmer","offset":1920},{"uri":"George_Floyd_protests","surface_form":"George Floyd protests","offset":2240},{"uri":"Amy_Klobuchar","surface_form":"Amy Klobuchar","offset":2263}]}
