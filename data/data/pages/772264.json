{"id":772264,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumter_County_Does","text":"The Sumter County Does, also known as Jock Doe and Jane Doe were two homicide victims \u2013 a man and a woman. They were killed on a small dirt road in a rural part of Sumter County, South Carolina on August 9, 1976. It is still not known who either of them are. They were both shot three times in the same way. Once in the throat, once in the chest, and once in the back. They were shot with a .357 caliber revolver.\nThe male victim was aged between 18 and 30. One dentist said he thought he could have been older than 27. His skin was an olive white colour and he had brown eyes and brown hair down to his shoulders. He was over tall and weighed around. He had a lot of work done to his teeth that was probably done outside the United States. He also had many scars on his back and shoulders, meaning he might have played contact sport. He was wearing faded Levi jeans and a red T-shirt. The shirt had the words \"Coors \u2014 America's Light Beer\" on the front and \"Camel Challenger GT Sebring '75\" on the back. It also had a Snoopy design. The shirt came from the Sebring Races being held at the time in Sebring, Florida, meaning he may have been there. He was wearing no underwear and had a pack of matches in his pocket from a \"Grant's Truck Stop\". This truck stop is thought to be in the Midwestern United States. He also had a ring on with the letters \"JPF\" written on the inside. This could mean his name began with a \"J\".\nThe female victim is thought to be younger than the male one, aged between 18 and 25 years old. She had reddish-brown hair down to her shoulders and blue or gray eyes. She had two moles on the left of her face. She had no scars and had never been pregnant. She also had not shaved her legs. She was wearing a white muslin blouse over a pink halter top. She also wore blue denim cut-off shorts. She had purple and pink Stride-Rite brand wedge-heeled sandals. Like the male victim, she was wearing no underwear.\nPictures, drawings and photographs of the pair were spread all around the U.S., but it is still unknown who they were. DNA testing found that they were not related to each other in 2007. Police have paused the investigation until it is known who the pair were.\nThey were buried in graves marked \"Male Unknown\" and \"Female Unknown\"at the Bethel United Methodist Church Cemetery in Oswego, South Carolina on August 14, 1977. This was around a year after they had died.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Homicide","surface_form":"homicide","offset":69},{"uri":"Man","surface_form":"man","offset":90},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":100},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":140},{"uri":"Rural","surface_form":"rural","offset":150},{"uri":"Sumter_County%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Sumter County","offset":164},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":179},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":320},{"uri":"Chest","surface_form":"chest","offset":340},{"uri":"Back","surface_form":"back","offset":363},{"uri":".357_Magnum","surface_form":".357 caliber","offset":391},{"uri":"Revolver","surface_form":"revolver","offset":404},{"uri":"Dentist","surface_form":"dentist","offset":462},{"uri":"Eyes","surface_form":"eyes","offset":572},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hair","offset":587},{"uri":"Scar","surface_form":"scar","offset":758},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":828},{"uri":"Levi_Strauss_%26amp%3B_Co.","surface_form":"Levi","offset":856},{"uri":"Jeans","surface_form":"jeans","offset":861},{"uri":"T-shirt","surface_form":"T-shirt","offset":877},{"uri":"Snoopy","surface_form":"Snoopy","offset":1019},{"uri":"Sebring_International_Raceway","surface_form":"Sebring Races","offset":1058},{"uri":"Sebring%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Sebring, Florida","offset":1098},{"uri":"Match","surface_form":"match","offset":1194},{"uri":"Truck_stop","surface_form":"truck stop","offset":1250},{"uri":"Midwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Midwestern United States","offset":1285},{"uri":"Ring","surface_form":"ring","offset":1325},{"uri":"Melanocytic_nevus","surface_form":"moles","offset":1602},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":1669},{"uri":"Muslin","surface_form":"muslin","offset":1737},{"uri":"Blouse","surface_form":"blouse","offset":1744},{"uri":"Halter_top","surface_form":"halter top","offset":1763},{"uri":"Denim","surface_form":"denim","offset":1794},{"uri":"Hot_pants","surface_form":"cut-off shorts","offset":1800},{"uri":"Stride_Rite_Corporation","surface_form":"Stride-Rite","offset":1840},{"uri":"Wedge_(footwear)","surface_form":"wedge-heeled sandals","offset":1858},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":1955},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":2051},{"uri":"Investigation","surface_form":"investigation","offset":2142},{"uri":"Oswego%2C_South_Carolina","surface_form":"Oswego, South Carolina","offset":2312}]}
