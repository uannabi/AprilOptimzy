{"id":772681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail","text":"The Appalachian National Scenic Trail, often called the Appalachian Trail or the A.T., is a hiking trail in the eastern United States. The trail goes between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail is about long. The exact length changes over time as parts are changed. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy says the Appalachian Trail is the longest hiking-only trail in the world. More than 2 million people hike on part of the trail at least once each year.\nThe idea of the Appalachian Trail started in 1921. The trail was completed in 1937 after more than ten years of work. Changes to the trail still happen every year. Thirty-one trail clubs and many partners help keep it usable. The National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy manage it. Most of the trail is in forest or wild lands. Some parts go through towns, roads and farms. It passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.\nThru-hikers attempt to hike the whole trail in one season. The number of thru-hikes per year has increased steadily. In 2017, 715 northbound and 133 southbound thru-hikes were reported. Many books, documentaries, websites, and fan organizations are dedicated to the hike. Some people hike from one end to the other, then turn around and thru-hike the trail the other way. This is known as a \"yo-yo\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hiking_trail","surface_form":"hiking trail","offset":92},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":120},{"uri":"Springer_Mountain","surface_form":"Springer Mountain","offset":158},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":179},{"uri":"Mount_Katahdin","surface_form":"Mount Katahdin","offset":191},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":209},{"uri":"Appalachian_Trail_Conservancy","surface_form":"Appalachian Trail Conservancy","offset":302},{"uri":"National_Park_Service","surface_form":"National Park Service","offset":714},{"uri":"United_States_Forest_Service","surface_form":"United States Forest Service","offset":737},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":947},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":956},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":972},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":983},{"uri":"West_Virginia","surface_form":"West Virginia","offset":993},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":1008},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":1018},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":1032},{"uri":"New_York_(state)","surface_form":"New York","offset":1044},{"uri":"Connecticut","surface_form":"Connecticut","offset":1054},{"uri":"Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts","offset":1067},{"uri":"Vermont","surface_form":"Vermont","offset":1082},{"uri":"New_Hampshire","surface_form":"New Hampshire","offset":1091},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":1110},{"uri":"Thru-hiking","surface_form":"Thru-hikers","offset":1117},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":1168}]}
