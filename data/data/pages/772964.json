Bush, the 46th Governor of Texas, was formally launched on June 14, 1999 as Governor Bush, the eldest son of former President George H.W. Bush announced his plans to seek the Republican Party nomination for the presidency of the United States in the 2000 presidential election.\nBush began the campaign as the front runner among Republicans because many people knew his name, high funds, and control of the governorship of Texas and polls starting in 1997 showed Bush leading every opponent by double digits.\nThe main challenger to Bush was Senator John McCain, who appealed to moderate Republicans.\nBush won the majority of the primaries and after the March 2000 Super Tuesday contests he was well ahead in delegates of both McCain and Alan Keyes. On August 3, 2000 Bush won the Republican nomination at the Republican Convention with the support of 2,058 delegates. Dick Cheney, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, was nominated as vice president despite Cheney recommending former Missouri Senator John Danforth.\nThroughout the majority of the primary and general campaign seasons Bush was leading Gore in the polls. On November 7, 2000, it was projected that Bush had won in Florida and its 25 electoral votes.\nGore won the national popular vote but the Gore campaign lost the electoral college vote after a legal battle over disputed vote counts. Bush won the election on the electoral college vote of 271 to 266.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
