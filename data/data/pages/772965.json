Along with his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden.\nBarack Obama ran in the general election against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, along with many minor candidates from other parties. The election took place on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.\nObama's campaign headquarters was in Chicago and key members of his successful campaign in 2008, such as Jim Messina and David Axelrod, returned to staff it.\nOn the day of the announcement, the campaign released a promotional video showing supporters of Obama organizing for the re-election effort. As \"The Guardian\" newspaper noted, this was the first U.S. presidential reelection campaign to use Facebook and Twitter for promotion.\nBetween early-2011 and June 30, 2012, the Obama campaign and supporters spent about $400 million, according to the Federal Election Commission. Obama won his reelection bid by a margin of 51.06 to 47.21%. This was the first time since 1944, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt won re-election, that a Democratic president had won by a majority of the electoral votes and over 51% of the popular vote twice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"44th","offset":50},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":55},{"uri":"Joe_Biden","surface_form":"Joe Biden","offset":172},{"uri":"Barack_Obama","surface_form":"Barack Obama","offset":183},{"uri":"Governor_of_Massachusetts","surface_form":"Massachusetts Governor","offset":239},{"uri":"Mitt_Romney","surface_form":"Mitt Romney","offset":262},{"uri":"List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"other parties","offset":313},{"uri":"2012_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"election","offset":332},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":419},{"uri":"Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign","surface_form":"his successful campaign in 2008","offset":446},{"uri":"Jim_Messina_(political_staffer)","surface_form":"Jim Messina","offset":487},{"uri":"David_Axelrod","surface_form":"David Axelrod","offset":503},{"uri":"The_Guardian","surface_form":"The Guardian","offset":685},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":780},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":793},{"uri":"Federal_Election_Commission","surface_form":"Federal Election Commission","offset":931},{"uri":"1944_United_States_presidential_election","surface_form":"1944","offset":1051},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
