{"id":77304,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammaliaformes","text":"Mammaliaformes (\"mammal-like\") is a clade which contains the mammals and their closest extinct relatives.\nLiving members of the clade include the monotremes (Monotremata), marsupials (Marsupialia) and the eutherians (Placentalia).\nMammaliforms have highly specialized molar teeth, with cusps and flat regions for grinding food. This is a single inherited system in present mammals, but it seems to have evolved convergently in pre-mammals more than once. Instead of having many teeth that are frequently replaced, mammals have one set of baby teeth and later one set of adult teeth which fit together precisely. This may help to grind food, and make it easier to digest.\nLactation (milk) and fur, along with other features, also characterize the Mammaliaformes, though these traits are difficult to study in the fossil record. The fossilized remains of \"Castorocauda lutrasimilis\" are an exception to this.\nEvolution of early mammals.\nFossils of Mesozoic proto-mammals were very scarce. There were only 116 in 1979, but this has changed in recent times. There were about 310 in 2007, with an increase in quality so that there are \"at least 18 Mesozoic mammals [with] nearly complete skeletons\".\nEcological niches in the Mesozoic.\nThis paints a picture of small-sized mammals being already quite successful and diversified in the Jurassic and early Cretaceous.\nTaxonomy.\nIn some sources Class Mammalia takes the place of Mammaliaformes, and includes all members of that clade.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":36},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":61},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"extinct","offset":87},{"uri":"Monotremata","surface_form":"Monotremata","offset":158},{"uri":"Marsupialia","surface_form":"Marsupialia","offset":184},{"uri":"Placentalia","surface_form":"Placentalia","offset":217},{"uri":"Molar","surface_form":"molar","offset":268},{"uri":"Cusp","surface_form":"cusp","offset":286},{"uri":"Convergent_evolution","surface_form":"evolved convergently","offset":403},{"uri":"Lactation","surface_form":"Lactation","offset":671},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":692},{"uri":"Castorocauda","surface_form":"Castorocauda","offset":854},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":946}]}
