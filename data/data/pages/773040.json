{"id":773040,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilab","text":"Scilab is an open source MATLAB-like programming language for numerical analysis. It is used in many countries including non-English regions.\nSyntax.\nScilab syntax is largely based on the MATLAB language. The simplest way to use Scilab codes is to type it in at the prompt, codice_2, in the graphical command window.\nToolboxes.\nScilab has many toolboxes for different tasks, such as\nMore are available on ATOMS Portal or the Scilab forge.\nDifferences between GNU Octave.\nGNU Octave is also a MATLAB-like language. But it was made by different technical viewpoints.\nUsage.\nThe original purpose of Scilab was numerical analysis (such as numerical methods for ordinary differential equations). Today, it is also used in scientific education and optimization.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"MATLAB","surface_form":"MATLAB","offset":25},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":37},{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical analysis","offset":62},{"uri":"Syntax","surface_form":"syntax","offset":157},{"uri":"MATLAB","surface_form":"MATLAB","offset":188},{"uri":"Command-line_interface","surface_form":"prompt","offset":266},{"uri":"GNU_Octave","surface_form":"GNU Octave","offset":471},{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical analysis","offset":607},{"uri":"Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations","surface_form":"numerical methods for ordinary differential equations","offset":635},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"education","offset":728},{"uri":"Optimization","surface_form":"optimization","offset":742}]}
