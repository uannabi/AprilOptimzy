{"id":773209,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kay_Letourneau","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mary Katherine Schmitz (formerly Letourneau; January 30, 1962 \u2013 July 6, 2020) was an American schoolteacher. She pleaded guilty in 1997 to two counts of felony second-degree rape of a child. The victim was Vili Fualaau, who was 12 or 13 at the time and had been her sixth-grade student. She was born in Tustin, California.\nWhile awaiting sentencing, she gave birth to Fualaau's child. With the state seeking a six-and-a-half year prison sentence, she reached a plea agreement calling for six months in jail, with three months suspended, and no contact with Fualaau for life among other terms.\nShortly after spending three months in jail, the police caught Letourneau in a car with Fualaau. She was later given a prison sentence for the maximum allowed by law of seven-and-a-half years. Eight months after returning to prison, she gave birth to Fualaau's second child, another daughter. She was imprisoned from 1998 to 2004.\nLetourneau and Fualaau began a 14-year marriage in May 2005. They divorced in 2019.\nLetourneau died of colon cancer on July 6, 2020 at the age of 58.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":187},{"uri":"Tustin%2C_California","surface_form":"Tustin, California","offset":316},{"uri":"Plea_agreement","surface_form":"plea agreement","offset":474},{"uri":"Colon_cancer","surface_form":"colon cancer","offset":1040}]}
