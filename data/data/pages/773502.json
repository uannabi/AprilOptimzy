{"id":773502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Pennsylvania","text":"The Lieutenant Governor is a constitutional officer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The lieutenant governor is elected for a four-year term in the same year as the governor. Each party picks a candidate for lieutenant governor independently of the gubernatorial primary. The winners of the party primaries are then teamed together as a single ticket for the fall general election.\nThe lieutenant governor is in charge of the Senate and is first in the line of succession to the governor; in the event the governor dies, resigns, or otherwise leaves office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Commonwealth of Pennsylvania","offset":59},{"uri":"Governor_of_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"governor","offset":169}]}
