He is believed to have threatened both victims and police.\nDuring the decades-long investigation, several suspects were cleared through DNA evidence, alibi, or other investigative methods.\nIn 2001, after DNA testing indicated that the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker were the same person, the name EARONS started to be used. He was nicknamed Golden State Killer in early 2013 to raise awareness that he was not caught.\nCapture.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local law-enforcement agencies held a news conference on June 15, 2016, to announce a renewed nationwide effort. On April 24, 2018, authorities charged 72-year-old DeAngelo with eight counts of first-degree murder, based upon DNA evidence; investigators had identified members of DeAngelo's family through forensic genetic genealogy.\nVerdict.\nDeAngelo cannot be charged with 1970s rapes, but he was charged in August 2018 with 13 related kidnapping and kidnapping attempts.
