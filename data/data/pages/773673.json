Scientists saw it on Hides Ridge in the Southern Fold Mountains in Papua New Guinea. Like the Pinocchio frog, it has a point on its nose that can grow or shrink.\nThe male adult frog is about 2.9 cm long. It is light yellow-brown in color with light green patches and more yellow on its legs. It has a spike on its nose, and all of its toes are webbed.\nAs of 2019, scientists only saw \"Litoria vivissimia\" once, in Central Cordillera. The scientists used DNA barcoding to examine \"Litoria vivissimia\" and its relatives the parachuting frog and the Pinocchio frog.\nThe Latin name of this frog \"vivissimia\" means \"cheeky monkey\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":55},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":79},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":158},{"uri":"Pinocchio_frog","surface_form":"Pinocchio frog","offset":185},{"uri":"DNA_barcoding","surface_form":"DNA barcoding","offset":545},{"uri":"Parachuting_frog","surface_form":"parachuting frog","offset":613}]}
