{"id":773763,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming","text":"e=\"preserve\">Deadnaming is using a name (called a \"deadname\") that a transgender person used before transitioning without their permission. It is called that because the person who that name belongs to is considered \"dead\" and is now a brand-new person.\nSometimes, people deadname another person by accident. They may know the other person before they transitioned. Other times, people deadname other people on purpose. Using a person's deadname is considered to be very disrespectful because it ignores a person's gender identity and is a type of transphobia if it happens on purpose. Some people think that deadnaming is a form of violence.\nObstacles.\nIt is very hard for people to change their names on forms because there is a lot of paperwork involved. That means that they are more likely to experience deadnaming.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"transgender","offset":69},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"dead","offset":217},{"uri":"Disrespectful","surface_form":"disrespectful","offset":471},{"uri":"Gender_identity","surface_form":"gender identity","offset":515},{"uri":"Transphobia","surface_form":"transphobia","offset":548},{"uri":"Violence","surface_form":"violence","offset":633}]}
