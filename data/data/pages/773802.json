This was the subject of Moler's thesis.\nWho is Cleve Moler?\nCleve Moler is a famous mathematician. He is known for his scientific textbooks and technical reviews.\nNotable products.\nMathWorks is known for making powerful software used in many scientific and technical fields.\nMATLAB.\nMATLAB is a programming language made for numerical analysis (especially numerical linear algebra). It is named after Matrix Laboratory.\nSimulation software.\nMathWorks is also known for their simulation-related products. The most famous one is Simulink. It is very popular as same as MATLAB. There is also SimEvents and Stateflow. SimEvents was made to simulate physical or dynamical events. On the other hand, Stateflow aims to understand the state (status) of fluid/atmospheric or any other kind of flows.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Company","surface_form":"company","offset":39},{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":75},{"uri":"Wave_equation","surface_form":"wave equation","offset":161},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":260},{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical analysis","offset":501},{"uri":"Numerical_linear_algebra","surface_form":"numerical linear algebra","offset":532},{"uri":"Matrix_(mathematics)","surface_form":"Matrix","offset":577},{"uri":"Simulation","surface_form":"simulation","offset":651},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"events","offset":843},{"uri":"Status","surface_form":"status","offset":910},{"uri":"Flow","surface_form":"flow","offset":960}]}
