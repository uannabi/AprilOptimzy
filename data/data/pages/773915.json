{"id":773915,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyctimystes","text":"\"Nyctimystes\" is a genus of tree frogs in the family Pelodryadidae. Most of them are from Papua New Guinea but some live on the Moluccas islands. Some scientists think \"Nyctimystes\" should be considered part of \"Litoria\", another genus of frogs from New Guinea. Other scientists think that it is right to say \"Nyctimystes\" is its own genus.\nAll frogs in \"Nyctimystes\" have marks on their lower eyelids: lines, veins, or dots. Scientists think this helps the frog harder to see so it can hide from larger animals that want to eat it. Scientists tell \"Nyctimystes\" frogs apart from \"Litoria\" frogs because \"Nyctimystes\" frogs have vertical (up and down) pupils in their eyes and \"Litoria\" frogs have horizontal (side to side) pupils in their eyes.\nThese frogs live in tropical or subtropical rainforests on mountains. Their eggs are large and scientists have seen many of them laying eggs on underwater objects in fast-flowing creeks and streams, enough that they think all \"Nyctimystes\" frogs do this. The tadpoles have large sucker-mouths and streamlined bodies with large, muscular tails. All \"Nyctimystes frogs\" have webbed feet and large discs on their toes for climbing.\nScientists say most \"Nyctimystes\" frogs became separate species during the Miocene era, about 10 to 22 million years ago.\nThe name comes from the Greek \"nycktos\" for \"night\" and \"myst\" meaning \"mist.\" Together they refer to \"mysteries of the night.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":19},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":33},{"uri":"Pelodryadidae","surface_form":"Pelodryadidae","offset":53},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":90},{"uri":"Moluccas","surface_form":"Moluccas","offset":128},{"uri":"Litoria","surface_form":"Litoria","offset":212},{"uri":"Camouflage","surface_form":"harder to see","offset":463},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":766},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":778},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":790},{"uri":"Miocene","surface_form":"Miocene","offset":1250},{"uri":"Greek_(language)","surface_form":"Greek","offset":1321}]}
