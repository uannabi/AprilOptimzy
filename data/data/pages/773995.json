{"id":773995,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Australia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Australia has no official language, but the national language of Australia is English. There are also many languages spoken by Indigenous Australians and by different ethnic groups.\nEnglish.\nThe English language was spoken by the British colonists who came to Australia in the 18th and the 19th centuries. It was used in the colonies they started. Most people who live in Australia today speak English. In 2016, 72.7 percent of people living in Australia only spoke English at home. A dialect of English is spoken in Australia, called Australian English.\nIndigenous languages.\nIndigenous Australians have been living in Australia for at least 50,000 years. There are around 290 to 363 Indigenous languages. They are from around 28 language families and language isolates. Many of these languages are not spoken any more or by many people because of the use of English. The largest language family is the Pama-Nyungan family, which has 248 languages.\nThree Indigenous languages are spoken in the Torres Strait Islands. These languages are Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Meriam Mir and Yumplatok, a creole of Pacific English. Yumplatok is spoken on the islands more than the other languages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":13},{"uri":"Official_language","surface_form":"official language","offset":30},{"uri":"National_language","surface_form":"national language","offset":57},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":91},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Indigenous Australians","offset":140},{"uri":"Ethnic_groups","surface_form":"ethnic groups","offset":180},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":208},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":243},{"uri":"Colonization","surface_form":"colonists","offset":251},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":338},{"uri":"Dialects_of_English","surface_form":"dialect of English","offset":498},{"uri":"Australian_English","surface_form":"Australian English","offset":548},{"uri":"Indigenous_Australians","surface_form":"Indigenous Australians","offset":590},{"uri":"Language_family","surface_form":"language families","offset":744},{"uri":"Language_isolate","surface_form":"language isolates","offset":766},{"uri":"Pama-Nyungan_languages","surface_form":"Pama-Nyungan","offset":917},{"uri":"Torres_Strait_Islands","surface_form":"Torres Strait Islands","offset":1008},{"uri":"Kalaw_Lagaw_Ya","surface_form":"Kalaw Lagaw Ya","offset":1051},{"uri":"Meriam_Mir","surface_form":"Meriam Mir","offset":1067},{"uri":"Yumplatok","surface_form":"Yumplatok","offset":1082},{"uri":"Creole_language","surface_form":"creole","offset":1095}]}
