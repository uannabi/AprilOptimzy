It was unofficially known as the club's first women's team. They helped start the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989. The team played better and better in the 90s at different levels of the FA Women's National League, until 2001.\n2001\u20132005: Partnership and disbandment.\nIn 2001, the team started an official partnership with Manchester United. However, the club finished mid-table in the third division for a few years. The team stopped playing four years later, in 2005. This was soon after Malcolm Glazer's bought the club. He did not believe the women's team was going to make him any money. A media spokesman for Manchester United also said that the club wanted to focus on its women's academy instead of its senior team.\n2018\u2013present: Current team.\nIn March 2018, Manchester United announced they wanted to start a new women's football team. Manchester United Women Football Club started again on 28 May 2018. This was after the team asked to join the new 2018\u201319 FA Women's Championship. This was thirteen years after the club stopped playing in 2005. The club's academy had continued through the Manchester United Foundation. For example, Izzy Christiansen and Katie Zelem went through United's Centre of Excellence academy. Casey Stoney was the club's first head coach. She became coach on 8 June.

On 17 April 2019, United won promotion to the FA Women's Super League after a 5\u20130 win against the same team. They won the FA Women's Championship title three days later. This was after a 7\u20130 win at home to Crystal Palace. In May 2019, Manchester United were named FA Women's Championship Club of the Year at the 2019 FA Women\u2019s Football Awards.\nThe 2019\u201320 season was the team's first FA WSL campaign.

United played an FA Cup fifth round match there against London Bees in February 2019.\nReserves and academy.\nManchester United had a girls academy up to under 16's level even when the senior team did not play between 2005 and 2018.
