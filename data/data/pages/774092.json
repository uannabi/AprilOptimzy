The teaching staff consists of both French and Azerbaijani professors. Upon graduation, UFAZ graduates receive Azerbaijani (ASOIU) and French (University of Strasbourg or University of Rennes 1) national diplomas.\nAt present, the UFAZ counts 4 specialties at the bachelor level: chemical engineering, geophysical engineering, computer science, and oil and gas engineering.\nMost UFAZ students, more than 80%, are scholarship holders who receive free education based on Azerbaijani government's financial support.\nUFAZ will open new master's programs for the 2020/2021 academic year in the following areas: chemical engineering / physical chemistry, geosciences and applied computer sciences (big data and artificial intelligence).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2016","surface_form":"2016","offset":58},{"uri":"Initiative","surface_form":"initiative","offset":70},{"uri":"President_of_Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijani President","offset":84},{"uri":"Ilham_Aliyev","surface_form":"Ilham Aliyev","offset":106},{"uri":"President_of_France","surface_form":"French President","offset":123},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_Hollande","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois Hollande","offset":140},{"uri":"Joint","surface_form":"joint","offset":163},{"uri":"Project","surface_form":"project","offset":169},{"uri":"University_of_Strasbourg","surface_form":"University of Strasbourg","offset":188},{"uri":"Azerbaijan_State_Oil_and_Industry_University","surface_form":"Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University","offset":221},{"uri":"Campus","surface_form":"campus","offset":284},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":373},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":385},{"uri":"Baku","surface_form":"Baku","offset":398},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professor","offset":421},{"uri":"Teaching","surface_form":"Teaching","offset":495},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":522},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":548},{"uri":"Curriculum","surface_form":"curriculum","offset":557},{"uri":"University_of_Strasbourg","surface_form":"University of Strasbourg","offset":595},{"uri":"University_of_Rennes_1","surface_form":"University of Rennes 1","offset":629},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor","offset":680},{"uri":"Undergraduate","surface_form":"undergraduate","offset":722},{"uri":"Course","surface_form":"course","offset":736},{"uri":"Professor","surface_form":"professors","offset":905},{"uri":"Diploma","surface_form":"diplomas","offset":1050},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor","offset":1109},{"uri":"Chemical_engineering","surface_form":"chemical engineering","offset":1125},{"uri":"Geoprofessions","surface_form":"geophysical engineering","offset":1147},{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":1172},{"uri":"Petroleum_engineering","surface_form":"oil and gas engineering","offset":1194},{"uri":"Scholarship","surface_form":"scholarship","offset":1258},{"uri":"Free_education","surface_form":"free education","offset":1290},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":1326},{"uri":"Master%27s_degree","surface_form":"master","offset":1377},{"uri":"Chemical_engineering","surface_form":"chemical engineering","offset":1451},{"uri":"Physical_chemistry","surface_form":"physical chemistry","offset":1474},{"uri":"Geosciences","surface_form":"geosciences","offset":1494},{"uri":"Big_data","surface_form":"big data","offset":1537},{"uri":"Artificial_intelligence","surface_form":"artificial intelligence","offset":1550}]}
