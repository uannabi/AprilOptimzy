It was an important town in those years but later it lost its importance. In the 18th century, the Spanish government moved the city to its present place, away from the river, and brought families from the Canary Islands to live there.\nWhen the Haitian independence, most of the people moved to other places. When the Haitians occupied the eastern part of the island (the present Dominican Republic), they founded again the town as part of the Artibonite department.\nAfter the Dominican Independence in 1844, the town was made a municipality of the Azua province. But again the town was abandoned by its inhabitants. After the \"Restoration War\" (1863 - 1865), some families from other towns near the Haitian border came to live in B\u00E1nica.\nB\u00E1nica was made a municipality of the San Juan province in 1938 and then, in 1942, of the new province of El\u00EDas Pi\u00F1a.\nGeography.\nB\u00E1nica is at to the west of Santo Domingo and to the northeast of Comendador.\nThe limits of the municipality are the municipality of Pedro Santana to the north, the San Juan province to the east, the municipality of Comendador to the south and Haiti to the west.\nThe average daily temperature in the city is 25.4\u00A0\u00B0C.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activity of the municipality is farming.
