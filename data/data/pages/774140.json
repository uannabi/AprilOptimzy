The goal was to improve the stability of those currencies. As of 2020, three currencies participate in ERM II: the Danish krone, the Croatian kuna and the Bulgarian lev.\nExchange rate by countries.\nSources: \"[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/convergence_reports_en.htm EC convergence reports 1996-2014], [https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/pubsto/quaristo/qrs10/Q10_Garofalo.pdf Italian lira], [http://www.hec.unil.ch/pbacchetta/Printed%20papers/WE97.pdf Spanish peseta], [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/wp9775.pdf Portuguese escudo], [http://www2.wu-wien.ac.at/ecsa//emu/papgenberg.pdf Finish markka], [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/wp9775.pdf Greek drachma], [https://libcom.org/library/britain-european-exchange-rate-mechanism UK pound]\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"European_Economic_Community","surface_form":"European Economic Community","offset":112},{"uri":"Eurozone","surface_form":"eurozone","offset":256},{"uri":"Danish_krone","surface_form":"Danish krone","offset":441},{"uri":"Croatian_kuna","surface_form":"Croatian kuna","offset":459},{"uri":"Bulgarian_lev","surface_form":"Bulgarian lev","offset":481}]}
