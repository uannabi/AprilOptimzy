{"id":774203,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)","text":"R is a programming language and free software environment for statistics. R is a language built for a specific purpose. It is strictly designed for statistical analysis. The algorithms for many statistical models are devised in R. Precisely R is the language of Statistical Analyzers. It\u2019s an open source and the best suite for the statisticians to develop statistical softwares. R is putting utmost efforts to walk parallelly to Python.\nUsage in other areas.\nThe R language was originally made for statistics. But today, it is also used in many scientific fields including ecology.\nDevelopment history.\nA list of changes in R releases is maintained in various \"news\" files at CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Some highlights are listed below for several major releases.\nCommunities.\nR has local communities worldwide for users to share ideas and learn.\nThere are a growing number of R events bringing its users together, such as conferences (e.g. useR!, WhyR?, conectaR, SatRdays) and other meetups.\n\"The R Journal\".\n\"The R Journal\" is the open access refereed journal of the R project. It features articles on the use and development of the R language.\nBasic syntax.\nThe following examples illustrate the basic syntax of the language and use of the command-line interface.\nIn R, the generally preferred assignment operator is an arrow made from two characters codice_2. Although codice_2 can be used instead.\n> x <- 1:6 # Create vector.\n> y <- x^2 # Create vector by formula.\n> print(y) # Print the vector\u2019s contents.\n[1] 1 4 9 16 25 36\n> mean(y) # Arithmetic mean of vector.\n> var(y) # Sample variance of vector.\n> model <- lm(y ~ x) # Linear regression model y = A + B * x.\n> print(model) # Print the model\u2019s results.\n> summary(model) # Display an in-depth summary of the model.\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n3.3333 -0.6667 -2.6667 -2.6667 -0.6667 3.3333\nEstimate Std.
