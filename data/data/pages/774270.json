{"id":774270,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Resistance_Army_insurgency","text":"The Lord's Resistance Army insurgency is a current guerrilla movement. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency started in 1987. As of 2020, the LRA is somewhat active in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Joseph Kony leads the movement. He says he is \"spokesperson\" of God and a spirit medium. The movement does not want Yoweri Museveni and his government in Uganda. They want to start a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and Acholi tradition.\nThe conflict is one of the longest in Africa. It has started a humanitarian crisis. The International Criminal Court says that the LRA has violated human rights. This includes mutilation, torture, slavery, rape, the abduction (kidnapping) of civilians, the use of child soldiers, and a number of massacres. By 2004, the LRA had abducted more than 20,000 children. 1.5 million civilians had to move. The LRA killed about 100,000 civilians.\nBackground.\nIn January 1986, the National Resistance Army (NRA) of south-west Uganda born Yoweri Museveni overthrew President Tito Okello, an ethnic Acholi. This started a period of unrest. When they tried to liberate the whole country, the NRA were responsible of many atrocities on the people of Acholi. This made some Acholis want to fight against these acts. Reports sometimes say that the Acholi were afraid to lose their traditional (usual) control of the national military. They were also very worried that the NRA would want retribution for the violent counterinsurgency, especially the actions of the army in the Luwero triangle. By August 1986, a complete popular insurgency had started in northern regions that the new government soldiers occupied.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Guerrilla","surface_form":"guerrilla","offset":51},{"uri":"Lord%27s_Resistance_Army","surface_form":"Lord's Resistance Army","offset":75},{"uri":"Insurgency","surface_form":"insurgency","offset":104},{"uri":"Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","surface_form":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","offset":182},{"uri":"Central_African_Republic","surface_form":"Central African Republic","offset":223},{"uri":"Joseph_Kony","surface_form":"Joseph Kony","offset":249},{"uri":"Spokesperson","surface_form":"spokesperson","offset":296},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":313},{"uri":"Spirit_medium","surface_form":"spirit medium","offset":323},{"uri":"Yoweri_Museveni","surface_form":"Yoweri Museveni","offset":365},{"uri":"Uganda","surface_form":"Uganda","offset":403},{"uri":"Theocratic","surface_form":"theocratic","offset":432},{"uri":"Ten_Commandments","surface_form":"Ten Commandments","offset":462},{"uri":"Acholi_people","surface_form":"Acholi","offset":483},{"uri":"Conflict","surface_form":"conflict","offset":505},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":539},{"uri":"Humanitarian_crisis","surface_form":"humanitarian crisis","offset":564},{"uri":"International_Criminal_Court","surface_form":"International Criminal Court","offset":589},{"uri":"Human_rights_violations","surface_form":"violated human rights","offset":640},{"uri":"Mutilation","surface_form":"mutilation","offset":677},{"uri":"Torture","surface_form":"torture","offset":689},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slavery","offset":698},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":707},{"uri":"Abduction","surface_form":"abduction","offset":717},{"uri":"Civilian","surface_form":"civilians","offset":743},{"uri":"Child_soldiers","surface_form":"child soldiers","offset":765},{"uri":"Massacre","surface_form":"massacres","offset":797},{"uri":"National_Resistance_Army","surface_form":"National Resistance Army","offset":973},{"uri":"Yoweri_Museveni","surface_form":"Yoweri Museveni","offset":1030},{"uri":"Overthrow","surface_form":"overthrew","offset":1046},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":1056},{"uri":"Tito_Okello","surface_form":"Tito Okello","offset":1066},{"uri":"Unrest","surface_form":"unrest","offset":1122},{"uri":"Liberation","surface_form":"liberate","offset":1149},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":1411},{"uri":"Retribution","surface_form":"retribution","offset":1473},{"uri":"Counterinsurgency","surface_form":"counterinsurgency","offset":1501},{"uri":"Luwero_triangle","surface_form":"Luwero triangle","offset":1562},{"uri":"Occupation","surface_form":"occupied","offset":1690}]}
