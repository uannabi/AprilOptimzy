{"id":774281,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_Perdition","text":"\"Road to Perdition\" is a 2002 American crime drama movie directed by Sam Mendes. The screenplay was adapted by David Self from the graphic novel of the same name written by Max Allan Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. It stars Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Daniel Craig. The story takes place in 1931, during the Great Depression, following a mob enforcer and his son as they seek vengeance against a mobster who murdered the rest of their family.\nFilming took place in the Chicago area. Mendes, having recently finished 1999's acclaimed \"American Beauty\", pursued a story that had minimal dialogue and conveyed emotion in the imagery. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall took advantage of the environment to create symbolism for the movie, for which he won several awards, including a posthumous Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The movie explores several themes, including the consequence of violence and father-son relationships.\nThe movie was released on July 12, 2002, and grossed over $180 million worldwide. The cinematography, setting, and the lead performances by Hanks and Newman were well received by critics. It was released on home media on February 25, 2003.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sam_Mendes","surface_form":"Sam Mendes","offset":69},{"uri":"Screenplay","surface_form":"screenplay","offset":85},{"uri":"David_Self","surface_form":"David Self","offset":111},{"uri":"Max_Allan_Collins","surface_form":"Max Allan Collins","offset":173},{"uri":"Richard_Piers_Rayner","surface_form":"Richard Piers Rayner","offset":210},{"uri":"Tom_Hanks","surface_form":"Tom Hanks","offset":241},{"uri":"Paul_Newman","surface_form":"Paul Newman","offset":252},{"uri":"Jude_Law","surface_form":"Jude Law","offset":265},{"uri":"Daniel_Craig","surface_form":"Daniel Craig","offset":279},{"uri":"Great_Depression","surface_form":"Great Depression","offset":335},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":496},{"uri":"American_Beauty_(movie)","surface_form":"American Beauty","offset":561},{"uri":"Conrad_L._Hall","surface_form":"Conrad L.
