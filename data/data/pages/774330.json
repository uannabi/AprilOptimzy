Scientists saw it on Mount Hagen in the Wahgi Valley region more than 2400 meters (8000 feet) above sea level.\nThe female frog is 6.4 cm long. It has side-to-side marks on its lower eyelid. The skin of the dead, preserved frog is darker brown on the back and lighter brown on the belly. It has much less webbing on its toes than other frogs in \"Nyctimystes\".\nIn the local Kaironk language, this frog is called \"mabas\", but other frogs are called by this name too.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":81},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":96},{"uri":"Nyctimystes","surface_form":"Nyctimystes","offset":459}]}
