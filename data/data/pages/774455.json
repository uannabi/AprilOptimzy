{"id":774455,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_seat","text":"Toilet seats let the user sit on a toilet by covering the bowl. Household toilet seats consist of a seat, cover and hinges. The place where you sit is called the seat. There is a hole in the middle of the seat so that you can defecate or urinate. Many toilet seats have a lid which keeps objects from falling into the bowl. Two metal hinges attach the seat to the toilet.\nCommon materials for the seat's body include plastic, wood and a special kind of ceramic called porcelain. Some homemakers prefer seats that are upholstered. This can means that the seat is covered in fabric.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Toilet","surface_form":"toilet","offset":35}]}
