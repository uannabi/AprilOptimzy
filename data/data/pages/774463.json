It was the successor to the 350 GT. In fact, it was based off the 350 GT, but had a larger V12 engine. There were two Lamborghinis known as the 400 GT: the standard 400 GT, and the one-off (one was built) 400 GT Monza.\nHistory.\nThe first 400 GT, commonly referred to as simply the 400 GT or 400 GT Interim, was basically the older 350 GT, but it had an enlarged, 3,929\u00A0cc V12 engine. The new engine had a power output of. Twenty-three of 400 GT Interims were built, three of which had aluminium bodywork.\nThe second 400 GT, commonly known as the 400 GT 2+2, had a different roofline, and small exterior changes compared to the 350 GT and 400 GT Interim. It was first presented at the 1966 Geneva Auto Show. The larger body shape allowed two seats to be installed in the rear, which the 350 GT didn\u2019t have. The bodywork for the 400 GT was designed by Carrozzeria Touring. The 400 GT also had a Lamborghini designed gearbox, which greatly improved the drivetrain.\nA total of 23 units of the 400 GT Interim and 224 units of the 400 GT 2+2 were built from 1966 to 1968, when it was replaced with the Islero.\nEngine and transmission.\nThe 400 GT was very similar to the 350 GT mechanically. However, it had a larger V12 engine, and a different five-speed manual transmission made by Lamborghini.\nPerformance.\nThe 400 GT was able to accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour (0-97 kilometres per hour) in 6.0 seconds. It could also accelerate from 0-100 miles per hour (0-161 kilometres per hour) in 13.1 seconds. The 400 GT\u2019s quarter mile time was 14.1 seconds, and it was going 103 miles per hour (166 kilometres per hour) at the end of the quarter mile.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grand_tourer","surface_form":"grand tourer","offset":28},{"uri":"Lamborghini","surface_form":"Lamborghini","offset":53},{"uri":"Successor","surface_form":"successor","offset":109},{"uri":"Lamborghini_350_GT","surface_form":"350 GT","offset":126},{"uri":"V12","surface_form":"V12","offset":189},{"uri":"Lamborghini_350_GT","surface_form":"350 GT","offset":429},{"uri":"V12_engine","surface_form":"V12 engine","offset":470},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":583},{"uri":"Exterior","surface_form":"exterior","offset":692},{"uri":"Carrozzeria_Touring","surface_form":"Carrozzeria Touring","offset":948},{"uri":"Transmission_(mechanics)","surface_form":"gearbox","offset":1012},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Islero","surface_form":"Islero","offset":1194},{"uri":"Mechanical","surface_form":"mechanical","offset":1269},{"uri":"Manual_transmission","surface_form":"manual transmission","offset":1347},{"uri":"Accelerate","surface_form":"accelerate","offset":1424},{"uri":"Miles_per_hour","surface_form":"miles per hour","offset":1445},{"uri":"Kilometres_per_hour","surface_form":"kilometres per hour","offset":1466},{"uri":"Quarter_mile","surface_form":"quarter mile","offset":1612}]}
