Scientists saw it on Mount Dayman and Mount Simpson between 1370 and 1400 meters above sea level. It lives in forests and wetlands not near the ocean.\nThis frog is 3.7 to 5.0 cm long. When alive, this frog is light brown with green or brown patches or olive gray with dark brown patches. Preserved, dead frogs are dark purple-gray, but the preservative may have made it darker than a living frog. This frog has teeth in its upper jaw.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":61},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":76}]}
