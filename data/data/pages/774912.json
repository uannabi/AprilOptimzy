He was the victim of a neo-Nazi attack in 1996. He lived in Birmingham, England. At the time he was attacked he was one of the many British and Irish construction workers working in Germany.\nOn 16 June 1996 in Brandenburg, in the former East Germany, he was attacked because of his dark skin by neo-Nazis. A block of concrete was thrown through the windshield of his car and Martin's car struck a tree.\nMartin became a quadriplegic as a result of the attack, and required 24-hour care. He was a supporter of assisted suicide. He traveled to Berlin, as a result so that he can be euthanized. His first announcement, in 2006, set 23 June 2007 as the date of his suicide. However, his assisted suicide has been delayed many times afterwards.\nMartin died on July 14, 2020, at the age of 60.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neo-Nazi","surface_form":"neo-Nazi","offset":104},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":141},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":225},{"uri":"Brandenburg","surface_form":"Brandenburg","offset":291},{"uri":"East_Germany","surface_form":"East Germany","offset":318},{"uri":"Quadriplegic","surface_form":"quadriplegic","offset":500},{"uri":"Assisted_suicide","surface_form":"assisted suicide","offset":589},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":622},{"uri":"Euthanized","surface_form":"euthanized","offset":660}]}
