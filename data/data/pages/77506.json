{"id":77506,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Six","text":"e=\"preserve\">Les Six (pronounced \"Le sees\") is French for \"The Six\". Les Six were a group of six French composers who were friends around the year 1920. They were young at the time, and they shared a lot of ideas about music. The composer Erik Satie called them \"Les Nouveaux Jeunes\", but then a man called Henri Collet called them \"Les Six\" in an article he was writing, and that name was always used for them after that.\nIn their music they tried to be different from Richard Wagner and other composers of Romantic music, and different from Debussy and Ravel who had been writing Impressionistic music. They also wanted to write in a simple way instead of using complicated rhythms such as those of Stravinsky or twelve tone music like Arnold Schoenberg. Many of their pieces were quite short. They liked strong, masculine music, especially jazz.\nThe six composers did not stay together for very long as they soon developed their own personal styles in their compositions.\nAfter 1920.\nIt was really only in 1920 that all six composers were together. They had all been inspired by Jean Cocteau and Eric Satie. By 1921 Louis Durey had already left the group. Les Six continued to be associated with the style of French music from around the 1920s. They still remained friends, and used to visit a bar known as \"La Gaya\" which became \"Le Boeuf sur le Toit\" (The Ox on the Roof): the title of Milhaud's ballet. The group published an album of piano pieces together called \"Album des Six\". Five of the members worked together on the music for Cocteau's work \"Les Mari\u00E9s de la Tour Eiffel\"\nThe name \"The Six\" was a reference to the group of Russian composers who had been known as \"The Five\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":47},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":97},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":104},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":147},{"uri":"Eric_Satie","surface_form":"Erik Satie","offset":239},{"uri":"Article","surface_form":"article","offset":348},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":470},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"Romantic music","offset":508},{"uri":"Debussy","surface_form":"Debussy","offset":543},{"uri":"Ravel","surface_form":"Ravel","offset":555},{"uri":"Impressionism","surface_form":"Impressionistic","offset":582},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":676},{"uri":"Stravinsky","surface_form":"Stravinsky","offset":701},{"uri":"Twelve_tone_music","surface_form":"twelve tone music","offset":715},{"uri":"Arnold_Schoenberg","surface_form":"Arnold Schoenberg","offset":738},{"uri":"Masculine","surface_form":"masculine","offset":815},{"uri":"Jazz","surface_form":"jazz","offset":843},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":1009},{"uri":"Jean_Cocteau","surface_form":"Jean Cocteau","offset":1082},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":1114},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":1241},{"uri":"Bar_(business)","surface_form":"bar","offset":1297},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":1637},{"uri":"The_Five","surface_form":"The Five","offset":1678}]}
