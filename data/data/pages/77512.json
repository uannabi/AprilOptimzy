{"id":77512,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Durey","text":"e=\"preserve\">Louis Durey (born Paris, 27 May 1888; died Saint-Tropez, France, 3 July 1979) was a French composer. He was the oldest, but probably the least well-known of the six composers who are called Les Six.\nLouis Durey was the son of a businessman. He had no idea that he wanted to be a composer until he heard the opera P\u00E9ll\u00E9as et M\u00E9lisande by Claude Debussy. He was then already 19 years old. He taught himself how to compose.\nDurey became a member of the group called Les Six in 1920. However, he did not take part in the music they wrote together in 1921 called \"Les Mari\u00E9s de la Tour Eiffel\". This made Jean Cocteau very annoyed.\nDurey became interested in left-wing politics and later joined the Communist Party. During the years of the Nazi occupation of World War II, he worked with the French Resistance and wrote anti-Fascist songs. After the war he had strong Communist ideas. This made it difficult for him to be successful in the world of music.\nIn 1950 he got the job of music critic for a communist newspaper in Paris.\nHe wrote a lot of music during his life, but there were many years when he wrote nothing. He composed songs, chamber music and choral works.\nLouis Durey died at Saint-Tropez, Provence-Alpes-C\u00F4te d'Azur, France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":31},{"uri":"27_May","surface_form":"27 May","offset":38},{"uri":"1888","surface_form":"1888","offset":45},{"uri":"Saint-Tropez","surface_form":"Saint-Tropez","offset":56},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":70},{"uri":"3_July","surface_form":"3 July","offset":78},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":85},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":97},{"uri":"Les_Six","surface_form":"Les Six","offset":203},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"opera","offset":320},{"uri":"P%C3%A9ll%C3%A9as_et_M%C3%A9lisande","surface_form":"P\u00E9ll\u00E9as et M\u00E9lisande","offset":326},{"uri":"Claude_Debussy","surface_form":"Claude Debussy","offset":350},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":487},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":559},{"uri":"Jean_Cocteau","surface_form":"Jean Cocteau","offset":613},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":677},{"uri":"Communism","surface_form":"Communist Party","offset":707},{"uri":"Nazism","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":748},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":767},{"uri":"French_Resistance","surface_form":"French Resistance","offset":800},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"anti-Fascist","offset":828},{"uri":"Music_critic","surface_form":"music critic","offset":990},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":1019},{"uri":"M%C3%A9lodie","surface_form":"songs","offset":1141},{"uri":"Chamber_music","surface_form":"chamber music","offset":1148},{"uri":"Choral","surface_form":"choral","offset":1166},{"uri":"Saint-Tropez","surface_form":"Saint-Tropez","offset":1200},{"uri":"Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te_d%27Azur","surface_form":"Provence-Alpes-C\u00F4te d'Azur","offset":1214},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1242}]}
