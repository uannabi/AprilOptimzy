{"id":775201,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Jarama","text":"The Lamborghini Jarama is a grand tourer car made by Lamborghini from 1970 to 1976. It is the successor to the Islero, and uses the same Lamborghini V12 as it. The Jarama was designed by Marcello Gandini.\nHistory.\nThe Jarama was designed to replace the Islero. It was introduced in 1970 at the Geneva Motor Show. Lamborghini built the Jarama to meet U.S. standards by using a modified version of the Espada\u2019s chassis. A total of 328 Jaramas were built.\nThe Jarama weighed dry, which was heavier than the Islero. It was powered by the same Lamborghini V12 engine that was used in the Islero and Espada. The engine sent power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual transmission. The original Jarama (1970\u20131973) model was claimed to produce.\nJarama S.\nThe Jarama S (also known as \"Jarama GTS\") was introduced in 1972. It had an upgraded engine, which allowed it to produce. The Jarama S featured a few minor exterior changes as well. Power assisted steering was standard on the Jarama S. Removable roof panels and a Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic transmission were also available as options. Lamborghini built 150 of the Jarama S.\nThe Jarama was Ferruccio Lamborghini\u2019s favorite model. Ferruccio stated in a 1991 interview that \"I preferred the Jarama to all the others, because it is the perfect compromise between the Miura and the Espada\"\nEngine and transmission.\nThe Jarama used the Lamborghini V12 from the Espada and the Islero. The engine produced in the standard Jarama, and in the Jarama S. The engine was paired to a five-speed manual transmission in the Jarama, with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission an option in the Jarama S.\nPerformance.\nThe Jarama S was able to accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour (0-97 kilometres per hour) in 5.3 seconds. It was also able to reach 100 miles per hour (161 kilometres per hour) in 11.7 seconds. The Jarama S had a quarter-mile time of 13.5 seconds, with a speed of 107 miles per hour at the end of the quarter mile.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Grand_tourer","surface_form":"grand tourer","offset":28},{"uri":"Lamborghini","surface_form":"Lamborghini","offset":53},{"uri":"Successor","surface_form":"successor","offset":94},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Islero","surface_form":"Islero","offset":111},{"uri":"Lamborghini_V12","surface_form":"Lamborghini V12","offset":137},{"uri":"Marcello_Gandini","surface_form":"Marcello Gandini","offset":187},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Islero","surface_form":"Islero","offset":253},{"uri":"Modified","surface_form":"modified","offset":376},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Espada","surface_form":"Espada","offset":400},{"uri":"Chassis","surface_form":"chassis","offset":409},{"uri":"Lamborghini_V12","surface_form":"Lamborghini V12 engine","offset":539},{"uri":"Manual_transmission","surface_form":"manual transmission","offset":661},{"uri":"Introduced","surface_form":"introduced","offset":800},{"uri":"Exterior","surface_form":"exterior","offset":910},{"uri":"Power_assisted_steering","surface_form":"Power assisted steering","offset":936},{"uri":"TorqueFlite","surface_form":"TorqueFlite","offset":1027},{"uri":"Automatic_transmission","surface_form":"automatic transmission","offset":1039},{"uri":"Available","surface_form":"available","offset":1072},{"uri":"Ferruccio_Lamborghini","surface_form":"Ferruccio Lamborghini","offset":1148},{"uri":"Interview","surface_form":"interview","offset":1215},{"uri":"Compromise","surface_form":"compromise","offset":1299},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Miura","surface_form":"Miura","offset":1322},{"uri":"Lamborghini_V12","surface_form":"Lamborghini V12","offset":1389},{"uri":"Manual_transmission","surface_form":"manual transmission","offset":1540},{"uri":"TorqueFlite","surface_form":"TorqueFlite","offset":1582},{"uri":"Automatic_transmission","surface_form":"automatic transmission","offset":1606},{"uri":"Accelerate","surface_form":"accelerate","offset":1694},{"uri":"Miles_per_hour","surface_form":"miles per hour","offset":1715},{"uri":"Kilometres_per_hour","surface_form":"kilometres per hour","offset":1736},{"uri":"Second","surface_form":"second","offset":1764}]}
