{"id":775252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_PSG-1","text":"The Heckler & Koch PSG-1 is a semi-automatic sniper rifle. It is made by the German gun company Heckler & Koch. PSG-1 is a shortening of the German word \"Pr\u00E4zisionssch\u00FCtzengewehr-1\", or literally the \"precision-shooting rifle\". It fires the 7.62x51mm NATO bullet. It is a heavily changed version of the G3 rifle. The Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics showed the need for West German police and counter-terrorists to have a precision rifle, which West Germany did not have at the time.\nThe PSG-1 is very accurate and has a large 20-round box magazine. However, its heavy weight, high price, lack of versatility, and its ease of jamming made the rifle not very practical, so it was eventually replaced by other sniper rifles. However, its unique look made it a popular weapon in video games. It appeared in games like the \"Metal Gear\" series, the \"Call of Duty\" series, the \"Rainbow Six\" series, and \"Resident Evil 5\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semi-automatic_firearm","surface_form":"semi-automatic","offset":30},{"uri":"Sniper_rifle","surface_form":"sniper rifle","offset":45},{"uri":"Heckler_%26amp%3B_Koch","surface_form":"Heckler & Koch","offset":96},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":141},{"uri":"7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO","surface_form":"7.62x51mm NATO","offset":241},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":256},{"uri":"Heckler_%26amp%3B_Koch_G3","surface_form":"G3","offset":303},{"uri":"Munich_massacre","surface_form":"Munich massacre","offset":317},{"uri":"1912_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1972 Summer Olympics","offset":344},{"uri":"West_Germany","surface_form":"West German","offset":385},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":397},{"uri":"Counter-terrorism","surface_form":"counter-terrorists","offset":408},{"uri":"Magazine_(firearms)","surface_form":"box magazine","offset":551},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":791},{"uri":"Metal_Gear_(Series)","surface_form":"\"Metal Gear\" series","offset":834},{"uri":"Call_of_Duty_series","surface_form":"\"Call of Duty\" series","offset":859},{"uri":"Rainbow_Six_series","surface_form":"\"Rainbow Six\" series","offset":886},{"uri":"Resident_Evil_5","surface_form":"\"Resident Evil 5\"","offset":912}]}
