{"id":775291,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleut_language","text":"=\"preserve\">The Aleut language is spoken by the Aleut people, who live in the U.S. state of Alaska and in Russia. They call their language \"Unangam Tunuu\" and call themselves \"Unangax\u0302\".\nThe Aleut language is an endangered language because fewer people are speaking it. The Aleut are trying to teach the language to others and encourage them to use it so it won't die out.\nAlphabet.\nAleut uses two alphabets, the Latin alphabet (the ABCs) and the Cyrillic alphabet.\nGrammar.\nIn Aleut, new words are created by adding suffixes to a base word called a stem.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aleut","surface_form":"Aleut","offset":48},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":78},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":92},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":106},{"uri":"Endangered_language","surface_form":"endangered language","offset":212},{"uri":"Latin_alphabet","surface_form":"Latin alphabet","offset":413},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic alphabet","offset":447}]}
