{"id":775304,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_porn","text":"e=\"preserve\">Revenge pornography is the act of getting revenge toward somebody by way of pornography. This act of revenge is usually done without asking the victim.\nRevenge porn usually means making sexually explicit videos, books and movies about a person because the person ended a relationship. The possession of the material may be used by the partners to punish the victim for ending a relationship.\nSeveral areas have passed laws against revenge porn. They include Israel, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and most of the\nUnited States.\nIn the 1980s the \"Hustler\" magazine began a monthly show of reader-submitted images of naked women called the \"Beaver Hunt\". The Beaver Hunt photos were usually with details of these women, such as their hobby and their names. Some of the women sued the magazine for publishing their photos without their permission.\nBut it wasn't until 2010 that revenge porn \"really\" took off. That year,\nHunter Moore launched the website \"IsAnyoneUp\". The website was similar to the Beaver Hunt. The first person who spoke against Moore was activist Charlotte Laws. She was also one of the first people to publicly support revenge pornography victims.\nIn June 2015 Google decided they would remove links to revenge porn on request. Microsoft did the same in July.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pornography","surface_form":"pornography","offset":89},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":217},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":225},{"uri":"Movies","surface_form":"movies","offset":235},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":471},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":479},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":487},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":498},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":529},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":960},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":1195},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":1262}]}
