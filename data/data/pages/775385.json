{"id":775385,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Oread_Civil_War_posts","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lawrence, Kansas was not well defended in the early part of the American Civil War. They started defending it after William Quantrill's guerrilla raid on August 21, 1863. By early 1864 Union soldiers permanently stayed on the top and hills of Mount Oread, which was at Lawrence's southwest. It seems the camp was first named Camp Ewing, after Brig. Gen. Thomas Ewing.\nThe military area on Mount Oread was used until the end of the Civil War. When the war ended, there was no reason to keep them, so they were destroyed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lawrence%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Lawrence, Kansas","offset":13},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":77},{"uri":"William_Quantrill","surface_form":"William Quantrill","offset":129},{"uri":"Lawrence_massacre","surface_form":"guerrilla raid","offset":149},{"uri":"Mount_Oread","surface_form":"Mount Oread","offset":256},{"uri":"Thomas_Ewing","surface_form":"Thomas Ewing","offset":367}]}
