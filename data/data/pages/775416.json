{"id":775416,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Sesto_Elemento","text":"The Lamborghini Sesto Elemento is a supercar. Lamborghini made it in 2011. It is a track day car. This means that it is not allowed on a public road. Lamborghini only made 20 Sesto Elementos. The car\u2019s name means \u201Csixth element\u201D in Italian. This is because carbon is the sixth element on the periodic table and the car uses a lot of carbon fibre.\nHistory.\nIn mid-2011, Lamborghini announced that they would make 20 cars for track use only. Each car would cost US$2.92 million. All 20 cars had already been sold by the time Lamborghini started building them. At that time, the Sesto Elemento was the most expensive Lamborghini ever created. It stayed that way until they made the Veneno. The Veneno\u2019s price was as high as \u00A34,162,150 (US$6.5 million).\nEngine and transmission.\nThe Sesto Elemento uses Lamborghinis\u2019s 5.2 litre V10 engine. It is the same engine as in the Gallardo. It makes and of torque. The engine is paired with Lamborghini\u2019s six-speed semi-automatic transmission. It powers all four wheels through an all-wheel drive system. Almost all of the Sesto Elemento is made of carbon fibre. This means that the car only weighs.\nPerformance.\nLamborghini says that the Sesto Elemento can go from in 2.5 seconds. Lamborghini also says that the Sesto Elemento can go from in 8.0 seconds. It has a top speed of.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supercar","surface_form":"supercar","offset":36},{"uri":"Lamborghini","surface_form":"Lamborghini","offset":46},{"uri":"Italian","surface_form":"Italian","offset":232},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":257},{"uri":"Element","surface_form":"element","offset":277},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":292},{"uri":"Carbon_fibre","surface_form":"carbon fibre","offset":333},{"uri":"2011","surface_form":"2011","offset":363},{"uri":"Announced","surface_form":"announced","offset":381},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"US$","offset":460},{"uri":"Lamborghini_V%C3%A9neno","surface_form":"Veneno","offset":679},{"uri":"Lamborghini_V10","surface_form":"V10 engine","offset":824},{"uri":"Lamborghini_Gallardo","surface_form":"Gallardo","offset":868},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":894},{"uri":"Semi-automatic_transmission","surface_form":"semi-automatic transmission","offset":952},{"uri":"All-wheel_drive","surface_form":"all-wheel drive","offset":1018},{"uri":"Carbon_fibre","surface_form":"carbon fibre","offset":1086}]}
