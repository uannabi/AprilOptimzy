It was taken over by Tommy Gagliano during the Castellammarese War, and led by him until his death in 1951.\nKnown as the Gagliano crime family under Gagliano, was peaceful and low key. The next boss was Tommy Lucchese who served as Gagliano's underboss for over 20 years, who turned the family around to become one of the most powerful families to sit on the Commission. Lucchese teamed up with Gambino crime family boss Carlo Gambino to control organized crime in New York City.\nWhen Lucchese died of a brain tumor in 1967, Carmine Tramunti controlled the family for a short time. He was arrested in 1973 for funding a major heroin network and died five years later. Anthony Corallo then gained control of the family.
