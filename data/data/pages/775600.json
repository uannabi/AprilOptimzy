It is in the grounds of Westminster Abbey next to the Palace of Westminster. It was the church of the House of Commons since 1614 - 1972. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called \"Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey and Saint Margaret's Church\". The church was first started in the 12th century by Benedictine monks. The building that stands now was built between 1486 and 1523. The church is dedicated to Margaret of Antioch.\nSt. Margaret's is the parish church for this part of Westminster. Other grand ecclesiastical places in the area do not perform this function. Until modern times, Westminster had large numbers of ordinary people living in the parish who could not, or did not, use the grand churches for their spiritual needs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"Anglican","offset":51},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":60},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":70},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":83},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster Abbey","offset":124},{"uri":"Palace_of_Westminster","surface_form":"Palace of Westminster","offset":154},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons","offset":202},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":256},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":263},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":398},{"uri":"Order_of_Saint_Benedict","surface_form":"Benedictine monks","offset":414},{"uri":"Margaret_of_Antioch","surface_form":"Margaret of Antioch","offset":522},{"uri":"Parish","surface_form":"parish","offset":565},{"uri":"Ecclesiastes","surface_form":"ecclesiastical","offset":621}]}
