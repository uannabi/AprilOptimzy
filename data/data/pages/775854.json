Honken was involved in the creation and selling of methamphetamine and one of his dealers was set to testify against him, and so Honken and Johnson murdered him along with his girlfriend and her two daughters (age 6 and 10). A few months later, the fifth victim, also a former dealer, was murdered.\nDustin Honken was sentenced to death and executed on July 17, 2020, the first person from Iowa to be executed since 1963.\nAngela Johnson was also sentenced to death, the first woman sentenced to death by a United States federal jury since the 1950s, but the sentence was overturned in 2012 and she was re-sentenced to life without parole in 2014.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Iowa","surface_form":"Iowa","offset":180},{"uri":"Methamphetamine","surface_form":"methamphetamine","offset":294},{"uri":"Sentenced_to_death","surface_form":"sentenced to death","offset":560},{"uri":"Federal_jury","surface_form":"federal jury","offset":762},{"uri":"Life_without_parole","surface_form":"life without parole","offset":860}]}
