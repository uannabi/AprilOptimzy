He entered the election after missing at least four states' deadlines to appear on the ballot as a third-party candidate.\nWest has picked Michelle Tidball, a preacher from Wyoming, as his running mate. West's rhetoric has been described as right-wing, along with having \"a Republican-leaning, pro-Black religious platform\".\nOn July 16, 2020, the campaign filed a Statement of Candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. West has qualified for ballot access in Oklahoma and held a rally in South Carolina.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kanye_West","surface_form":"Kanye West","offset":0},{"uri":"Twitter","surface_form":"Twitter","offset":60},{"uri":"Independence_Day_(United_States)","surface_form":"Independence Day","offset":85},{"uri":"Wyoming","surface_form":"Wyoming","offset":367},{"uri":"Running_mate","surface_form":"running mate","offset":383},{"uri":"Right-wing_politics","surface_form":"right-wing","offset":435},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":468},{"uri":"Federal_Election_Commission","surface_form":"Federal Election Commission","offset":590}]}
