{"id":776071,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_and_moon_letters","text":"In Arabic and Maltese, consonants are divided into two groups: the sun/solar letters (', Maltese: konsonanti xemxin) and moon/lunar letters (', Maltese: konsonanti qamrin).\nIn those languages, all nouns start with the word \"al\" (\u0627\u0644\u0640) in Arabic or \"il\" in Maltese. Both words mean \"the.\" If a sun letter comes after the consonant, the \"l\" sound in \"al\" or \"il\" is dropped and is replaced by whatever sound the letter makes. However, if a moon letter comes after, the \"l\" sound in those words stays.\nIn Arabic, the word for \"the sun\" is \"ash-shams\" because the \"sh\" sound is a sun letter. Meanwhile, the word for \"the moon\" is \"al-qamar\" because the \"q\" sound is a moon letter.\nRule.\nBelow is a chart of the sun and moon letters in Arabic.\nWriting.\nThe \u0627\u0644 \"<nowiki/>'al- is written down in Arabic regardless of how it is pronounced. In the case of sun letters, a mark called the \"shaddah\" (\u0640\u0651\u0640) is written over the sun letter. For moon letters, a mark called the \"sukun\" (\u0640\u0652\u0640)is written over the letter \u0644 \"lam\" in the \"al-.\"\nMaltese.\nBelow is a chart of the sun and moon letters in Maltese.\nIf a word starts with any of the moon letters, the word il- stays the same. However, if it stats with a sun letter, the word il-changes to i\u010B-, id-, in-, ir-, is-, it-, ix-, i\u017C-, iz-.\nIf a word begins with two consonants, it changes to \"l-i-.\" For example, \"skola\" (school) becomes \"l-i'\"skola\" (the school).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":3},{"uri":"Maltese_language","surface_form":"Maltese","offset":14},{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonants","offset":23},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":527},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"moon","offset":616}]}
