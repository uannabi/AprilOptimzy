The Si\u00E1n is based off the Aventador. Lamborghini will only make 63 Si\u00E1ns. The Si\u00E1n is the first Lamborghini to have a hybrid powertrain. This means that the car is powered by both a gas engine and an electric motor.\nHistory.\nLamborghini first showed the Si\u00E1n FKP 37 at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show. The car\u2019s name was made to honor Ferdinand Pi\u00EBch. Pi\u00EBch had died a couple months before the Si\u00E1n was first shown. \"FKP\" was the initials of Pi\u00EBch\u2018s name. The \"37\" came from Pi\u00EBch\u2018s birth year, which was 1937.\nProduction.\nLamborghini will only build 63 Si\u00E1n FKP 37s. This is because Lamborghini started making road cars in 1963. All 63 Si\u00E1ns have already been sold.\nEngine and transmission.\nThe Si\u00E1n FKP 37 is based off the Aventador, and shares its 6.5 litre Lamborghini V12 engine with the Aventador. The Si\u00E1n also has an electric motor, which adds another to the car\u2019s horsepower level. The V12 makes in the Si\u00E1n. The total power output of the car is. That makes it the most powerful Lamborghini ever made. The engine is paired with a version of the Aventador\u2019s seven-speed automated manual transmission.

Lamborghini says that the Si\u00E1n will have a top speed of.\nSi\u00E1n FKP 37 Roadster.\nIn July 2020, Lamborghini first showed the Si\u00E1n FKP 37 Roadster. Only 19 Roadsters will be made. All of them have already been sold.
