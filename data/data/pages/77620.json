{"id":77620,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaine_Tailleferre","text":"Germaine Tailleferre (born Saint Maur Des Foss\u00E9s, France, 19 April 1892; died Paris, 7 November 1983) was a French composer. She was one of the members of the famous group Les Six.\nShe was called Marcelle Taillefesse when she was born. When she was grown up she changed her last name to \"Tailleferre\" just to annoy her father because he had refused to let her study music. She studied piano with her mother at home, composing short works of her own and then began studying at the Paris Conservatoire. There she met Louis Durey, Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, Georges Auric and Arthur Honegger. She won several prizes at the Conservatoire. She often met with her friends who became known as Les Six.\nIn 1923 Tailleferre began to spend a great deal of time with Maurice Ravel at his home in Monfort-L'Amaury. Ravel encouraged her to enter the \"Prix de Rome\" Competition. In 1925, she married Ralph Barton, an American caricaturist, and moved to Manhattan, New York. She stayed in the United States until 1927 when she and her husband returned to France. They divorced shortly afterwards.\nTailleferre wrote many of her most important works during the 1920s, including her 1st Piano Concerto, The Harp Concertino, the Ballets \"Le Marchand d'Oiseaux\" (the most often performed ballet in the repertoire of the Ballets Su\u00E9doises during the 1920s) and \"La Nouvelle Cyth\u00E8re\" which Diaghilev had asked her to write for his ballet company.\nIn the 1930s she composed the Concerto for Two Pianos, Choeurs, Saxophones and Orchestra, the Violin Concerto, the Operas \"Zoula\u00EFna\" and \"Le Marin de Bolivar\", and her masterwork, \"La Cantate de Narcisse\", which she wrote with Paul Val\u00E9ry. Her work in film music included \"Le Petit Chose\".\nWhen World War II started she had to escape across Spain to Portugal and from there to America.\nAfter the war, in 1946, she returned to her home in France where she composed a lot more music, much of which was not published until after her death. She was accompanist at a children's music and movement class. She wrote shorter pieces towards the end of her life because her arthritis made writing difficult.\nTailleferre carried on composing until a few weeks before her death in November 1983.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":50},{"uri":"19_April","surface_form":"19 April","offset":58},{"uri":"1892","surface_form":"1892","offset":67},{"uri":"7_November","surface_form":"7 November","offset":85},{"uri":"1983","surface_form":"1983","offset":96},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":108},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":115},{"uri":"Les_Six","surface_form":"Les Six","offset":172},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":366},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":385},{"uri":"Paris_Conservatoire","surface_form":"Paris Conservatoire","offset":480},{"uri":"Louis_Durey","surface_form":"Louis Durey","offset":515},{"uri":"Francis_Poulenc","surface_form":"Francis Poulenc","offset":528},{"uri":"Darius_Milhaud","surface_form":"Darius Milhaud","offset":545},{"uri":"Georges_Auric","surface_form":"Georges Auric","offset":561},{"uri":"Arthur_Honegger","surface_form":"Arthur Honegger","offset":579},{"uri":"Les_Six","surface_form":"Les Six","offset":692},{"uri":"1923","surface_form":"1923","offset":704},{"uri":"Maurice_Ravel","surface_form":"Maurice Ravel","offset":762},{"uri":"Prix_de_Rome","surface_form":"Prix de Rome","offset":844},{"uri":"1925","surface_form":"1925","offset":874},{"uri":"Caricature","surface_form":"caricaturist","offset":918},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":945},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":956},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":984},{"uri":"1927","surface_form":"1927","offset":1004},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":1059},{"uri":"Repertoire","surface_form":"repertoire","offset":1288},{"uri":"Diaghilev","surface_form":"Diaghilev","offset":1374},{"uri":"1930s","surface_form":"1930s","offset":1438},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":1726},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1772},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":1781},{"uri":"1946","surface_form":"1946","offset":1835},{"uri":"Accompaniment_(music)","surface_form":"accompanist","offset":1976},{"uri":"Arthritis","surface_form":"arthritis","offset":2095}]}
