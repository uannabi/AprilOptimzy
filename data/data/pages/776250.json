He is known for his unlikely survival of an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe. This caused effects on his personality and behavior over the remaining 12 years of his life.\nGage was born in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He died on May 21, 1860 in the San Francisco Bay Area from status epilepticus (a form of a seizure), aged 36.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brain_damage","surface_form":"destroying","offset":212},{"uri":"Frontal_lobe","surface_form":"frontal lobe","offset":248},{"uri":"Lebanon%2C_New_Hampshire","surface_form":"Lebanon, New Hampshire","offset":372},{"uri":"San_Francisco_Bay_Area","surface_form":"San Francisco Bay Area","offset":427},{"uri":"Status_epilepticus","surface_form":"status epilepticus","offset":455},{"uri":"Seizure","surface_form":"seizure","offset":487}]}
