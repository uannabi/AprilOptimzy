{"id":77640,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea","text":"Pangaea was the global supercontinent which formed in the Palaeozoic era. The process started about 450 million years ago (mya) and was complete by 210 mya.\nPangea was the latest of a series of global supercontinents. They formed at various times since plate tectonics began on Earth.Generally Pangea and Gondwana are considered as parts of the same supercontinent Gondwana-Pangea.(Reference -https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286392394_Earth_as_an_Evolving_Planetary_System).\nFormation.\nThe collisions between continental plates formed the greatest mountain ranges in the history of the Phanerozoic eon. The mountain building included the Caledonian orogeny, the Alleghenian orogeny and the Variscan orogeny. The low mountains of Scotland, Scandinavia and eastern North America are the ground-down remains of these vast events.\nBreak-up.\nThere were three major phases in the break-up of Pangaea. Actually, the first signs of rifting came in the Triassic before Pangaea was completely formed.\nPangaea broke up about 180/200 million years ago, in the early middle Jurassic. It broke into supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana before each of these broke into the current continents. One rift resulted in a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean.\nThe second major phase in the break-up of Pangaea began in the Lower Cretaceous (150\u2013140\u00A0Ma), when Gondwana separated into multiple continents (Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia).\nThe third major and final phase of the break-up of Pangaea occurred in the early Cenozoic (Paleocene to Oligocene). Laurasia split when North America/Greenland (also called Laurentia) broke free from Eurasia, opening the Norwegian Sea about 60\u201355\u00A0Ma. The Atlantic and Indian Oceans continued to expand, closing the Tethys Ocean.\nThe break-up of Pangaea continues today in the Great Rift Valley in East Africa and Arabia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supercontinent","surface_form":"supercontinent","offset":23},{"uri":"Palaeozoic","surface_form":"Palaeozoic","offset":58},{"uri":"Era","surface_form":"era","offset":69},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":104},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"plate tectonics","offset":253},{"uri":"Continental_plate","surface_form":"continental plate","offset":518},{"uri":"Phanerozoic","surface_form":"Phanerozoic","offset":595},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"eon","offset":607},{"uri":"Caledonian_orogeny","surface_form":"Caledonian orogeny","offset":647},{"uri":"Allegheny_Mountains","surface_form":"Alleghenian orogeny","offset":671},{"uri":"Variscan_orogeny","surface_form":"Variscan orogeny","offset":699},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":738},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":748},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":772},{"uri":"Rift_(geology)","surface_form":"rifting","offset":933},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":953},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":1070},{"uri":"Laurasia","surface_form":"Laurasia","offset":1110},{"uri":"Gondwana","surface_form":"Gondwana","offset":1123},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":1232},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":1311},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":1392},{"uri":"South_America","surface_form":"South America","offset":1400},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":1415},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":1422},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1438},{"uri":"Cenozoic","surface_form":"Cenozoic","offset":1531},{"uri":"Paleocene","surface_form":"Paleocene","offset":1541},{"uri":"Oligocene","surface_form":"Oligocene","offset":1554},{"uri":"Laurasia","surface_form":"Laurasia","offset":1566},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":1586},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":1600},{"uri":"Laurentia","surface_form":"Laurentia","offset":1623},{"uri":"Norwegian_Sea","surface_form":"Norwegian Sea","offset":1671},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":1718},{"uri":"Tethys_Ocean","surface_form":"Tethys Ocean","offset":1765},{"uri":"Great_Rift_Valley","surface_form":"Great Rift Valley","offset":1826},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":1847},{"uri":"Arabia","surface_form":"Arabia","offset":1863}]}
