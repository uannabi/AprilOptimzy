{"id":776480,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_Memorial","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial is a United States presidential memorial honoring Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during World War II and the 34th President of the United States.\nOn October 25, 1999, the United States Congress created the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, and charged it with creating \"...an appropriate permanent memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower\".\nAn early design by architect Frank Gehry was controversial. After several years of hearings and several design changes by Gehry, final design approvals were given in 2015.\nAfter more than a decade and a half of planning and controversy, Congress approved $150 million to the memorial in 2017 and on November 2, dignitaries held a groundbreaking ceremony at the four-acre site in Washington DC.\nThe dedication was scheduled for May 8, 2020, the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, now postponed to September 17, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":52},{"uri":"Memorial","surface_form":"memorial","offset":79},{"uri":"Dwight_D._Eisenhower","surface_form":"Dwight D.
