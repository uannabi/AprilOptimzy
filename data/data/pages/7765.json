{"id":7765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses","text":"Jehovah's Witnesses\u00A0are a\u00A0religious group\u00A0with more than eight million members around the world. They believe\u00A0God, who they call Jehovah,\u00A0will end crime, violence, sickness and death by destroying all wickedness in the world. They say that God's Kingdom (mentioned (thy Kingdom come) in the Lord's prayer) will restore God's original purpose for the Earth: bringing about peace for all humans who live by\u00A0Bible standards.\nTheir beliefs are based solely upon the Bible. These beliefs were taught by\u00A0Charles Taze Russell, a preacher who started a Bible study group in\u00A0Pennsylvania\u00A0in 1876. The goal of Russell and other Bible Students, as the group was then known, was to promote the teachings of Jesus Christ and to follow the practices of the first-century Christian congregation. Since Jesus is the Founder of Christianity, they view him as the founder of their organization.\u2014Colossians 1:18-20. They later started publishing a religious magazine called\u00A0\"The Watchtower\".\nSome of their beliefs, especially about who God is and what his plans are for humans and the earth, are different from what is taught in most Christian churches. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will go to heaven and that all the other people who obey God will live\u00A0forever\u00A0on a\u00A0paradise\u00A0Earth. They do not believe that God is a\u00A0Trinity. They believe Jesus died on a pole (also called '[torture] stake') rather than a cross. They teach that when people die, they remain in the grave until\u00A0Jesus resurrects them after God's Kingdom, or government, is ruling over earth.\nJehovah's Witnesses are best known for\u00A0preaching\u00A0their beliefs from door-to-door and in other public places, and offering their magazines,\u00A0\"The Watchtower\"\u00A0and\u00A0\"Awake!\"\u00A0They are also well known for refusing to join armies and refusing blood transfusions.\nHistory.\nIn 1870 a young clothing shop owner named Charles Taze Russell heard an Adventist preacher speak. The preacher said the Bible contained clues that showed God was about to set up a kingdom, or government, over earth. He said the kingdom, which is mentioned many times in the New Testament of the Bible, would be based in heaven, and it would completely change the way of life for everyone in the world. Russell studied that preacher's teachings and looked through the Bible, and ended up with some new beliefs.\nBeginnings.\nUsing various Bible verses and events from history, Russell decided that God would soon call a group of \"saints\" to heaven to be kings there. Other faithful Christians who had since died would also make up a total of 144,000 kings in heaven. Churches at the time taught that humans were still waiting for Jesus to return to earth in his Second Coming, but Russell believed that clues in the Bible showed Jesus returned in 1874. Russell believed part of God's plan was to start Armageddon, which he thought would be a complete breakdown of law and order on earth, when governments and people would fight among themselves. He believed that God would then end sickness and death and allow obedient Christians to live forever in perfect health.\nRussell believed it was very important that all Christians, including those who were attending churches, should learn those \"truths\". He believed these \"truths\" had been carefully hidden in the Bible for thousands of years. He started a publishing group called the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. He wrote several books, set up some Bible study classes for people to study his teachings, and started a magazine, \"Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence\", which taught that Christ was already present. He wrote that God would bring about all those events by 1914.\nA new president.\nBy the time Russell died in 1916, he had written 50,000 pages, with almost 20 million copies of his books printed and distributed around the world. Joseph Franklin Rutherford, one of his followers, took Russell's position as president of the Watch Tower Society.\nRutherford wrote many books as well. He made some changes to Russell's teachings and required all the study groups, or congregations, around the world to agree to the teachings and rules set by the Watch Tower Society in New York. He told all members to preach from door to door about God's Kingdom and to distribute Watch Tower Society publications so more people would hear the message. Many members did not agree with Rutherford's changes, and some started their own groups. In 1931 Rutherford called his group \"Jehovah's Witnesses\" to tell it apart from the other groups. By the time Rutherford died in 1942, the religion had a worldwide membership of 115,000.\nPunishment and discrimination.\nSome of the new teachings resulted in suffering for many Jehovah's Witnesses. Thousands were sent to prison, beaten or killed in several countries during World War II because they refused to fight. In Germany, many were sent to concentration camps because they would not support the Nazi Party. Later, in the United States, many of their children were expelled from schools because they refused to salute the flag, because they thought that God would not approve. Some countries still have laws against members practicing the religion. By 1977 they had more than two million members around the world.\nArmageddon expected in 1975.\nFrom 1966, the religion suggested that God could bring Armageddon in 1975, and that the Kingdom would be set up very soon after. Some Witnesses sold businesses and homes, gave up jobs, delayed medical operations and decided against starting a family because they expected Armageddon to arrive. Many members that assumed Armageddon would come in 1975 left at the time, but many other people joined and the group kept growing.\nOne God.\nLike many Christian religions, Jehovah's Witnesses believe there is an all-powerful, all-knowing God who created everything. They also have some beliefs that are different from most Christians. They believe God calls himself Jehovah (a translation of the Hebrew letters \"YHWH\") and they believe it is important to use that name. In which, 'God' is a title, as to, daughter, mother, father, son and etc. This is why it is important to address our father by his name. They believe Jesus is God's son, the first angel, and that he is also called Michael the Archangel. They say the holy spirit is God's power rather than a person. They do not believe in the Trinity. They believe the Bible is a book that God used humans to write and that it is completely true and the best guide for how people should live.\nAdam and Eve.\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that God made Adam and Eve, the first humans, and put them in a garden called Eden. They believe that when Adam and Eve sinned, they no longer had God's approval so they began to get sick and die. They were not perfect any more and could not have perfect children. Because of this, humans could not remain sinless. They believe that Jehovah later sent Jesus to die (on a pole (stake), not a cross, as most Christians believe, which is known as 'Christendom') to forgive mankind's sins.\nHeaven.\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people, a number found in Revelation chapters 7 and 14, will go to heaven to be kings and priests with Jesus Christ. They say that God will start a worldwide war called Armageddon, and the people who do not obey God or worship him the way he expects will be killed. The people who he approves will survive and be given the opportunity to live forever. Then God will begin to turn Earth into a paradise without crime, sickness, pain, aging, wars or death. They say God will also resurrect (bring back to life) billions of people who died in the past so they can learn about God and have a chance to live in paradise as well.\nJehovah's Witnesses believe only their religion really obeys God's instructions and that God does not approve of any other religions (including Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists and Muslims) because they do not follow the Bible the right way. They believe that Satan the Devil is the real leader of all other religions and makes them think they worship God the right way. (AKA: Satan the Devil is the ruler of this wicked world, but only for a short time).(1 John 5:19) So they believe that only Jehovah's Witnesses will be saved at Armageddon, but they say God will make the final choice.\nDoor-to-door work.\nJehovah's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching. They believe Jesus ordered them at to \"go make disciples of all the nations\", warning people that the day of God's judgement, or Armageddon, will happen soon. Jehovah's Witnesses believe their preaching is a fulfillment of a prophecy at Matthew 24:14, \"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\" All Witnesses are told to spend as much time as they can in public preaching work, usually offering \"The Watchtower\" and other Watch Tower Society publications. Since the Internet, Jehovah's Witnesses also preach online. They teach people their beliefs about Jehovah and his plans for the earth. Members are asked to give a monthly written report on how much time they have spent publicly preaching.\nMeetings.\nMembers unable to attend in person can also listen to the meeting over the phone or by video streaming where available. They also attend one large regional convention and two circuit assemblies a year (some of them at hired sports arenas), where hundreds or thousands of members gather depending on the location.\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses hold meetings for worship twice each week. (Hebrews 10:24, 25) At these meetings, which are open to the public, they examine what the Bible says and how to apply its teachings in life. At some meetings, people in the audience, including children, are invited to answer questions and make comments. The religion has elders and ministerial servants who take the spiritual lead in their congregations, but they do not dress differently to other members and they are not paid. Most elders support themselves with jobs outside the religion.\nRules.\nMembers of the religion are expected to live up to high moral standards. They are told they should always be honest.\nJehovah's Witnesses are told to marry only other baptized Jehovah's Witnesses. They believe God does not like married couples to divorce unless the husband or wife cheated. They can separate from a partner who hurt their family or refused to support them, but they would not be allowed to marry someone else.\nThey also refuse blood transfusions because the Bible says not to eat blood or consume it in any other way, and they believe that putting blood in their veins is equivalent to consuming it.\nThey are told not to make close friends with non-Witnesses because they could make their faith in God weaker, or possible sever their relationship with Him completely.\nMembership.\nJehovah's Witnesses are quite strict about who can be a member. Jehovah's Witnesses are only counted as members if they are baptized. Like other Christian groups, they believe baptism represents devotion to God and their promise to live by his teachings. Unlike some Christian groups, Witnesses are not baptized as babies. They believe baptism should be a choice made by someone who understands what it means.\nIf the elders think a baptized Witness has willingly disobeyed direction set forth in the Bible, they will investigate. That investigation is called a \"judicial committee\". If the elders decide the person is 'guilty' and does not regret what they did, he or she might be \"disfellowshipped\". This means the person is no longer a member of the group. When that happens, no other Jehovah's Witnesses are allowed to talk to or interact with that person (except in some situations such as living or working together) unless the disfellowshipped person repents and is allowed back in. When such a person is allowed back in, they have been 'reinstated'.\nSome people, including former Witnesses, have criticized this punishment as harsh and unfair. The style of leadership of the group has also been described by some authors as autocratic and totalitarian, because members have to be completely submissive to the direction of Jehovah as found in the Bible to the greatest extent they possibly can.\nOfficial.\nJehovah's Witnesses' brochures about the name Jehovah","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Christian
