{"id":776828,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulette_Wilson","text":"e=\"preserve\">Paulette Wilson (1956 \u2013 23 July 2020) was a British immigrant rights activist. She fought her own deportation to Jamaica and brought media attention to the human rights violations of the Windrush scandal. Under the terms of the British Nationality Act 1948, Wilson had arrived in England as citizens of the British Empire.\nIn 2015, Wilson received notification from the government that she was an illegal immigrant and was required to leave the UK. Her housing and health care benefits were stopped. She became homeless and was denied the right to seek work.\nBy 2017, Wilson was facing deportation. She had not returned to Jamaica for 50 years, but was arrested twice, detained in Yarl's Wood Detention Centre and then sent to the deportation centre at Heathrow Airport in October 2017.\nThe Refugee and Migrant Centre of Wolverhampton persuaded her MP, Emma Reynolds, to stop the deportation at the last minute to allow Wilson more time to appeal to the Home Office. In 2018, she was officially granted leave to remain.\nWilson died on 23 July 2020 in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England at the age of 64.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Deportation","surface_form":"deportation","offset":111},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"human rights","offset":169},{"uri":"Windrush_scandal","surface_form":"Windrush scandal","offset":200},{"uri":"British_Nationality_Act_1948","surface_form":"British Nationality Act 1948","offset":241},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":320},{"uri":"Yarl%27s_Wood_Immigration_Removal_Centre","surface_form":"Yarl's Wood Detention Centre","offset":694},{"uri":"Heathrow_Airport","surface_form":"Heathrow Airport","offset":766},{"uri":"Wolverhampton","surface_form":"Wolverhampton","offset":834},{"uri":"Emma_Reynolds","surface_form":"Emma Reynolds","offset":866},{"uri":"Home_Office","surface_form":"Home Office","offset":967},{"uri":"West_Midlands_(county)","surface_form":"West Midlands","offset":1079}]}
