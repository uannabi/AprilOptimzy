The cost of the Dumat Al-Jandal wind power plant is $ 500 million, and after the construction works are completed, the station will be able to generate sustainable energy sufficient for about 70,000 housing units. The \"Dumat Al-Jandal\" project was chosen as the first wind energy project in Saudi Arabia, after studies showed a strong mixture of wind capabilities at the project site, so that the expected average production for the wind station is about 1.4 Terawatts.\nThe project was granted based on the standard cost of electricity, which equals 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour, which was a new record for a project of this kind in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Dumat Al-Jandal wind farm will provide electric power according to a 20-year energy purchase agreement with the Saudi Energy Purchase Company, a subsidiary of the Saudi Electricity Company, the agency responsible for generating and distributing energy in Saudi Arabia.\nThe Deal of the Year award for the renewable energy sector in the Middle East and Africa 2019.\nDumat Al-Jandal wind farm project won the Best Renewable Project by Project Finance International (PFI) in the Middle East and Africa for the year 2019. After the project achievement of a new record of recording the lowest standard electricity generation rate of $ 0.0199 per kWh.\nThe beginning of the project.\nWork began on the farm in the middle of the calendar year 2019, and it is expected that the project will start generating energy in the last quarter of 2020, and work on the project will end in 2022.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":80},{"uri":"Riyadh","surface_form":"Riyadh","offset":206},{"uri":"Sustainable_energy","surface_form":"sustainable energy","offset":366},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":560},{"uri":"Cent","surface_form":"cents","offset":768},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":846},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":858},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":874}]}
