{"id":77734,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licchavi","text":"e=\"preserve\">Licchavi (also \"Lichchhavi\", \"Lichavi\") was an ancient republic which existed in what is now Bihar state of India, before the birth of Mahavira (b. 599 BC). Its capital was Vaishali.\nFrom about 400 to 750 there existed a kingdom in Nepal in the Kathmandu Valley with the same name \"Licchavi\".\nOrigins of the kingdom Licchavi.\nEarly Buddhist legends tell that Licchavi was a ruling family during Gautama Buddha's time in India, however links to the Nepalese kingdom are speculative. The language of Licchavi inscriptions is Sanskrit, and the particular script used is closely related to official Gupta scripts. That means that India was a significant cultural influence. This was likely through Mithila - the northern part of modern Bihar, India.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient","offset":60},{"uri":"Republic","surface_form":"republic","offset":68},{"uri":"Bihar","surface_form":"Bihar","offset":106},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":121},{"uri":"Mahavira","surface_form":"Mahavira","offset":148},{"uri":"Vaishali","surface_form":"Vaishali","offset":186},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":245},{"uri":"Kathmandu","surface_form":"Kathmandu","offset":258},{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":345},{"uri":"Gautama_Buddha","surface_form":"Gautama Buddha","offset":408},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":433},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":536},{"uri":"Gupta","surface_form":"Gupta","offset":608},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":639},{"uri":"Mithila","surface_form":"Mithila","offset":707},{"uri":"Bihar","surface_form":"Bihar","offset":745}]}
