{"id":777419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litoria_hunti","text":"\"Litoria hunti\" is a tree frog from northern Papua New Guinea. The New Guineans call it \"Wowo.\" Scientists have only seen it in Utai, which is in Sanduan Province, but they think it lives in many other places on the island of New Guinea.\nThe adult male frog has pads on its feet called nuptual pads. The adult male frog is 5.8 to 6.0 cm in length. It is bright green on the back and sometimes has a white stripe from its jaw to its ear. The climbing discs on its feet are white. It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw.\nScientists could hear this frog calling from the trees 5 to 8 meters above the ground, so they think it lays eggs in pools on the forest floor. But they did not see the frogs doing this.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":21},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":45},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":226},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":421}]}
