{"id":777642,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vouziers","text":"Vouziers () is a commune of the Ardennes department in northern France.\nVouziers is known for being the burial place of the pioneer First World War fighter pilot, after whom the Stade Roland Garros in Paris (the location of the French Open tennis tournament) is named. Tom\u00E1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk (the first president of Czechoslovakia) fought at Vouziers with the Czechoslovak Legion in France; there is a monument to the legion, and the president's name given to the city lycee (high school). The cellist and conductor Jean Witkowski was born in Vouziers on 23 May 1895.\nThe town was also known for the solar eclipse of August 11, 1999. It hosted a major observation event. Because of its closeness to the Belgian border, it was gridlocked by visiting Belgian cars on the morning of the eclipse.\nGeographical information.\nThe river Aisne flows through Vouziers, doubled by a branch of the \"canal des Ardennes\".\nThe town lies between the Forest of Argonne, the pre-Ardennes, and Champagne, and near the Ardennes Massif (dense woodland). It is not far from Charleville-M\u00E9zi\u00E8res, Sedan (the largest medieval castle in Europe), Rocroi, Reims (where the kings of France were crowned), Ch\u00E2lons-en-Champagne, and Varennes-en-Argonne (where Louis XVI was arrested during the French Revolution). On 1 June 2016, the former communes Terron-sur-Aisne and Vrizy were merged into Vouziers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_Open","surface_form":"Roland Garros","offset":184},{"uri":"French_Open","surface_form":"French Open","offset":228},{"uri":"Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1_Garrigue_Masaryk","surface_form":"Tom\u00E1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk","offset":269},{"uri":"Czechoslovak_Legion","surface_form":"Czechoslovak Legion","offset":360},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":402},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":506},{"uri":"Jean_Witkowski","surface_form":"Jean Witkowski","offset":516},{"uri":"Solar_eclipse","surface_form":"solar eclipse","offset":600},{"uri":"Observation","surface_form":"observation","offset":652},{"uri":"Traffic_congestion","surface_form":"gridlocked","offset":726},{"uri":"Aisne_(river)","surface_form":"Aisne","offset":829},{"uri":"Canal_des_Ardennes","surface_form":"canal des Ardennes","offset":887},{"uri":"Forest_of_Argonne","surface_form":"Forest of Argonne","offset":934},{"uri":"Pre-Ardennes","surface_form":"pre-Ardennes","offset":957},{"uri":"Champagne_(province)","surface_form":"Champagne","offset":975},{"uri":"Ardennes","surface_form":"Ardennes Massif","offset":999},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"woodland","offset":1022},{"uri":"Charleville-M%C3%A9zi%C3%A8res","surface_form":"Charleville-M\u00E9zi\u00E8res","offset":1052},{"uri":"Sedan%2C_France","surface_form":"Sedan","offset":1074},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1112},{"uri":"Rocroi","surface_form":"Rocroi","offset":1121},{"uri":"Reims","surface_form":"Reims","offset":1129},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2lons-en-Champagne","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2lons-en-Champagne","offset":1177},{"uri":"Varennes-en-Argonne","surface_form":"Varennes-en-Argonne","offset":1203},{"uri":"Louis_XVI","surface_form":"Louis XVI","offset":1230},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":1264},{"uri":"Terron-sur-Aisne","surface_form":"Terron-sur-Aisne","offset":1320},{"uri":"Vrizy","surface_form":"Vrizy","offset":1341}]}
