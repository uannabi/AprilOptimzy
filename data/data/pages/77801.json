{"id":77801,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambled_eggs","text":"Scrambled eggs is a dish made from beaten whites and yolks of eggs (usually chicken). The dish often contains other ingredients. Cream, butter, milk, water or oil (used in China) will dilute the egg proteins to create a softer texture.\nSample recipe.\nThe eggs and a large piece of butter are put into a saucepan over a low heat. The egg whites and egg yolks are then \"scrambled\" or mixed together. The mixture should be mixed together all the time they are being cooked.\nWhen cooked a little cr\u00E9me fr\u00E2iche is added. This is because the eggs will be hot enough to carry on cooking themselves. Adding a cool liquid will stop the eggs from overcooking. Some salt and pepper or other seasoning can be added to taste as well.\nIn the home the eggs can be mixed together first and then poured into a pan. The cr\u00E9me fr\u00E2iche does not need to be added if the eggs will be eaten almost immediately.\nProperly made, the eggs should be moist and creamy consistency. If any liquid is coming from the eggs, it means the eggs have been overcooked or that the add the vegetables were undercooked.\nOther methods of preparation.\nUsing a double boiler or \"bain-marie\" means that the heat is constant, and does not to be adjusted to make sure the eggs do not brown or burn. The baine marie method is slower than cooking directly in a pan over a heat but makes it easier to cook the eggs perfectly. The eggs must be taken out of the bain marie when cooked, otherwise they will carry on cooking and spoil.\nScrambled eggs may also be made in a microwave oven by put the ingredients in a glass bowl and cooking for 30 seconds then whisking, then cooking and whisking again until the desired consistency is achieved.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Egg_white","surface_form":"whites","offset":42},{"uri":"Egg_yolk","surface_form":"yolks","offset":53},{"uri":"Egg_(food)","surface_form":"eggs","offset":62},{"uri":"Chicken","surface_form":"chicken","offset":76},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":172},{"uri":"Edible_salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":655},{"uri":"Black_pepper","surface_form":"pepper","offset":664},{"uri":"Seasoning","surface_form":"seasoning","offset":680},{"uri":"Vegetable","surface_form":"vegetable","offset":1050},{"uri":"Bain-marie","surface_form":"bain-marie","offset":1135},{"uri":"Microwave_oven","surface_form":"microwave oven","offset":1519}]}
