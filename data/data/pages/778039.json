It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a tropical wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in USD. Potential tropical cyclones are not included in this table.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["hurricane season","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small","hurricane small"],"annotations":[{"uri":"2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2005","offset":133},{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic","surface_form":"COVID-19 pandemic","offset":346},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":527},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":554},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":563},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":583},{"uri":"The_Bahamas","surface_form":"The Bahamas","offset":610},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":626},{"uri":"The_Bahamas","surface_form":"The Bahamas","offset":833},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"Southern United States","offset":849},{"uri":"Crew_Dragon_Demo-2","surface_form":"Crew Dragon Demo-2","offset":892},{"uri":"Bay_of_Campeche","surface_form":"Bay of Campeche","offset":1123},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1151},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":1187},{"uri":"Wisconsin","surface_form":"Wisconsin","offset":1228},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":1873},{"uri":"Guyana","surface_form":"Guyana","offset":2003},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":2060},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":2274},{"uri":"Pandemic","surface_form":"pandemic","offset":2321},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":2409},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2457},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":2491},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":2682},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":2790},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":3111},{"uri":"Hurricane_Katrina","surface_form":"Hurricane Katrina","offset":3243},{"uri":"Leeward_Islands","surface_form":"Leeward Islands","offset":3584},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":3618},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":3663},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":3791},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":3840},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":4113},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":4221},{"uri":"Newfoundland","surface_form":"Newfoundland","offset":5326},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":6344},{"uri":"Carribean_Sea","surface_form":"Carribean Sea","offset":6391},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":6940},{"uri":"Tropical_wave","surface_form":"tropical wave","offset":6957}]}
