{"id":778209,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tino_rangatiratanga","text":"\"Tino rangatiratanga\" is a M\u0101ori language term that means \"absolute sovereignty.\" Sovereignty means absolute power to rule something without someone else interfering. In this case, it refers to the ability of the M\u0101ori people (the indigenous people of New Zealand) to rule themselves and be recognized as the owners of the land. \"Tino rangatiratanga\" shows up in the M\u0101ori version of the Treaty of Waitangi, which they signed with the British in 1840. They were promised that they would have \"tino rangatiratanga\" forever in the treaty. However, this concept was not respected since the British colonizers took a lot of things from the M\u0101ori people. To this day, people in New Zealand do not agree on what \"tino rangatiratanga\" means or what kind of things it is supposed to cover.\nOrigin.\nA \"rangatira\" is a chief in the M\u0101ori culture. The suffix -tanga is added so \"rangatiratanga\" refers to the qualities of being a chief. \"Tino\" is a M\u0101ori word that means \"most\" or \"absolute.\" So by using this term, the British were allowing Maori chiefs to have complete control and allow them to use their powers as chiefs.\nSome people think that the term can be used to describe self-determination, autonomy, or M\u0101ori independence.\nTreaty.\nThere is a lot of confusion about the Treaty of Waitangi because Articles 1 and 2 in the treaty say different things.\nAccording to the M\u0101ori version of the treaty, Article 1 is talking about \"kawanatanga\" (governorship) while Article 2 is talking about \"tino rangatiratanga\" (absolute chieftainship). To them, these are two totally different concepts. Therefore, they believe that they never gave away their land rights and ability to rule themselves. In fact, a tribunal that was created to focus on the Treaty of Waitangi said that the M\u0101ori can never give up those rights and never did..\nFlag.\nThere is a Tino rangatiratanga flag that is used to represent the M\u0101ori people. It is red, white, and black. It was designed by M\u0101ori artists Hiraina Marsden, Jan Smith and Linda Munn in 1990 as part of a contest.\nA woman named Poua Erstich came up with the meaning for the flag. The red represents the sky, the black is earth, and the white is light separating the sky and earth. The flag is supposed to show the M\u0101ori story of how the world was created.\nThis flag is flown next to the flag of New Zealand to show people that the land still belongs to the M\u0101ori. Sometimes, this flag is used in protests to show how certain issues are affecting M\u0101ori.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_language","surface_form":"M\u0101ori language","offset":27},{"uri":"Sovereignty","surface_form":"sovereignty","offset":68},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":252},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Waitangi","surface_form":"Treaty of Waitangi","offset":388},{"uri":"Self-determination","surface_form":"self-determination","offset":1171},{"uri":"Autonomy","surface_form":"autonomy","offset":1191}]}
