{"id":778315,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_insurrection_of_1898","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Wilmington insurrection of 1898, also known as the Wilmington massacre of 1898 or the Wilmington coup of 1898, happened in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Thursday, November 10, 1898.\nIt is seen as a turning point in post-Reconstruction North Carolina politics. It caused more intense racial segregation of African Americans throughout the South. It made it harder for African-Americans to vote.\nThe event was caused after many white supremacists took over the Wilmington city government which was controlled by both white and black men and killed the black alderman. After the event, no black politician was in charge in Wilmington.\nIt has been called a race riot caused by blacks by white newspapers at the time. However, over time, with more facts publicized, the event has come to be seen as a \"coup d'\u00E9tat\", the violent overthrow of a duly elected government, by a group of white supremacists. It is seen as the only coup in American history.\nThe \"coup\" happens with 2,000 white men. They destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed about 60 to more than 300 people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wilmington%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Wilmington, North Carolina","offset":140},{"uri":"Reconstruction_Era","surface_form":"Reconstruction","offset":238},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":253},{"uri":"Racial_segregation","surface_form":"racial segregation","offset":301},{"uri":"African_Americans","surface_form":"African Americans","offset":323},{"uri":"Supremacy","surface_form":"supremacists","offset":450},{"uri":"Riot","surface_form":"race riot","offset":671},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"blacks","offset":691},{"uri":"Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","surface_form":"coup d'\u00E9tat","offset":815},{"uri":"American_history","surface_form":"American history","offset":946},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"Civil War","offset":1085}]}
