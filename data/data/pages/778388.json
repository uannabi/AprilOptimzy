Azerbaijani writer and philosopher Mirza Fatali Akhundov explained the rules of chess in his 1864 poem \"The Game of Shatranj\".\nAzerbaijan as a member of the USSR.\nOrganized chess began in Azerbaijan shortly after the creation of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic in 1920, and the game soon became widespread. The first chess column appeared in the newspaper \"Bakinsky Rabochy\" in the early 1920s. In 1923 the first Baku championship took place.\nOn May 2\u20133, 1929, a match between teams from Baku and Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, was held on 8 boards in Baku.\nIn 1934 the first Azerbaijani Championship took place.

Polisskaya of Baku became women's champion of the South Caucasus. In 1938, a women's chess school was opened at the Baku Chess and Checkers Club.\nHowever, these chess championships at the local and national level were not held every year and the World War II, disrupted the chess tournaments and activities. But since 1947 chess championships have been held every year.\nModern times.\nAfter Azerbaijan gained its independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Azerbaijani chess players have achieved high results in various international competitions, World and European championships.
