It goes between Chester, England and Holyhead, Wales. It goes along the north coast of Wales for most of its route. For most of the route, it is a dual carriageway. Many parts of the road act like a motorway.\nIt is also part of the European route E22, which links to Amsterdam, Riga, and Moscow. The route once went between Bangor and Chester, but was extended to Holyhead in 2001. This links to the Republic of Ireland through the Port of Holyhead.
