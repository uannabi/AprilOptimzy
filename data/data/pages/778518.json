Old writings from ancient Greece talk about orichalcum and the Romans made coins out of a metal they called orichalcum, but they might not have been the same metal. People today are not sure exactly what it was. Some scholars think orichalcum was the ancient Greek name for platinum. Others think it was an alloy, or mixture, of copper and either gold, tin, or zinc. Scientists examined Roman coins and found a mixture of copper and zinc.\nName.\nThe name \"orichalcum\" is from the Greek word for \"mountain copper\" or \"mountain metal.\"\nSome people think name \"aurichalcum\" comes from the word \"aurum\" for \"gold,\" but it does not.\nGreek orichalcum.\nIn general, when ancient Greek writers wrote about orichalcum, they said it was a metal that looked like gold but that they did not know much else about it. To Homer, Hesiod and Plato, orichalcum was a metal from much earlier times that did not exist in their own time and place.\nIn one of the Homeric Hymns, Homer writes about orichalcum earrings. Hesiod writes about orichalcum greaves, which are leg armor. Neither writer was talking about his own time and place.\nPlato wrote about orichalcum in his book \"Critias\". In the book, Plato says orichalchum was in the ground of the legendary island of Atlantis. To the Atlanteans, it was the second-most-valuable metal, after gold. Plato says the Atlanteans put orichalcum on their city walls and temples. Plato calls orichalcum \"only a name\" in his own time, meaning he did not think he had ever seen orichalcum.\nRoman orichalcum.\nThe ancient Romans also had a metal that they called orichalcum. Around the time the Roman Republic ended and the Roman Empire started, the Romans stopped making coins out of bronze and started making them out of orichalcum: asses coins, sestertii coins, dupondii coins and semisses coins.\nRoman orichalcum does corrode over time, the way iron rusts and silver tarnishes.\nMaking orichalcum.\nScientists analyzed Roman coins and saw they were made of copper and zinc. During the early days of the Roman Empire, Romans invented a better way to make zinc-copper alloys. This way is called cementation. To do it, the metalworker has to heat the zinc and copper to exactly the correct temperature. Then there can be as much as 30% zinc in the orichalcum.\nIn fiction.\nOrichalcum appears in many works of fiction, especially stories about Atlantis. It is in television shows, for example \"The Mysterious Cities of Gold\" and '. It is in video games, for example \"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness\" and \"Elder Scrolls\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metal","offset":55},{"uri":"Platinum","surface_form":"platinum","offset":360},{"uri":"Alloy","surface_form":"alloy","offset":393},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":415},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":433},{"uri":"Tin","surface_form":"tin","offset":439},{"uri":"Zinc","surface_form":"zinc","offset":447},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":565},{"uri":"Homeric_Hymns","surface_form":"Homeric Hymns","offset":1025},{"uri":"Homer","surface_form":"Homer","offset":1040},{"uri":"Hesiod","surface_form":"Hesiod","offset":1080},{"uri":"Greaves","surface_form":"greaves","offset":1111},{"uri":"Plato","surface_form":"Plato","offset":1198},{"uri":"Critias","surface_form":"Critias","offset":1240},{"uri":"Atlantis","surface_form":"Atlantis","offset":1331},{"uri":"Roman_Republic","surface_form":"Roman Republic","offset":1696},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":1725},{"uri":"Bronze","surface_form":"bronze","offset":1786},{"uri":"Corrosion","surface_form":"corrode","offset":1923},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":2106},{"uri":"The_Mysterious_Cities_of_Gold","surface_form":"The Mysterious Cities of Gold","offset":2492},{"uri":"Castlevania","surface_form":"Castlevania","offset":2565},{"uri":"Elder_Scrolls","surface_form":"Elder Scrolls","offset":2602}]}
