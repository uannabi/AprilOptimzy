{"id":778695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Coleman","text":"e=\"preserve\">Catherine Daisy Coleman (March 30, 1997 \u2013 August 4, 2020) was an American women's rights activist. Her experience of sexual assault at the age of 14 was featured in the 2016 documentary movie \"Audrie & Daisy\".\nColeman co-founded the nonprofit organization, SafeBAE aimed at preventing sexual assault in schools.\nIn January 2012, Matthew Barnett, 17, was arrested for the rape and sexual assault of Coleman, a 14-year-old girl. However, the case was dropped by the county prosecutor. Many believe it was dropped because Barnett's grandfather was state representative Rex Barnett.\nColeman died by suicide on August 4, 2020 at the age of 23.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Women%27s_rights","surface_form":"women's rights","offset":87},{"uri":"Sexual_assault","surface_form":"sexual assault","offset":130},{"uri":"Audrie_%26amp%3B_Daisy","surface_form":"Audrie & Daisy","offset":206},{"uri":"Sexual_assault","surface_form":"sexual assault","offset":393},{"uri":"Rex_Barnett","surface_form":"Rex Barnett","offset":579}]}
