There are 57 episodes. It was made into 8 series or seasons. The programme revolves around the intergenerational relationship between a rag and bone father and son.\nStory.\nThe father, set in his grimy ways, and often described by his son as a 'dirty old man', is the opposite in character to his son, who is aspirational but pretentious. Harold, played by Harry H. Corbett, the younger man of the two, has ideas of bettering himself but his dreams are often ridiculed or dashed by his dependent father, Albert, played by Wilfrid Brambell..\nThe show has its roots in a 1962 episode of Galton and Simpson's \"Comedy Playhouse\". Ray Galton and Alan Simpson went on to write all episodes of the series and two films based on the series, \"Stepson and Son (1972)\" and its sequel\", Steptoe and Son Rides Again (1973).\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Harry_H_Corbett","surface_form":"Harry H.
