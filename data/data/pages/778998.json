{"id":778998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohala","text":"Kohala is an extinct shield volcano in Hawaii. It is the oldest of five volcanoes on the Big Island, forming its northwestern part.\nHistory.\nAround a million years ago, Kohala started erupting. Its last eruption was 120,000 years ago, meaning it's likely extinct. The other volcanoes on the Big Island are either active or dormant. 250,000 to 300,000 years ago, a massive landslide destroyed much of the mountain.\nKamehameha I, the first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born near Kohala in 1758.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shield_volcano","surface_form":"shield volcano","offset":21},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":39},{"uri":"Hawaii_(island)","surface_form":"Big Island","offset":89},{"uri":"Kamehameha_I","surface_form":"Kamehameha I","offset":414},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"Kingdom of Hawaii","offset":451}]}
