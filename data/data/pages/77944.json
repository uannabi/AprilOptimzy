He is often called \"Diego de Vel\u00E1zquez\" by Dominican historians (that is the name used in the [http://famousamericans.net/diegodevelazquez/ Appleton's Cyclopedia]).\nHe was born in Cu\u00E9llar, near Segovia, Spain. He came to America in the second voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1493. He spent 17 years in the Hispaniola, living most of the time in the southwestern region of the island.\nHe worked together with the Spanish governor Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando in the fight against the Ta\u00EDno Indians of the region. He founded and governed several towns: Azua de Compostela (1504), San Juan de la Maguana (1503), B\u00E1nica (1504), Salvatierra de la Sabana (1504, now Les Cayes, Haiti), Santa Mar\u00EDa de la Verapaz (near the present Port-au-Prince, Haiti), Villanueva de Y\u00E1quimo (now Jacmel, Haiti).\nIn 1511, he left from Salvatierra de la Sabana with 300 men and three or four ships to the island of Cuba to conquer that island. He was the first governor of the island and he founded several cities, Nuestra Se\u00F1ora de la Asunci\u00F3n de Baracoa (the first European city in Cuba and its first capital) in 1511, San Salvador del Bayamo (1513), Santiago de Cuba in 1514 and Havana in 1515.\nIn 1517 he sent Juan de Grijalva to explore the coast of Mexico and in 1518 he sent Francisco Hern\u00E1ndez de C\u00F3rdoba to explore the coast of Yucat\u00E1n. Then in 1519 he sent his secretary, Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s, to conquer Mexico with about 450 soldiers but when Cort\u00E9s got to M\u00E9xico (in Veracruz), he broke all relations with Vel\u00E1zquez.\nDiego Vel\u00E1zquez de Cu\u00E9llar died in Santiago de Cuba in 1524.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez","surface_form":"Diego Vel\u00E1zquez","offset":44},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":109},{"uri":"Conquistador","surface_form":"Conquistador","offset":156},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":197},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":206},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican","offset":256},{"uri":"Segovia","surface_form":"Segovia","offset":407},{"uri":"Americas","surface_form":"America","offset":434},{"uri":"Christopher_Columbus","surface_form":"Christopher Columbus","offset":466},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":521},{"uri":"Nicol%C3%A1s_de_Ovando","surface_form":"Nicol\u00E1s de Ovando","offset":644},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":687},{"uri":"B%C3%A1nica%2C_El%C3%ADas_Pi%C3%B1a","surface_form":"B\u00E1nica","offset":813},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":1095},{"uri":"Baracoa","surface_form":"Nuestra Se\u00F1ora de la Asunci\u00F3n de Baracoa","offset":1195},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1247},{"uri":"Havana","surface_form":"Havana","offset":1362},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1435},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n","offset":1517},{"uri":"Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s","surface_form":"Hern\u00E1n Cort\u00E9s","offset":1562},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1588},{"uri":"Santiago_de_Cuba","surface_form":"Santiago de Cuba","offset":1738}]}
