{"id":779759,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodrell_Bank_Observatory","text":"The Jodrell Bank Observatory a radio telescope in Cheshire. It picks up radio waves from outer space. Jodrell Bank is mainly used for investigating radio waves from the planets and stars.\nIt was the idea of its first director, Bernard Lovell, to use radio signals to investigate cosmic rays. Lovell, Professor of Astronomy at Manchester University, had worked on radar in World War II. The observatory was set up in 1945.\nIt has been used to research meteoroids, quasars, pulsars, masers and gravitational lenses. It was heavily involved in tracking space probes.\nThe main telescope at the observatory is the Lovell Telescope. It has diameter of, and is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory.\nThe Jodrell Bank Observatory is the base of the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), a \"National Facility\" run by the University of Manchester. What this means is that radio telescopes can work together to form a long baseline to better collect data from an important phenomenon. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the Mark II, and and 7\u00A0m diameter radio telescopes.\nThe telescope discovered radio noise from the Great Nebula in Andromeda\u2014the first definite detection of an extragalactic radio source\u2014and the remains of Tycho's Supernova in the radio frequency. At that time, Tycho's Supervova had not been discovered by regular light telescopes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Radio_telescope","surface_form":"radio telescope","offset":31},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":50},{"uri":"Radio_wave","surface_form":"radio wave","offset":72},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":89},{"uri":"Bernard_Lovell","surface_form":"Bernard Lovell","offset":227},{"uri":"Radio_signal","surface_form":"radio signal","offset":250},{"uri":"Cosmic_rays","surface_form":"cosmic rays","offset":279},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"Astronomy","offset":313},{"uri":"Manchester_University","surface_form":"Manchester University","offset":326},{"uri":"Radar","surface_form":"radar","offset":363},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":372},{"uri":"Meteoroid","surface_form":"meteoroid","offset":451},{"uri":"Quasar","surface_form":"quasar","offset":463},{"uri":"Pulsar","surface_form":"pulsar","offset":472},{"uri":"Astrophysical_maser","surface_form":"masers","offset":481},{"uri":"Gravitational_lens","surface_form":"gravitational lens","offset":492},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"space probe","offset":550},{"uri":"MERLIN","surface_form":"Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network","offset":820},{"uri":"University_of_Manchester","surface_form":"University of Manchester","offset":913},{"uri":"Mark_II_(radio_telescope)","surface_form":"Mark II","offset":1139},{"uri":"Andromeda_Galaxy","surface_form":"Great Nebula","offset":1233},{"uri":"Andromeda_(constellation)","surface_form":"Andromeda","offset":1249},{"uri":"Tycho%27s_Supernova","surface_form":"Tycho's Supernova","offset":1340},{"uri":"Telescope","surface_form":"telescope","offset":1455}]}
