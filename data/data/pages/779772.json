The six sites includes the Pier Head, Albert Dock, William Brown Street, and other famous landmarks in the city. They are considered the 'the supreme example of a commercial port at a time of Britain's greatest global influence'.\nThe sites have been nominated to UNESCO in January 2003. By March 2004, ICOMOS recommended the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City as a World Heritage Site. It was accepted under cultural basis: ii, iii and iv.\nIn 2012, the proposed construction of Liverpool Waters project caused for the sites to be included in the List of World Heritage in Danger. In July 2017, UNESCO warned it may lose its status because of the development plans.\nThe English Heritage argued against the Liverpool Waters development. It believes that it may lead some of Liverpool's most significant historic buildings to be \u201Cseverely compromised\u201D.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":44},{"uri":"List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":51},{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":74},{"uri":"Pier_Head","surface_form":"Pier Head","offset":121},{"uri":"Royal_Albert_Dock%2C_Liverpool","surface_form":"Albert Dock","offset":132},{"uri":"William_Brown_Street","surface_form":"William Brown Street","offset":145},{"uri":"Landmarks","surface_form":"landmarks","offset":184},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"commercial","offset":257},{"uri":"Port","surface_form":"port","offset":268},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":459},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":502},{"uri":"Liverpool_Waters","surface_form":"Liverpool Waters","offset":572},{"uri":"List_of_World_Heritage_in_Danger","surface_form":"List of World Heritage in Danger","offset":640},{"uri":"English_Heritage","surface_form":"English Heritage","offset":763},{"uri":"Liverpool_Waters","surface_form":"Liverpool Waters","offset":799},{"uri":"Compromise","surface_form":"compromised","offset":930}]}
