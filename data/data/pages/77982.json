{"id":77982,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doner_kebab","text":"The doner kebab (or from Turkish \"D\u00F6ner kebab\", but seldom \"d\u00F6ner\") is a Turkish dish. A Doner can be made from lamb, chicken or beef. It is cooked on a vertical rotisserie then thinly sliced. When bought from kebab shops it usually comes with salad or french fries.\nTraditionally Turkish restaurants offer hot chili sauce and garlic yoghurt-style sauce. Barbecue sauce, burger sauce, lemon juice, or a mint sauce similar to raita are also popular.\nDoners are often eaten as take-away food on the way home after a night out. There are several common ways in which doner kebabs are served.\nAn equivalent dish to a doner kebab is called Iskender Kebab. Iskender is served steaming hot and the doner meat is covered in a tomato pur\u00E9e like sauce. Iskender is more of a delicacy which is served only in Turkish restaurants.\nIn the UK.\nKebabs are very much part of the Friday and Saturday night culture in the UK rather than breakfast or lunchtime food. UK \"doner kebab\" often uses a different mixture of spices, because immigrants from Northern Cyprus run many of the shops. They may offer doner, shish (lamb and chicken) and kofte kebabs, with a 'special' including some of each with bread and chips.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkish_language","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":25},{"uri":"Chili","surface_form":"chili","offset":311},{"uri":"Raita_(condiment)","surface_form":"raita","offset":425},{"uri":"Take-away","surface_form":"take-away","offset":475},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":889},{"uri":"Northern_Cyprus","surface_form":"Northern Cyprus","offset":1031},{"uri":"French_fries","surface_form":"chips","offset":1190}]}
