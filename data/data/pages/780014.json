{"id":780014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_(proposed_Pacific_state)","text":"The State of Jefferson is a proposed U.S. state that would span mostly rural area of southern Oregon and northern California.\nThis region on the Pacific Coast is the most famous of several that have sought to adopt the name of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States.\nThis region makes up most of Northern California's land but does not include San Francisco or other Bay Area counties that account for the majority of Northern California's population.\nIf the proposal were ever approved, the new state's capital city would have to be determined by a constitutional convention. Yreka, California, was named the provisional capital in the original 1941 proposal. Port Orford, Oregon and Redding, California are some other possible capital city ideas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":37},{"uri":"Rural","surface_form":"rural","offset":71},{"uri":"Oregon","surface_form":"southern Oregon","offset":85},{"uri":"Northern_California","surface_form":"northern California","offset":105},{"uri":"Pacific_Coast","surface_form":"Pacific Coast","offset":145},{"uri":"Thomas_Jefferson","surface_form":"Thomas Jefferson","offset":227},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":255},{"uri":"Yreka%2C_California","surface_form":"Yreka, California","offset":597},{"uri":"Port_Orford%2C_Oregon","surface_form":"Port Orford, Oregon","offset":681},{"uri":"Redding%2C_California","surface_form":"Redding, California","offset":705}]}
