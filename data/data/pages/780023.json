{"id":780023,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lambeth_(1212)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Treaty of Lambeth was signed on 4 May 1212 by King John of England and several French counts. The Treaty of Lambeth of 1212 should not be confused with the Treaty of Lambeth of 1217, also known as the Treaty of Kingston.\nBy 1212 John had lost his Angevin possessions in France. Renaud lands had also been seized by King Philip II of France. Renaud brought other continental nobles, including Ferdinand, into a coalition against Philip. In return he was given several fiefs in England and an annuity. In the treaty agreed on 4 May 1212, each prince promised not to make a separate peace with France.\nThis treaty was part of England's retreat from France, and the collecting of all France under the rule of its king. Previously, under the conquering English kings from Normandy, the Norman kings had ruled over large parts of what is now France.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_of_England","surface_form":"John of England","offset":68},{"uri":"Count","surface_form":"count","offset":103},{"uri":"Angevin_Empire","surface_form":"Angevin possessions","offset":264},{"uri":"Philip_II_of_France","surface_form":"Philip II of France","offset":337},{"uri":"Fief","surface_form":"fief","offset":484},{"uri":"Annuity","surface_form":"annuity","offset":508}]}
