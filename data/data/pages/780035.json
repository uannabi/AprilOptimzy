It lives in forests and wetlands not near the ocean.\nSome scientists, for example Paul Menzies, say this frog is closely related to Grant's big-eyed tree frog.\nThis frog was named after the scientist Richard George Zweifel. Zweifel described, or wrote the first formal papers about, many other frogs and wrote many studies about frogs and other amphibians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":55},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":70},{"uri":"Grant%27s_big-eyed_tree_frog","surface_form":"Grant's big-eyed tree frog","offset":220}]}
