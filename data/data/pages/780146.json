{"id":780146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creswell_Crags","text":"Creswell Crags is a limestone gorge on the border between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, England. It is near the villages of Creswell and Whitwell.\nThe cliffs in the ravine have several caves. The caves were occupied during the last ice age, between around 43,000 and 10,000 years ago. They have the northernmost cave art in Europe. The evidence of occupation is found in the rich series of sediments that accumulated over many thousands of years. It is internationally unique in showing how prehistoric people lived at the extreme northernmost limits of their territory in the later Pleistocene Ice Age.\nThe caves have layers with flint tools from the Mousterian, and later cultures. They were seasonally occupied by nomadic groups of people during the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. Evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman and post-medieval activity has also been found there. There is evidence of Neanderthal occupation 50,000\u201360,000 years ago, a brief Gravettian occupation around 32,000 years ago and use of all the main caves during the Magdalenian around 14,000 years ago. The site is open to the public and has a visitor centre with a small museum of objects.\nCreswell Crags has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It has also been put forward as a potential World Heritage Site.\nIn 2006\u201307, the B6042 road was re-routed from its path through the gorge, by approximately to the north, to minimise traffic impact on the site.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":20},{"uri":"Canyon","surface_form":"gorge","offset":30},{"uri":"Derbyshire","surface_form":"Derbyshire","offset":58},{"uri":"Nottinghamshire","surface_form":"Nottinghamshire","offset":73},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":90},{"uri":"Creswell%2C_Derbyshire","surface_form":"Creswell","offset":126},{"uri":"Whitwell%2C_Derbyshire","surface_form":"Whitwell","offset":139},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliff","offset":153},{"uri":"Ravine","surface_form":"ravine","offset":167},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":187},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":234},{"uri":"Cave_art","surface_form":"cave art","offset":314},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":392},{"uri":"Pleistocene","surface_form":"Pleistocene","offset":585},{"uri":"Ice_Age","surface_form":"Ice Age","offset":597},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":633},{"uri":"Tools","surface_form":"tools","offset":639},{"uri":"Mousterian","surface_form":"Mousterian","offset":654},{"uri":"Nomad","surface_form":"nomad","offset":719},{"uri":"Palaeolithic","surface_form":"Palaeolithic","offset":761},{"uri":"Mesolithic","surface_form":"Mesolithic","offset":778},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":821},{"uri":"Roman_Britain","surface_form":"Roman","offset":833},{"uri":"Medieval","surface_form":"medieval","offset":848},{"uri":"Neanderthal","surface_form":"Neanderthal","offset":914},{"uri":"Gravettian","surface_form":"Gravettian","offset":970},{"uri":"Magdalenian","surface_form":"Magdalenian","offset":1057},{"uri":"Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest","surface_form":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","offset":1222},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":1310},{"uri":"B6042_road","surface_form":"B6042 road","offset":1347}]}
