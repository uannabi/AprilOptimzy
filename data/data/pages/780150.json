{"id":780150,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Island","text":"Gough Island (), historically known as Gon\u00E7alo \u00C1lvares, is a rugged volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a dependency of Tristan da Cunha. It is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands.\nIt is about south-east of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago (which includes Nightingale Island and Inaccessible Island), north-east from South Georgia Island, west from Cape Town. It is over from the nearest point of South America.\nNobody lives on Gough Island except for the workers of a weather station, which is usually six people. The South African National Antarctic Programme has maintained the island with British permission since 1956. It is one of the most remote places with a people always being there.\nName.\nThe island was first named \"Ilha de Gon\u00E7alo \u00C1lvares\" on Portuguese maps. It was named Gough Island after the British mariner Captain Charles Gough of the \"Richmond\", who first saw the island in 1732. Confusion of the unusual Portuguese saint name Gon\u00E7alo with Spanish Diego led to the wrong name Diego Alvarez Island in English-language sources from the 1800s to 1930s.\nHowever, the most likely explanation is that it was simply a misreading of 'Is de Go Alvarez', the name by which the island is represented on some of the early charts, the 'de Go' mutating into 'Diego'.\nHistory.\nThe details of the discovery of Gough Island are unclear, but the most likely occasion is July 1505 by the Portuguese explorer Gon\u00E7alo \u00C1lvares. Maps during the next three centuries named the island after him. On some later maps, this was erroneously given as Diego Alvarez.\nAccording to some historians, the British merchant Anthony de la Roch\u00E9 was the first to land on the island in the austral autumn of 1675.\nCharles Gough rediscovered the island on 3 March 1732. He thought it was a new find. It had been named Gon\u00E7alo \u00C1lvares since 1505 after the captain of Vasco da Gama's flagship on his epic voyage to the east. It was under this name that it was marked with reasonable accuracy on the charts of the South Atlantic during the following 230 or so years.\nThen, in 1732, Captain Gough of the British ship \"Richmond\" reported the discovery of a new island. He placed it 400 miles to the east of Gon\u00E7alo \u00C1lvares. Fifty years later, cartographers realised that the two islands were the same. Despite the priority of the Portuguese discovery, and the greater accuracy of the position given by them, \"Gough's Island\" was the name adopted.\nIn the early 19th century, sealers briefly inhabited the island. The earliest known example is a sealing gang from the U.S. ship \"Rambler\" (Captain Joseph Bowditch) which remained on the island in the 1804\u20131805 season. The sealing era lasted from 1804 to 1910 during which 34 sealing vessels are known to have visited the island, one of which was lost offshore.\nThe Scottish National Antarctic Expedition on the \"Scotia\" made the first visit to the island by a scientific party on 21 April 1904, when William Speirs Bruce and others collected specimens. The Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition also stopped at the island in 1922.\nGough Island was formally claimed in 1938 for Britain, during a visit by HMS \"Milford\" of the Royal Navy. In 1995, the island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2004, the site was extended to include Inaccessible Island and renamed Gough and Inaccessible Islands.\nGough Island is the only place outside South America from which the solar eclipse of September 12, 2034, will be visible; the centre of the path of totality crosses over the island.\nGeography and geology.\nGough Island is roughly rectangular with a length of and a width of. It has an area of and rises to heights of over above sea level. Topographic features include the highest peak, Edinburgh Peak, Hags Tooth, Mount Rowett, Sea Elephant Bay, Quest Bay, and Hawkins Bay.\nIt includes small satellite islands and rocks such as Southwest Island, Saddle Island (South), Tristiana Rock, Isolda Rock (West), Round Island, Cone Island, Lot's Wife, Church Rock (North), Penguin Island (Northeast), and The Admirals (East).\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00F6ppen system, Gough Island features an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\"). Gough Island's temperatures are between and during the day year-round, due to its isolated position far out in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic is much cooler in the southern hemisphere than the northern, but frosts are still very rare. As a result, summers are not very hot. It features a similar climate to the Fiordland area of New Zealand, the west coast of Scotland, or the Alaskan Panhandle. Precipitation is high during the entire year, and sunshine hours are few. Snow falls in the interior, but is rare at sea level.\nWeather station.\nA weather station has been running on Gough Island since 1956. It is operated as part of the network of the South African Weather Service. Because cold fronts approach South Africa from the south-west, the Gough station is particularly important in forecasting winter weather. Initially it was housed in the station at The Glen, but moved in 1963 to the South lowlands of the island, more precisely. The new location improved the validity and reliability of the data acquired for use in modeling.\nHuman presence.\nEach year a new overwintering team arrives by ship from Cape Town (beginning in 2012, the \"S. A. Agulhas II\") to staff the weather station and perform scientific research. The team for a particular year may be termed as \"Gough\" and an expedition number: for example, the 1956 team were \"Gough 01\", and the team for 2013 were \"Gough 58\". Each new team directly replaces the departing one, thereby maintaining a continual human presence on the island.\nThe team is supplied with enough food to last the whole year. People and cargo are landed either by helicopter, from a helideck-equipped supply ship, or by a fixed crane atop a cliff near the station (a place aptly called \"Crane Point\").\nIn 2014 a member of the research team choked to death on the island and his body was taken back to South Africa.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["islands|name=Gough Island &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;Gon\u00E7alo \u00C1lvares&lt;/small&gt;|highest_mount=[[Edinburgh Peak]]|footnotes=|country_admin_divisions=[[St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]]|country=United Kingdom|coordinates={{coord|40|19|0|S|9|56|0|W|region:SH_type:isle_dim:50000|display=inline,title}}|archipelago=[[Tristan da Cunha]]|location=[[South Atlantic Ocean]]|elevation_m=910|map=|width_km=7|length_km=13|area_km2=91|image_alt=View of Gough Island|image_caption=View of Gough Island|image_name=[[File:Gough island top view.png|300px]]|module={{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcanic_island","surface_form":"volcanic island","offset":68},{"uri":"Tristan_da_Cunha","surface_form":"Tristan da Cunha","offset":135},{"uri":"British_overseas_territories","surface_form":"British overseas territory","offset":171},{"uri":"Saint_Helena%2C_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha","surface_form":"Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha","offset":201},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":265},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":272},{"uri":"Inaccessible_Island","surface_form":"Inaccessible Islands","offset":305},{"uri":"Nightingale_Island","surface_form":"Nightingale Island","offset":402},{"uri":"Inaccessible_Island","surface_form":"Inaccessible Island","offset":425},{"uri":"South_Georgia_Island","surface_form":"South Georgia Island","offset":463},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":495},{"uri":"Weather_station","surface_form":"weather station","offset":615},{"uri":"South_African_National_Antarctic_Programme","surface_form":"South African National Antarctic Programme","offset":665},{"uri":"Gough-Calthorpe_family","surface_form":"Charles Gough","offset":979},{"uri":"Gon%C3%A7alo_de_Amarante","surface_form":"Gon\u00E7alo","offset":1093},{"uri":"Gon%C3%A7alo_%C3%81lvares","surface_form":"Gon\u00E7alo \u00C1lvares","offset":1555},{"uri":"Anthony_de_la_Roch%C3%A9","surface_form":"Anthony de la Roch\u00E9","offset":1753},{"uri":"Gough-Calthorpe_family","surface_form":"Charles Gough","offset":1840},{"uri":"Vasco_da_Gama","surface_form":"Vasco da Gama","offset":1991},{"uri":"Cartography","surface_form":"cartographers","offset":2363},{"uri":"Scottish_National_Antarctic_Expedition","surface_form":"Scottish National Antarctic Expedition","offset":2933},{"uri":"Scotia_(barque)","surface_form":"Scotia","offset":2980},{"uri":"William_Speirs_Bruce","surface_form":"William Speirs Bruce","offset":3068},{"uri":"Shackleton%E2%80%93Rowett_Expedition","surface_form":"Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition","offset":3125},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":3335},{"uri":"World_Heritage_Site","surface_form":"World Heritage Site","offset":3342},{"uri":"Inaccessible_Island","surface_form":"Inaccessible Island","offset":3405},{"uri":"Gough_and_Inaccessible_Islands","surface_form":"Gough and Inaccessible Islands","offset":3437},{"uri":"Solar_eclipse_of_September_12%2C_2034","surface_form":"solar eclipse of September 12, 2034","offset":3537},{"uri":"Satellite_city","surface_form":"satellite","offset":3960},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen system","offset":4212},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":4252},{"uri":"Fiordland","surface_form":"Fiordland","offset":4590},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":4608},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":4639},{"uri":"Alaskan_Panhandle","surface_form":"Alaskan Panhandle","offset":4656},{"uri":"Weather_station","surface_form":"weather station","offset":4822},{"uri":"South_African_Weather_Service","surface_form":"South African Weather Service","offset":4928},{"uri":"Cold_front","surface_form":"cold fronts","offset":4967},{"uri":"Cape_Town","surface_form":"Cape Town","offset":5389},{"uri":"S._A._Agulhas_II","surface_form":"S.
