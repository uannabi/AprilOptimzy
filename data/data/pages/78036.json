He was very good in riding in the mountains. In Individual time trials he was one of the best cyclists at his time. He won the Tour de France in 1997. Jan Ullrich is the only German athlete who has won this event.\nBeginning.\nJan Ullrich started cycling early. When he was ten years old, he won his first race. After Germany's reunification he went to a club in Hamburg. In 1993, when Ullrich was 19 years old, he won the World Amateur Road Race championship in Oslo, Norway. In this year Lance Armstrong won the Professional World Race championchip. The year after, he became third in the Individual Time Race championchip. After this succes he became a professional member of the German Team \"Team-Telekom\".\nTour de France.\nJan Ullrich first rode the Tour de France in 1996. There he won a stage and became overall second, after his team mate Bjarne Riis. Some experts say, Jan Ullrich could have won the Tour the France that year, but he did not because he helped his team-mate over the Tour.\nIn 2007 Bjarne Riis said that he used drugs to win the 1996 Tour. In 1997 Jan Ullrich won the Tour the France, when he was 23 years old (fourth youngest winner of the Tour since 1947). During this year he won the Tour de Suisse, German-Tour and HEW-Cyclassics. At the end of the year, he was elected as the \"sports person of the year\" in Germany.\nDoping.\nMany of Jan Ullrichs Team-members said, he was taking drugs in the 90. In 2002 he tested positive for amphetamine. He said he took pills in a disco, without knowing that they were an illegal substance. He was suspended for 6 months. In 2006 Ullrich was suspected to be a client of Fuentes. In 2007 a DNA-test gave the evidence that he was one, and that he was planning to use the illegal blood doping. Ullrich denied using drugs for a long time. In 2013, Ullrich decided to tell the truth. He admitted he used illegal substances during his career.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2_December","surface_form":"2 December","offset":18},{"uri":"1973","surface_form":"1973","offset":29},{"uri":"Rostock","surface_form":"Rostock","offset":37},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":46},{"uri":"Cycling","surface_form":"bicycle rider","offset":75},{"uri":"Tour_de_France","surface_form":"Tour de France","offset":217},{"uri":"Tour_de_France_1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":235},{"uri":"German_reunification","surface_form":"Germany's reunification","offset":406},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":451},{"uri":"World_Amateur_Road_Race_championship","surface_form":"World Amateur Road Race championship","offset":511},{"uri":"Oslo","surface_form":"Oslo","offset":551},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":557},{"uri":"Lance_Armstrong","surface_form":"Lance Armstrong","offset":578},{"uri":"World_Race_championchip","surface_form":"World Race championchip","offset":615},{"uri":"Team_T-Mobile","surface_form":"\"Team-Telekom\"","offset":783},{"uri":"Tour_de_France_1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":860},{"uri":"Bjarne_Riis","surface_form":"Bjarne Riis","offset":934},{"uri":"Tour_de_Suisse","surface_form":"Tour de Suisse","offset":1298},{"uri":"German-Tour","surface_form":"German-Tour","offset":1314},{"uri":"HEW-Cyclassics","surface_form":"HEW-Cyclassics","offset":1330},{"uri":"Amphetamine","surface_form":"amphetamine","offset":1542},{"uri":"Fuentes","surface_form":"Fuentes","offset":1721},{"uri":"Blood_doping","surface_form":"blood doping","offset":1828}]}
