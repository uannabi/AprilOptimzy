{"id":78140,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wakefield","text":"The City of Wakefield is in West Yorkshire, England. As well as Wakefield there are five other medium-sized towns - Normanton, Pontefract, Featherstone, Castleford and Knottingley - and some smaller towns in the City area. Most people who live in those towns will tell other people that they live in those towns, instead of telling them that they live in Wakefield. The City of Wakefield has a population of about 320,000 people.\nThere is a mulberry tree in the exercise yard of the Wakefield Prison. It is believed that the prisoners made up the song \"Here we go round the mulberry bush\" as they walked around and around the tree.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"West_Yorkshire","surface_form":"West Yorkshire","offset":28},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":44},{"uri":"Wakefield","surface_form":"Wakefield","offset":64},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":108},{"uri":"Normanton","surface_form":"Normanton","offset":116},{"uri":"Pontefract","surface_form":"Pontefract","offset":127},{"uri":"Featherstone","surface_form":"Featherstone","offset":139},{"uri":"Castleford","surface_form":"Castleford","offset":153},{"uri":"Knottingley","surface_form":"Knottingley","offset":168},{"uri":"Mulberry","surface_form":"mulberry","offset":441},{"uri":"HM_Prison_Wakefield","surface_form":"Wakefield Prison","offset":483},{"uri":"Prisoner","surface_form":"prisoner","offset":525}]}
