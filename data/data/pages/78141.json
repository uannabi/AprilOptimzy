{"id":78141,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)","text":"Io is a moon of the planet Jupiter. It is Jupiter's third biggest moon with a diameter of 3642\u00A0km, being slightly bigger than Earth's moon. Io has about 400 active volcanos.\nIo is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. Volcanoes erupt massive volumes of silicate lava, sulphur and sulphur dioxide, constantly changing Io's appearance. This new basemap of Jupiter's moon Io was produced by combining the best images from both the Voyager 1 and Galileo Missions. Although the subjovian hemisphere of Io was poorly seen by Galileo, superbly detailed Voyager 1 images cover longitudes from 240 W to 40 W and the nearby southern latitudes.\nDue to the same tidal locking that makes the Moon have the same side always facing Earth, Io always has the same side facing Jupiter. Unlike most celestial bodies, Io is a prolate spheroid, pulled out of round by tidal stress from Jupiter\u2019s gravity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":8},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":27},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":78},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":126},{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active volcano","offset":157},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":279},{"uri":"Sulphur","surface_form":"sulphur","offset":285},{"uri":"Sulphur_dioxide","surface_form":"sulphur dioxide","offset":297},{"uri":"Tidal_locking","surface_form":"tidal locking","offset":667},{"uri":"Spheroid","surface_form":"spheroid","offset":831}]}
