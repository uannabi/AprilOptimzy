It was used from 1928 to 1940, when it was replaced with Cyrillic by a Soviet law.\nArabic.\nThere have been two Arabic alphabets used to write Tatar: \"\u0130ske iml\u00E2\" and \"Ya\u00F1a iml\u00E2\". \"\u0130ske iml\u00E2\" is the older of the two and was used until 1920, when it was changed to become \"Ya\u00F1a iml\u00E2\" and remained in use until it was replaced by the Latin \"Ya\u00F1alif\" alphabet. However, Tatars in China still use \"\u0130ske iml\u00E2\".\nSince 2012, it is possible for people and organizations to write to the Tatarstan government in either the Latin or Arabic scripts, but the government has to answer in Cyrillic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Turkic_language","surface_form":"Turkic language","offset":24},{"uri":"Tatars","surface_form":"Tatar people","offset":62},{"uri":"Tatarstan","surface_form":"Tatarstan","offset":124},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":137},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":200},{"uri":"%C3%84","surface_form":"\u00C4","offset":258},{"uri":"%C3%87","surface_form":"\u00C7","offset":267},{"uri":"%C4%9E","surface_form":"\u011E","offset":282},{"uri":"Dotted_and_dotless_I","surface_form":"I, \u0130","offset":288},{"uri":"%C3%8D","surface_form":"\u00CD","offset":294},{"uri":"%C3%91","surface_form":"\u00D1","offset":312},{"uri":"%C3%96","surface_form":"\u00D6","offset":318},{"uri":"%C5%9E","surface_form":"\u015E","offset":333},{"uri":"%C3%9C","surface_form":"\u00DC","offset":342},{"uri":"Soviet","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":491},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic alphabet","offset":531},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":795}]}
