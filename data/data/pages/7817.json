He became the seventh President of the United States of America. He was the first Democrat and is on the Twenty Dollar Bill. His nickname was \"Old Hickory\". He forced many Native Americans to leave their homeland so white people could live there, and many died. This was called the Trail of Tears.\nEarly life.\nAs a boy Andrew Jackson was a messenger for the Continental Army. The British caught him and mistreated him.\nHe was the first U.S. President who was not born into a rich family. He was not a rich man and did not have a college education. He moved to Tennessee and became a politician.\nMarriage.\nIn 1791, he fell in love with Rachel Donelson Robards. They went through a marriage ceremony. However, the marriage was not legal because she had not been granted a divorce from her first husband. Therefore, they married legally three years later. They had no children, but they adopted several. He became rich and owned a large plantation.\nPolitics.\nIn the 1790s Jackson was a member of the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, and the Supreme Court of Tennessee. In the 1800s he commanded the Tennessee Militia and fought Indians. During the War of 1812 he became a general and won the Battle of New Orleans which made him very famous. In 1823 he returned to the Senate.\nAndrew Jackson reorganized the Democratic Party and was its leader.\nIn 1828, he defeated John Quincy Adams in the Presidential Election of 1828, he became President on March 4, 1829, and four years later he was re-elected to a second term as President. In 1832 South Carolina declared secession from the United States. Jackson threatened war, and then compromised.\nIn January 1835, Jackson was almost assassinated when an unemployed painter wanted to shoot him but both his guns jammed. He is the first president to have had an attempted assassination.\nDuring his Presidency, he signed the Indian Removal Act which allowed the U.S. government to violently force the Native Americans to move from their land and go west. Many Native Americans were killed and the path they walked to get to the west was called the Trail of Tears.\nAndrew Jackson was against the national bank of the United States because he felt that banks and their banknotes were for rich and powerful people and did not serve the interests of the common man. The national bank expired during Jackson's Presidency. Jackson chose not to continue the bank.\nOn March 4, 1837, Andrew Jackson finished his second term. After that, Vice-President Martin Van Buren was elected President and continued many of the things Jackson did. Jackson was a big influence on other Democrats during the 1800s.\nLegacy.\nJackson's legacy among historians is mixed. Some have liked him because he was against aristocrats, bankers, businessmen, the British Empire, cities, and paper money, and in favor of ordinary country people. Some have disliked him for the same reasons and because he was in favor of war and slavery, and against Indians.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder | name=Andrew Jackson"],"annotations":[{"uri":"War_of_1812","surface_form":"War of 1812","offset":71},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States_of_America","surface_form":"President of the United States of America","offset":142},{"uri":"United_States_Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Democrat","offset":202},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"Twenty Dollar Bill","offset":225},{"uri":"Native_American","surface_form":"Native Americans","offset":292},{"uri":"White_people","surface_form":"white people","offset":336},{"uri":"Trail_of_Tears","surface_form":"Trail of Tears","offset":402},{"uri":"Continental_Army","surface_form":"Continental Army","offset":478},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":680},{"uri":"Rachel_Jackson","surface_form":"Rachel Donelson Robards","offset":755},{"uri":"Plantation","surface_form":"plantation","offset":1054},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":1117},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"United States Senate","offset":1161},{"uri":"Militia","surface_form":"Militia","offset":1259},{"uri":"War_of_1812","surface_form":"War of 1812","offset":1298},{"uri":"Battle_of_New_Orleans","surface_form":"Battle of New Orleans","offset":1342},{"uri":"Democratic_Party","surface_form":"Democratic Party","offset":1458},{"uri":"John_Quincy_Adams","surface_form":"John Quincy Adams","offset":1516},{"uri":"Secession","surface_form":"secession","offset":1712},{"uri":"Assassinated","surface_form":"assassinated","offset":1828},{"uri":"Attempted_murder","surface_form":"attempted assassination","offset":1955},{"uri":"Indian_Removal_Act","surface_form":"Indian Removal Act","offset":2017},{"uri":"Trail_of_Tears","surface_form":"Trail of Tears","offset":2240},{"uri":"National_bank","surface_form":"national bank","offset":2287},{"uri":"Banknote","surface_form":"banknote","offset":2359},{"uri":"Martin_Van_Buren","surface_form":"Martin Van Buren","offset":2635},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":2919}]}
