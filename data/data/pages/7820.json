Pillows are usually rectangular. Pillows are covered with a fabric sheet called a pillowcase. The pillowcase protects the pillow from getting dirty.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cushion","surface_form":"cushion","offset":19},{"uri":"Cloth","surface_form":"cloth","offset":132},{"uri":"Feather","surface_form":"feather","offset":203},{"uri":"Synthetic","surface_form":"synthetic","offset":227},{"uri":"Rectangle","surface_form":"rectangular","offset":291},{"uri":"Fabric","surface_form":"fabric","offset":331}]}
