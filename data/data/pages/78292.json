{"id":78292,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_B%C3%BCchner","text":"Karl Georg B\u00FCchner (17 October 1813 \u2013 19 February 1837) was a German dramatist and writer of prose. He was the brother of physician and philosopher Ludwig B\u00FCchner. Many people think that he might have become as important as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller if he had lived longer.\nHe was the son of a doctor and born in Goddelau near Darmstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt. B\u00FCchner went to a secondary school that focused on Latin, Greek and on modern languages (including French, Italian and English). But he was mainly interested in science and when he went to university he studied medicine in Strasbourg.\nIn 1828 he became interested in politics and joined a group which later on probably became the Gie\u00DFen and Darmstadt section of the \"Gesellschaft f\u00FCr Menschenrechte\" (Society for Human Rights). In Strasbourg, he studied not only medicine but French literature and political thought as well.\nWhile B\u00FCchner continued his studies in Gie\u00DFen he started a secret society which wanted revolutionary change. With the help of the Protestant theologian Friedrich Ludwig Weidig he published the leaflet \"Der Hessische Landbote\", a revolutionary text that criticized social problems in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The authorities charged them with treason and issued a warrant of apprehension. While Weidig was arrested, tortured and died imprisoned in Darmstadt, B\u00FCchner fled across the border to Strasbourg where he wrote most of his literary work and translated two plays by Victor Hugo, \"Lucr\u00E8ce Borgia\" and \"Marie Tudor\". Two years later, his dissertation, \"M\u00E9moire sur le Syst\u00E8me Nerveux du Barbeaux (Cyprinus barbus L.)\" was published in Paris and Strasbourg. The ideas of Fran\u00E7ois-No\u00EBl Babeuf and Claude Henri de Saint-Simon had an important influence on his work. In October 1836 he got a job at the University of Z\u00FCrich as a lecturer in anatomy and went back to Z\u00FCrich where he spent his final months writing and teaching until he died of typhus at the age of twenty-three.\nIn 1835, his first play, \"Dantons Tod\" (Danton's Death), about the French revolution, was published, followed by \"Lenz\". It is a novella based on the life of the Sturm und Drang poet Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz. In 1836 his second play, \"Leonce and Lena\" he describes the nobility. His unfinished and most famous play, \"Woyzeck\", was the first literary work in German whose main characters were members of the working class. Published after B\u00FCchner's death, it became the basis for Alban Berg's opera \"Wozzeck\" which was first performed in 1925.\nBy the 1870s, B\u00FCchner was nearly forgotten in Germany when Karl Emil Franzos edited his works; these later became a major influence on naturalism and expressionism. Arnold Zweig described \"Lenz\", B\u00FCchner's only work of prose, as the \"beginning of modern European prose\".\nTranslations.\nThere are many translations of the individual plays.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":62},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"dramatist","offset":69},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":83},{"uri":"Prose","surface_form":"prose","offset":93},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":122},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":136},{"uri":"Ludwig_B%C3%BCchner","surface_form":"Ludwig B\u00FCchner","offset":148},{"uri":"Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","surface_form":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","offset":224},{"uri":"Friedrich_Schiller","surface_form":"Friedrich Schiller","offset":255},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":318},{"uri":"Darmstadt","surface_form":"Darmstadt","offset":351},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Hesse","surface_form":"Hesse-Darmstadt","offset":362},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":430},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":437},{"uri":"Languages","surface_form":"languages","offset":457},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":478},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":486},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":498},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":540},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":590},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":602},{"uri":"1828","surface_form":"1828","offset":617},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":646},{"uri":"Gie%C3%9Fen","surface_form":"Gie\u00DFen","offset":709},{"uri":"Human_rights","surface_form":"Human Rights","offset":792},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":842},{"uri":"French_literature","surface_form":"French literature","offset":855},{"uri":"Gie%C3%9Fen","surface_form":"Gie\u00DFen","offset":943},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":1034},{"uri":"Theology","surface_form":"theologian","offset":1045},{"uri":"Friedrich_Ludwig_Weidig","surface_form":"Friedrich Ludwig Weidig","offset":1056},{"uri":"The_Hessian_Courier","surface_form":"Der Hessische Landbote","offset":1106},{"uri":"Revolution","surface_form":"revolution","offset":1133},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Hesse","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Hesse","offset":1191},{"uri":"Treason","surface_form":"treason","offset":1247},{"uri":"Warrant","surface_form":"warrant","offset":1268},{"uri":"Apprehension","surface_form":"apprehension","offset":1279},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":1397},{"uri":"Victor_Hugo","surface_form":"Victor Hugo","offset":1477},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":1644},{"uri":"Strasbourg","surface_form":"Strasbourg","offset":1654},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois-No%C3%ABl_Babeuf","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois-No\u00EBl Babeuf","offset":1679},{"uri":"Claude_Henri_de_Saint-Simon","surface_form":"Claude Henri de Saint-Simon","offset":1704},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":1749},{"uri":"University_of_Z%C3%BCrich","surface_form":"University of Z\u00FCrich","offset":1808},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomy","offset":1846},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich_City","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":1871},{"uri":"Typhus","surface_form":"typhus","offset":1948},{"uri":"1835","surface_form":"1835","offset":1986},{"uri":"Danton%27s_Death","surface_form":"Danton's Death","offset":2023},{"uri":"French_revolution","surface_form":"French revolution","offset":2050},{"uri":"Lenz_(fragment)","surface_form":"Lenz","offset":2097},{"uri":"Novella","surface_form":"novella","offset":2112},{"uri":"Sturm_und_Drang","surface_form":"Sturm und Drang","offset":2145},{"uri":"Jakob_Michael_Reinhold_Lenz","surface_form":"Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz","offset":2166},{"uri":"1836","surface_form":"1836","offset":2198},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"nobility","offset":2255},{"uri":"Woyzeck","surface_form":"Woyzeck","offset":2303},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":2393},{"uri":"Alban_Berg","surface_form":"Alban Berg","offset":2465},{"uri":"Wozzeck","surface_form":"Wozzeck","offset":2485},{"uri":"Karl_Emil_Franzos","surface_form":"Karl Emil Franzos","offset":2588},{"uri":"Naturalism_(literature)","surface_form":"naturalism","offset":2664},{"uri":"Expressionism","surface_form":"expressionism","offset":2679},{"uri":"Arnold_Zweig","surface_form":"Arnold Zweig","offset":2694}]}
