From 1842 to 1848 he studied physics, chemistry, botany, mineralogy, philosophy and medicine at the University of Giessen. In 1852 he became lecturer in medicine at the University of T\u00FCbingen, where he published his great work \"Kraft und Stoff: Empirisch-naturphilosophische Studien\" (Force and Matter: Empiricophilosophical Studies, 1855). In this work, he sought to demonstrate the indestructibility of matter and force. The extreme materialism of this work excited so much opposition that he was compelled to give up his post at T\u00FCbingen. He retired to Darmstadt, where he practiced as a physician and contributed regularly to pathological and physiological magazines.\nHe died at Darmstadt on 1 May 1899.\nLudwig B\u00FCchner was the brother of Georg B\u00FCchner, a famous playwright.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":75},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":82},{"uri":"Physiologist","surface_form":"physiologist","offset":95},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":112},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":157},{"uri":"Materialism","surface_form":"materialism","offset":181},{"uri":"Darmstadt","surface_form":"Darmstadt","offset":214},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":225},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":281},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":290},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botany","offset":301},{"uri":"Mineralogy","surface_form":"mineralogy","offset":309},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":321},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":336},{"uri":"Giessen","surface_form":"Giessen","offset":366},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":405},{"uri":"T%C3%BCbingen","surface_form":"T\u00FCbingen","offset":435},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":657},{"uri":"Force_(physics)","surface_form":"force","offset":668},{"uri":"Materialism","surface_form":"materialism","offset":687},{"uri":"Darmstadt","surface_form":"Darmstadt","offset":808},{"uri":"Georg_B%C3%BCchner","surface_form":"Georg B\u00FCchner","offset":994},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":1018}]}
