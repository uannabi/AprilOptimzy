{"id":78311,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Fortune","text":"e=\"preserve\">:\"For other uses, see Wheel of Fortune.\"\nThe \"Wheel of Fortune\", or \"Rota Fortunae\", is a concept in medieval and ancient philosophy and means the unpredictable nature of Fate. The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna, who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel - some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls.\nOrigins.\nThe concept developed in antiquity; it was used by Cicero. The Wheel originally belonged to the Roman goddess Fortuna, whose name seems to derive from \"Vortumna\", \"she who revolves the year\". Fortuna eventually became Christianized: the Roman philosopher Boethius (d. 524) was a major source for the medieval view of the Wheel, writing about it in his\"Consolatio Philosophiae\".\nCarmina Burana.\nThe Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the \"Carmina Burana\" (or \"Burana Codex\"), over one thousand poems and songs \u2014 often profane in content \u2014 written by students and clergy in the early 13th century. Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, \"Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi\" (Fortune, Empress of the World)\" and \"Fortune Plango Vulnera\" (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune),\" read:The concept developed in antiquity; it was used by Cicero.

She is often associated with gamblers, and dice could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wheel_of_Fortune","surface_form":"Wheel of Fortune","offset":35},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":135},{"uri":"Fate","surface_form":"Fate","offset":184},{"uri":"Fortuna_(mythology)","surface_form":"Fortuna","offset":223},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"antiquity","offset":390},{"uri":"Cicero","surface_form":"Cicero","offset":416},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":602},{"uri":"Boethius","surface_form":"Boethius","offset":620},{"uri":"524","surface_form":"524","offset":633},{"uri":"Consolation_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Consolatio Philosophiae","offset":717},{"uri":"Carmina_Burana","surface_form":"Carmina Burana","offset":816},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"antiquity","offset":1186},{"uri":"Cicero","surface_form":"Cicero","offset":1212},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":1398},{"uri":"Boethius","surface_form":"Boethius","offset":1416},{"uri":"524","surface_form":"524","offset":1429},{"uri":"Consolation_of_Philosophy","surface_form":"Consolatio Philosophiae","offset":1513},{"uri":"Carl_Orff","surface_form":"Carl Orff","offset":1766},{"uri":"Carmina_Burana_(Orff)","surface_form":"O Fortuna","offset":1809},{"uri":"Gambler","surface_form":"gambler","offset":1954},{"uri":"Dice","surface_form":"dice","offset":1968},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":2034}]}
