{"id":783267,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crevasse","text":"A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an ice sheet or glacier. It is like a crevice that forms in rock. Crevasses form as a result of the movement caused by the shear stress between two semi-rigid pieces of ice.\nCrevasses often have vertical or near-vertical walls, which can then melt and create seracs, arches, and other ice formations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ice_sheet","surface_form":"ice sheet","offset":53},{"uri":"Glacier","surface_form":"glacier","offset":66},{"uri":"Fracture_(geology)","surface_form":"crevice","offset":88},{"uri":"Shear_stress","surface_form":"shear stress","offset":173},{"uri":"Serac","surface_form":"serac","offset":309},{"uri":"Arch","surface_form":"arch","offset":317}]}
