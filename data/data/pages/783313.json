{"id":783313,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing","text":"Ray tracing is a computer algorithm for drawing very realistic 3D images.\nWith ray tracing, objects in the scene are described with geometrical shapes like spheres or planes. The computer then sends rays (straight lines) forward from where the camera is. The objects that get hit by these rays are the objects that the camera can see. The computer then draws these objects. This is similar to how our eyes see, but in the real world the rays (light) go the opposite way \u2013 from the world to our eyes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Algorithm","surface_form":"algorithm","offset":26},{"uri":"Computer_graphics","surface_form":"3D images","offset":63}]}
