The city is considered as one of the most important archaeological sites in Albania. With its vast cultural, historical and natural value with a considerable history, Butrint became part of UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992. It became a National Park in 2000.\nButhrotum was a city of the Epirote tribe of the Chaonians. It started declining in Late Antiquity. It later became abandoned during the Middle Ages after a major earthquake flooded most of the city.\nIt is now an archeological site in Vlor\u00EB County, Albania. It is about 14\u00A0kilometres south of Sarand\u00EB and close to the Greek border. It is located on a hill overlooking the Vivari Channel, and is part of the Butrint National Park.\nDirections.\nThe site of Butrint is accessible from Sarand\u00EB. Its road was first built in 1959 for a visit by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. The road was improved during the summer of 2010.\nThe construction was somewhat of an environmental disaster. It one point, it threatened Butrint's World Heritage Site status. The ancient city is becoming a popular tourist destination. It attracts day-trippers from the nearby Greek holiday island of Corfu. Hydrofoils (30\u00A0minutes) and ferries (90\u00A0minutes) run daily between the New Port in Corfu Town and Saranda.\nMany visitors from Corfu use chartered coach services to visit Butrint from Sarand\u00EB. A regular public bus service runs between Sarand\u00EB port and Butrint. Others arrive from the Qafe Bote border crossing with Greece near Konispol and cross the Vivari Channel by the cable ferry at Butrint.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ancient_Greece","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":37},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman","offset":61},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishopric","offset":76},{"uri":"Epirus","surface_form":"Epirus","offset":89},{"uri":"Archaeological_site","surface_form":"archaeological sites","offset":149},{"uri":"Albania","surface_form":"Albania","offset":173},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":196},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"historical","offset":206},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"natural","offset":221},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":287},{"uri":"World_Heritage_site","surface_form":"World Heritage site","offset":294},{"uri":"Butrint_National_Park","surface_form":"National Park","offset":335},{"uri":"Epirus_(ancient_state)","surface_form":"Epirote","offset":386},{"uri":"Chaonians","surface_form":"Chaonians","offset":407},{"uri":"Late_Antiquity","surface_form":"Late Antiquity","offset":442},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":495},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archeological","offset":571},{"uri":"Vlor%C3%AB_County","surface_form":"Vlor\u00EB County","offset":593},{"uri":"Albania","surface_form":"Albania","offset":607},{"uri":"Sarand%C3%AB","surface_form":"Sarand\u00EB","offset":651},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greek","offset":676},{"uri":"Vivari_Channel","surface_form":"Vivari Channel","offset":730},{"uri":"Butrint_National_Park","surface_form":"Butrint National Park","offset":765},{"uri":"Sarand%C3%AB","surface_form":"Sarand\u00EB","offset":839},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet","offset":900},{"uri":"Nikita_Khrushchev","surface_form":"Nikita Khrushchev","offset":914},{"uri":"Corfu_(city)","surface_form":"Corfu","offset":1323},{"uri":"Konispol","surface_form":"Konispol","offset":1566}]}
