{"id":78339,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hurling (in Irish, \"iom\u00E1na\u00EDocht\" or \"iom\u00E1int\") is an Irish outdoor team sport similar to hockey, played by two teams of 15 people.\nThe object of the game is for players to use a wooden axe-shaped stick called a hurley (in Irish a \"cam\u00E1n\", pronounced kam-awn), or a hurl, to hit a small ball called a sliotar (pronounced slith-er) between the opponents' goalposts either over the crossbar for one point, or under the crossbar into a net guarded by a goalkeeper for one goal, which is equivalent to three points.\nThe ball can be caught in the hand and carried for not more than four steps, struck in the air, or struck on the ground with the stick. It can be kicked or slapped with an open hand (the hand pass) for short-range passing. A player who wants to carry the ball for more than three steps has to bounce or balance the ball on the end of the stick, and the ball can only be handled twice while in his possession.\nPlaying field.\nHurling is played on a pitch approximately 137m long and 82m wide The goals at each end of the field are formed by two posts, which are usually 6 m high, set 6.4 m apart, and connected 2.44 m above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending in back of the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goal posts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":25},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":66},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":85},{"uri":"Hockey","surface_form":"hockey","offset":102},{"uri":"Hurley_(stick)","surface_form":"hurley","offset":224},{"uri":"Hurley_(stick)","surface_form":"hurl","offset":278},{"uri":"Sliotar","surface_form":"sliotar","offset":313},{"uri":"Goalkeeper","surface_form":"goalkeeper","offset":462}]}
