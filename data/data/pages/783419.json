{"id":783419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language","text":"The Jeju language (Jeju: \uC81C\uC8FC\uB9D0, \"Jeju-mal\") is a Koreanic language spoken on the South Korean island of Jeju. It is related to Korean.\nHistory.\nThe Jeju language comes from Middle Korean, which is also the ancestor of the Korean language.\nJeju became a separate language from (mainland) Korean due to its isolation as an island and because in 1629, Jejuans were banned from leaving Jeju, causing more disconnection.\nUsage.\nUNESCO lists Jeju as a \"critically endangered\" language, since most of its speakers are over the age of 70. Younger Jejuans speak Korean instead. As of 2010, the language is spoken by 5,000 - 10,000 people, which is less than 2% of Jeju Island's total population.\nDialect or language.\nMany linguists think Jeju is its own language, mostly because mainland Koreans cannot understand it. Others think Jeju is a dialect of Korean, although a very different one. The local government calls Jeju as a separate language, and the idea of it being a language is becoming more accepted in both Korean and foreign academia. UNESCO listed Jeju as one of the world's languages in 2011.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Koreanic_languages","surface_form":"Koreanic language","offset":47},{"uri":"South_Korea","surface_form":"South Korean","offset":79},{"uri":"Jeju-do","surface_form":"Jeju","offset":102},{"uri":"Korean_language","surface_form":"Korean","offset":125},{"uri":"Middle_Korean_language","surface_form":"Middle Korean","offset":171},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":421},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguists","offset":711}]}
