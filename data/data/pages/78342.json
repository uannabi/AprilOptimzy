{"id":78342,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_(number)","text":"The number seven is a natural number that comes after six and before eight. In Roman numerals, it is VII.\nMathematics.\nIn mathematics, the number seven is an odd number and a prime number.\nIt is also a Mersenne prime.\nDivisibility Rule.\n77 is divisible by 7, so the original number 918785 is also divisible by 7.\nPretend formula_1 is the root number and formula_1 is the last digit. Then formula_1 is the whole number.\nIf the whole number (formula_1) is divisible by 7, formula_1 is also a multiple of 7. And formula_1 also divide 7. That proves formula_1 is divisible seven, since 3 and 6 are both multiples of 3. So formula_1 is also divisible by 7.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":4},{"uri":"Natural_number","surface_form":"natural number","offset":22},{"uri":"Six","surface_form":"six","offset":54},{"uri":"Eight","surface_form":"eight","offset":69},{"uri":"Roman_numerals","surface_form":"Roman numerals","offset":79},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":122},{"uri":"Odd_number","surface_form":"odd number","offset":158},{"uri":"Prime_number","surface_form":"prime number","offset":175},{"uri":"Mersenne_prime","surface_form":"Mersenne prime","offset":202},{"uri":"3_(number)","surface_form":"3","offset":582},{"uri":"6_(number)","surface_form":"6","offset":588},{"uri":"Multiple","surface_form":"multiple","offset":599}]}
