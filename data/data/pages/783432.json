{"id":783432,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiappa_Rhino","text":"The Chiappa Rhino is a revolver. It fires bullets from the bottom of the cylinder. This is different from most other revolvers, which fire from the top of the cylinder. This allows the Rhino to shoot even powerful bullets, like the .357 Magnum, with little recoil. As a result, the Rhino also has high accuracy and high rate of fire.\nThe Rhino is named after the rhinoceros because it looks somewhat like a rhinoceros's head. Most models shoot the.357 Magnum (as well as the .38 Special), but there are also models that shoot the 9x19mm Parabellum or the S&W.40. Due to its futuristic look, it is often shown in science-fiction movies like the live-action \"Ghost in the Shell\", ', and the remake of \"Total Recall\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Revolver","surface_form":"revolver","offset":23},{"uri":"Bullet","surface_form":"bullet","offset":42},{"uri":"Cylinder_(firearms)","surface_form":"cylinder","offset":73},{"uri":".357_Magnum","surface_form":".357 Magnum","offset":232},{"uri":"Recoil","surface_form":"recoil","offset":257},{"uri":"Rhinoceros","surface_form":"rhinoceros","offset":363},{"uri":".38_Special","surface_form":".38 Special","offset":475},{"uri":"9x19mm_Parabellum","surface_form":"9x19mm Parabellum","offset":530},{"uri":"S%26amp%3BW_.40","surface_form":"S&W.40","offset":555},{"uri":"Science_fiction_movie","surface_form":"science-fiction movies","offset":612},{"uri":"Live-action","surface_form":"live-action","offset":644},{"uri":"Ghost_in_the_Shell","surface_form":"Ghost in the Shell","offset":657},{"uri":"Remake","surface_form":"remake","offset":689}]}
