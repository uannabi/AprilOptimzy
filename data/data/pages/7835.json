{"id":7835,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgeball","text":"e=\"preserve\">Dodgeball is a sport played by throwing soft balls, or hard rubber balls, at people in a square court. The goal is to be the last one to be hit with the ball. Players may only throw balls at people who are not on their own team. If a player is hit by the ball,he or she should go to the outside of the court to the other team. From the outside, players throw the ball at players still on the inside.\nDodgeball is often played in elementary schools in physical education classes. Many school children play this game. In recent years, many adults who played it as children have formed adult leagues and clubs. Also, some schools have banned it (this means that made it against the rules to play it), because players can get hurt when playing the game. Tournaments are sometimes held in schools.\nDodgeball, because of its recent popularity, inspired a film ' (2004) starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and a game show, \"Extreme Dodgeball\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":28},{"uri":"Ball","surface_form":"ball","offset":58},{"uri":"Elementary_school","surface_form":"elementary school","offset":442},{"uri":"Physical_education","surface_form":"physical education","offset":464},{"uri":"Child","surface_form":"child","offset":504},{"uri":"Ben_Stiller","surface_form":"Ben Stiller","offset":885},{"uri":"Vince_Vaughn","surface_form":"Vince Vaughn","offset":901},{"uri":"Game_show","surface_form":"game show","offset":921},{"uri":"Extreme_Dodgeball","surface_form":"Extreme Dodgeball","offset":933}]}
