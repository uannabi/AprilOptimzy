{"id":78364,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurley_(stick)","text":"A hurley is a wooden stick measuring between 70 and 100 cm (26 to 40 inches) long with a flattened, curved end (called the \"bas\"), used to hit a \"sliotar\" (leather ball) in the Irish sport of hurling. It is also used in camogie, the female equivalent, and there often called a camogie stick.\nHurleys are made from ash wood, and are usually bought from local craftsmen in Ireland, who still use traditional production methods.\nNo matter how well crafted the hurley is, a hurler may well expect to use several hurleys over the course of the hurling season. The hurleys often break if two collide in the course of a game, or occasionally they break off on the other players (arms, legs, etc.). Two hurleys colliding is colloquially known as \"the clash of the ash.\" Throwing the hurley (e.g. to block a ball going high over one's head) is illegal, but camogie players may drop it to make a handpass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sliotar","surface_form":"sliotar","offset":146},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":177},{"uri":"Hurling","surface_form":"hurling","offset":192},{"uri":"Camogie","surface_form":"camogie","offset":220},{"uri":"Ash_tree","surface_form":"ash","offset":314}]}
