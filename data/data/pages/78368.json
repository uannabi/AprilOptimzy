{"id":78368,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie","text":"e=\"preserve\">Camogie (in Irish, \"cam\u00F3ga\u00EDocht\") is an Irish team sport, organised by the \"Camogie Association of Ireland\", the women's variant of hurling. The rules are almost identical to hurling with a few exceptions.\nOne is that goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players and a player in camogie can handpass a score, which is not allowed in the men's game. All games last 60 minutes (senior inter-county hurling games last 70), and dropping the camogie stick to handpass the ball is allowed. The All-Ireland Final is held every year in Croke Park during September, usually the week between the hurling final and Gaelic football final. There are two main competitions; the National League which is staged during the winter-spring months and is used as a warm-up to the All-Ireland Championships during the summer.\nThe reigning champions are Cork.\nThe name \"camogie\".\nCamogie/hurling is unique in that it uses a different name for the version played by men and women. The reason is complicated: men play using a curved stick called in Irish a \"cam\u00E1n\". Women would use a shorter stick, called by the diminutive form \"cam\u00F3g\". The suffix -\"a\u00EDocht\" was added to both words to give names for the sports: \"cam\u00E1na\u00EDocht\" (which became \"iom\u00E1na\u00EDocht\") and \"cam\u00F3ga\u00EDocht\". When the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in 1884 the English-origin name \"hurling\" was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to Anglicise the Irish name \"cam\u00F3ga\u00EDocht\" to \"camogie\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":25},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":53},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":64},{"uri":"Camogie_stick","surface_form":"camogie stick","offset":459},{"uri":"Croke_Park","surface_form":"Croke Park","offset":550},{"uri":"Gaelic_football","surface_form":"Gaelic football","offset":626},{"uri":"County_Cork","surface_form":"Cork","offset":854},{"uri":"Hurling","surface_form":"hurling","offset":888},{"uri":"Gaelic_Athletic_Association","surface_form":"Gaelic Athletic Association","offset":1282}]}
