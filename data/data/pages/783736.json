{"id":783736,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairngorms","text":"The Cairngorms (Scottish Gaelic: \"Am Monadh Ruadh\") is a group of mountains in the eastern part of Highlands of Scotland. It is usually linked with the mountain of the Cairn Gorm. The Cairngorms became part of Scotland's second national park (the Cairngorms National Park) on 1 September 2003. It was part of the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nThe Cairgorms, Angus Glens, Monadhliath, and lower areas of Strathspey, make up the Cairngorms National Park.\nGeography.\nThe Cairngorms is made of high plateau that is about 1000\u20131200\u00A0m above sea level. They have domed summits that that are around 1300\u00A0m. high. Many of the summits have tors. These are basically free-standing rock formations that stand on top of the rocky landscape.\nThe edges of the plateau that have narrow cliffs of granite. It makes it ideal for skiing, rock climbing and ice climbing.\nAnimals.\nThe area is home to birds such as ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, curlew and red grouse, as well as mammals such as mountain hare.\nThe plateau is also home to Britain's only herd of reindeer. Next to the central massif are the remainders of the Caledonian forest. These forests support many species that are not found anywhere elsewhere in the United Kingdom. These include red squirrels, pine marten, wood ants, Scottish crossbill, capercaillie and crested tit.\nActivities.\nThere are no glaciers in the area. However, snow can fall at any month of the year. In fact, some snow may be found all summer. It is the most ideal place for ice climbing in Britain.\nThe mountains are also popular for hill-walking, ski touring and climbing. There are also three alpine ski centres within the area: Cairn Gorm, The Lecht and Glenshee.\nThe range lies in the Scottish council areas of Aberdeenshire, Moray and Highland, and within the counties of Aberdeenshire, Invernessshire and Banffshire.\nName.\nCairn Gorm means \"Blue Cairn. A\"lthough the Gaelic \"gorm\" can also be used as an adjective and verb. It means green or greening, and is often seen in connection with growing grass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scottish_Gaelic","surface_form":"Scottish Gaelic","offset":16},{"uri":"East","surface_form":"eastern","offset":83},{"uri":"Scottish_Highlands","surface_form":"Highlands","offset":99},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":112},{"uri":"Link","surface_form":"linked","offset":136},{"uri":"Cairn_Gorm","surface_form":"Cairn Gorm","offset":168},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":228},{"uri":"Cairngorms_National_Park","surface_form":"Cairngorms National Park","offset":247},{"uri":"UNESCO","surface_form":"UNESCO","offset":331},{"uri":"List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"World Heritage Sites","offset":338},{"uri":"Angus_Glens","surface_form":"Angus Glens","offset":375},{"uri":"Monadhliath","surface_form":"Monadhliath","offset":388},{"uri":"Strathspey%2C_Scotland","surface_form":"Strathspey","offset":420},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":512},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":552},{"uri":"Dome","surface_form":"domed","offset":573},{"uri":"Summit","surface_form":"summits","offset":579},{"uri":"Tor_(rock_formation)","surface_form":"tors","offset":647},{"uri":"Geological_formation","surface_form":"rock formations","offset":687},{"uri":"Cliff","surface_form":"cliffs","offset":787},{"uri":"Skiing","surface_form":"skiing","offset":828},{"uri":"Rock_climbing","surface_form":"rock climbing","offset":836},{"uri":"Ice_climbing","surface_form":"ice climbing","offset":854},{"uri":"Rock_ptarmigan","surface_form":"ptarmigan","offset":911},{"uri":"Dotterel","surface_form":"dotterel","offset":922},{"uri":"Snow_bunting","surface_form":"snow bunting","offset":932},{"uri":"Curlew","surface_form":"curlew","offset":946},{"uri":"Red_grouse","surface_form":"red grouse","offset":957},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammals","offset":980},{"uri":"Mountain_hare","surface_form":"mountain hare","offset":996},{"uri":"Herd","surface_form":"herd","offset":1054},{"uri":"Reindeer","surface_form":"reindeer","offset":1062},{"uri":"Massif","surface_form":"massif","offset":1092},{"uri":"Caledonian_forest","surface_form":"Caledonian forest","offset":1125},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":1171},{"uri":"Red_squirrel","surface_form":"red squirrels","offset":1254},{"uri":"Pine_marten","surface_form":"pine marten","offset":1269},{"uri":"Wood_ant","surface_form":"wood ants","offset":1282},{"uri":"Scottish_crossbill","surface_form":"Scottish crossbill","offset":1293},{"uri":"Capercaillie","surface_form":"capercaillie","offset":1313},{"uri":"Crested_tit","surface_form":"crested tit","offset":1330},{"uri":"Ice_climbing","surface_form":"ice climbing","offset":1514},{"uri":"Hill-walking","surface_form":"hill-walking","offset":1574},{"uri":"Ski_touring","surface_form":"ski touring","offset":1588},{"uri":"Climbing","surface_form":"climbing","offset":1604},{"uri":"Alpine_climate","surface_form":"alpine","offset":1635},{"uri":"Ski_resort","surface_form":"ski centres","offset":1642},{"uri":"Cairn_Gorm","surface_form":"Cairn Gorm","offset":1671},{"uri":"The_Lecht","surface_form":"The Lecht","offset":1683},{"uri":"Glenshee","surface_form":"Glenshee","offset":1697},{"uri":"Subdivisions_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish council areas","offset":1729},{"uri":"Aberdeenshire","surface_form":"Aberdeenshire","offset":1755},{"uri":"Moray","surface_form":"Moray","offset":1770},{"uri":"Highland_(council_area)","surface_form":"Highland","offset":1780},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"counties","offset":1805},{"uri":"Aberdeenshire_(historic)","surface_form":"Aberdeenshire","offset":1817},{"uri":"Banffshire","surface_form":"Banffshire","offset":1851}]}
