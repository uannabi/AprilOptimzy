It is about the season most recently finished.\n2013.\nFor the fourth year in a row, the top 4 teams were Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Bayern Munich. Real Madrid became the first team to have over \u20AC500 million in revenue. Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli continued to go up the table quickly.\n2008.\nThe total revenue of the 20 richest clubs in the footballing world was over \u20AC3.73\u00A0billion. This was a record. Real Madrid stayed at the top of football's financial rankings for the third year in a row. Their revenue went up 20% to \u20AC351.8\u00A0million during the 2006\u201307 season.\nManchester United passed Barcelona into second place. The Spanish club moved down to third. Chelsea's revenue went up. They finished in the top five again, in fourth place. Arsenal's move to the Emirates Stadium changed their revenues. They moved up to fifth place. This was the first time any country (England) has had three clubs in the top five of the Money League.\nEuropean champions A.C. Milan moved up to sixth place. Runners-up Liverpool moved two places up to eighth. Italian champions Internazionale moved down two places to 9th. Bayern Munich moved up a place to seventh.

Barcelona moved up four places in the ranking for this year. This meant the two richest clubs were both from Spain. England has the largest number of clubs in the list. A club from Portugal was in the list for the first time. Portugal's Benfica is the third club from the Iberian Peninsula among the top 20 in the world, after Spain's Real Madrid and Barcelona.\n2006.\nIn the rankings for the 2004\u201305 season, Real Madrid was at the top.
