{"id":78389,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) (Irish: \"Cumann L\u00FAthchleas Gael\") is an organisation which is mostly focused on promoting Gaelic Games - traditional Irish sports, such as hurling, camogie, Gaelic football, handball, and rounders. The organisation also promotes Irish music and dance, and the Irish language. It is the largest and most popular organisation in Ireland with some 800,000 members out of the island's population of almost 6 million.\nGaelic football and Hurling are the main and most popular activities promoted by the organisation.\nGaelic football is a contact sport that combines the skills of soccer, basketball, and some of the skills of volleyball in a high-scoring game in which players punch or kick the ball over the crossbar for one point, or kick the ball into a net on the bottom for three points. The game also has similarities with Australian Rules Football (see below).\nHurling is a stick-and-ball game that combines many of the skills of field hockey, lacrosse, and baseball but pre-dates all three. Players can catch the ball and use a hurley (Irish: \"cam\u00E1n\") to hit a ball (sliotar) between the goalposts using the same scoring system as in Gaelic football and on the same size of field. It is not to be confused with the Scottish game of shinty.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":52},{"uri":"Gaelic_Games","surface_form":"Gaelic Games","offset":141},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":168},{"uri":"Hurling","surface_form":"hurling","offset":190},{"uri":"Camogie","surface_form":"camogie","offset":199},{"uri":"Gaelic_football","surface_form":"Gaelic football","offset":208},{"uri":"Gaelic_handball","surface_form":"handball","offset":225},{"uri":"Rounders","surface_form":"rounders","offset":239},{"uri":"Irish_music","surface_form":"Irish music","offset":280},{"uri":"Irish_dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":296},{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish language","offset":311},{"uri":"Soccer","surface_form":"soccer","offset":626},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":634},{"uri":"Volleyball","surface_form":"volleyball","offset":672},{"uri":"Australian_Rules_Football","surface_form":"Australian Rules Football","offset":875},{"uri":"Hockey","surface_form":"hockey","offset":989},{"uri":"Lacrosse","surface_form":"lacrosse","offset":997},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":1011},{"uri":"Hurley_(stick)","surface_form":"hurley","offset":1082},{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":1090},{"uri":"Ball","surface_form":"ball","offset":1115},{"uri":"Goalpost","surface_form":"goalpost","offset":1142},{"uri":"Shinty","surface_form":"shinty","offset":1286}]}
