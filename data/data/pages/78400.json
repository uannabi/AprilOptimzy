{"id":78400,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau","text":"A (plural ') is a manor house or residence of the lord of the manor or a country house of nobility or gentry.\nIt may have fortifications, but often has none. The term comes from French-speaking regions and is used most often for buildings in these regions. Where clarification is needed, a fortified ch\u00E2teau (that is, a castle) is called a \"ch\u00E2teau fort\". But the word is not used in the same way as \"castle\" is in English, and most ch\u00E2teaux are more appropriately described as \"palaces\" or \"country houses\" in English than as \"castles\". For example, the Ch\u00E2teau de Versailles is so called because it was in the country when it was built, but it does not bear any resemblance to a castle, so it is usually known in English as the Palace of Versailles.The Ch\u00E2teau de Montsoreau is the first Renaissance ch\u00E2teau to have been built in France, in the world famous Loire Valley. The Ch\u00E2teau de Montsoreau is also the only one to have been built in the Loire riverbed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Manor_house","surface_form":"manor house","offset":18},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"nobility","offset":90},{"uri":"Gentry","surface_form":"gentry","offset":102},{"uri":"Fortification","surface_form":"fortification","offset":122},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":178},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":320},{"uri":"Palace","surface_form":"palace","offset":479},{"uri":"Country_house","surface_form":"country house","offset":492},{"uri":"Palace_of_Versailles","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Versailles","offset":555},{"uri":"Chateau_de_Montsoreau","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Montsoreau","offset":755},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":790},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":832},{"uri":"Loire_Valley","surface_form":"Loire Valley","offset":860},{"uri":"Loire_River","surface_form":"Loire","offset":947}]}
