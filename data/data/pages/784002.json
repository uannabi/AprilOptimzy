{"id":784002,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attica_Prison_riot","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Attica Prison uprising, also known as the Attica Prison rebellion or Attica Prison riot, happened at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York, United States, in 1971.\nIt was a form of protest for demands of better living conditions and political rights. The uprising was one of the best-known and most significant flashpoints of the Prisoners' Rights Movement.\nOn September 9, 1971, two weeks after the killing of George Jackson at San Quentin State Prison, 1,281 of the Attica prison's about 2,200 inmates rioted and took control of the prison, taking 42 staff hostage.\nDuring the following four days of negotiations, authorities agreed to most of the prisoners' 28 demands, but would not agree to demands for complete amnesty from criminal prosecution for the prison takeover.\nBy the order of Governor Nelson Rockefeller, state police took back control of the prison. When the uprising was over, at least 43 people were dead, including ten correctional officers and civilian employees, and 33 inmates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Attica_Correctional_Facility","surface_form":"Attica Correctional Facility","offset":122},{"uri":"Attica_(town)%2C_New_York","surface_form":"Attica, New York","offset":154},{"uri":"Prisoners%27_rights","surface_form":"Prisoners' Rights","offset":362},{"uri":"George_Jackson_(activist)","surface_form":"George Jackson","offset":443},{"uri":"San_Quentin_State_Prison","surface_form":"San Quentin State Prison","offset":461},{"uri":"Amnesty","surface_form":"amnesty","offset":749},{"uri":"Nelson_Rockefeller","surface_form":"Nelson Rockefeller","offset":833},{"uri":"Correctional_officer","surface_form":"correctional officer","offset":971}]}
