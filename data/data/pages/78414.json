In North America, the term \"trapezium\" is used for what is elsewhere called an irregular quadrilateral.\nCalculating area.\nTo calculate the area of a trapezoid, you must add the two parallel sides together, divide that by 2, then times that by its height.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quadrilateral","surface_form":"quadrilateral","offset":76},{"uri":"Parallel_(geometry)","surface_form":"parallel","offset":157},{"uri":"Irregular_quadrilateral","surface_form":"irregular quadrilateral","offset":252}]}
