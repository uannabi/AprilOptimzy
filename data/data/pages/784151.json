{"id":784151,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranoidea_(genus)","text":"\"Ranoidea\" is a genus of frogs in the subfamily Pelodryadinae. They live in Australia, New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Louisiade Archipelago. Scientists still disagree with each other about whether \"Ranoidea\" should be its own genus or not and which frogs should be in it. Many of the frogs in \"Ranoidea\" used to be in \"Litoria\", \"Dryopsophus\", or \"Hyla\". In 2016, one team of scientists wrote a paper saying \"Litoria\" should be divided up into other genuses. Many other amphibian scientists read it and agreed, but some did not. One reason for this was that not all of the frogs in \"Litoria\" had been studied on the DNA level.\nDescription and ecology.\nAll frogs in \"Ranoidea\" have side-to-side pupils that open up-and-down and no coloring in their eyelid membrane. Many species have tadpoles that swim in mountain streams and have very large mouths on the undersides of their bodies.\nSpecies.\nScientists also think the Papua big-eyed tree frog (Van Kampen, 1909) might be in \"Ranoidea\" but they want to collect more data about where the frog lives first.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"Pelodryadinae","surface_form":"Pelodryadinae","offset":48},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":76},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":87},{"uri":"Maluku_Islands","surface_form":"Maluku Islands","offset":103},{"uri":"Louisiade_Archipelago","surface_form":"Louisiade Archipelago","offset":127},{"uri":"Litoria","surface_form":"Litoria","offset":328},{"uri":"Dryopsophus","surface_form":"Dryopsophus","offset":339},{"uri":"Hyla","surface_form":"Hyla","offset":357},{"uri":"Herpetology","surface_form":"amphibian scientists","offset":479},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":625},{"uri":"Pupil","surface_form":"pupil","offset":703},{"uri":"Eyelid","surface_form":"eyelid","offset":757},{"uri":"Tadpole","surface_form":"tadpole","offset":792},{"uri":"Papua_big-eyed_tree_frog","surface_form":"Papua big-eyed tree frog","offset":928}]}
