It is the smallest extant (living) specie of crocodile.\nDwarf crocodiles can reach an average adult length of 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The biggest recorded length for this species is 1.9 m (6.2 ft). Adult ones can weigh between 18 and 32 kg (40 and 71 lsb). The biggest females can be as heavy as 40 kg (88 lb), while the biggest males can weigh up to 80 kg (180 lb).\nThe dwarf crocodile is a shy and mainly nocturnal. It spends the day hiding in pools or burrows. Although, it occasionally may be active during the day.\nForaging is mainly done in or near the water. Although it is considered to be one of the most terrestrial species of crocodilian, it may expand the feeding pattern to land, usually after rains.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":61},{"uri":"Extant","surface_form":"extant","offset":91},{"uri":"Nocturnal","surface_form":"nocturnal","offset":471},{"uri":"Pool","surface_form":"pool","offset":510},{"uri":"Burrows","surface_form":"burrows","offset":519},{"uri":"Foraging","surface_form":"Foraging","offset":584},{"uri":"Terrestrial_animal","surface_form":"terrestrial","offset":678},{"uri":"Crocodilian","surface_form":"crocodilian","offset":701}]}
