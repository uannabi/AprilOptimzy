{"id":784742,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petunia_Pig","text":"e=\"preserve\">Petunia Pig is an animated fictional character under the \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" series of cartoons from Warner Bros. She looks quite a bit like her significant other, the Porky Pig. But she wears braids and a dress.\nPetunia was introduced by the animator Frank Tashlin in the 1937 short \"Porky's Romance\". The movie is a parody of a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon called \"Mickey's Nightmare\", except Mickey Mouse marries his long-time girlfriend Minnie Mouse in that movie. Porky's overtures toward Petunia bring him only the scornful laughs of his lover pig.\nTashlin adopted Petunia as a regular member of Porky's crew. He (Tashlin) showed her in two more cartoons: \"The Case of the Stuttering Pig\" and \"Porky's Double Trouble\".\nAs Porky's being popular was overshadowed in the late 1930s and 1940s by other characters, such as Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, he himself was reduced to a supporting player under new Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts. Petunia, only a bit player to Porky's lead, fared worse.\nBut later, Petunia made appearances in other specials, like \"Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol\".\nThe regular adult Petunia was a guest star under DC Comics' \"Looney Tunes comic book and in the official \"Looney Tunes\" website.\nPetunia also appears in \"Looney Tunes Cartoons\". Her first showing in the series was presented in the piece \"Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Animation","surface_form":"animated","offset":31},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":40},{"uri":"Looney_Tunes","surface_form":"Looney Tunes","offset":71},{"uri":"Merrie_Melodies","surface_form":"Merrie Melodies","offset":90},{"uri":"Warner_Bros.","surface_form":"Warner Bros.","offset":131},{"uri":"Porky_Pig","surface_form":"Porky Pig","offset":198},{"uri":"Dress","surface_form":"dress","offset":236},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":337},{"uri":"Walt_Disney","surface_form":"Walt Disney","offset":365},{"uri":"Cartoon","surface_form":"cartoon","offset":377},{"uri":"Mickey_Mouse","surface_form":"Mickey Mouse","offset":421},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marries","offset":434},{"uri":"Minnie_Mouse","surface_form":"Minnie Mouse","offset":467},{"uri":"Daffy_Duck","surface_form":"Daffy Duck","offset":850},{"uri":"Bugs_Bunny","surface_form":"Bugs Bunny","offset":865},{"uri":"DC_Comics","surface_form":"DC Comics","offset":1172},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":1243}]}
