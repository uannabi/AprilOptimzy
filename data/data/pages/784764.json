It lives on Cape York in Queensland.\nThis frog lives in rainforests with a monsoon climate and it likes areas with many vines close to water. The male frog has a call that sounds like a screech.\nThis frog has a green back and a yellow belly and orange feet. It has some purple coloring on its legs.\nScientists say this frog is closely related to \"Ranoidea gracilenta\" and even more closely related to \"Ranoidea auae.\" It looks so much like \"Ranoidea gracilenta\" that scientists used to think the two types of frog were the same species. The Cape York graceful tree frog was recognized as its own species in 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":57},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":72},{"uri":"Cape_York","surface_form":"Cape York","offset":95},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":108},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":139},{"uri":"Monsoon","surface_form":"monsoon","offset":158},{"uri":"Screech","surface_form":"screech","offset":269},{"uri":"Ranoidea_gracilenta","surface_form":"Ranoidea gracilenta","offset":430},{"uri":"Ranoidea_auae","surface_form":"Ranoidea auae","offset":485}]}
