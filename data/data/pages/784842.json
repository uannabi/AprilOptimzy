He is the rosh yeshiva of the Ponevezh Yeshiva, which is located in the Israeli city of Bnei Brak.\nLife story.\nRabbi Povarsky was born in the city of Kletsk in the Second Polish Republic; his father was Rabbi Dovid Povarsky. When he was three months old, he and his family moved to the city of Baranavichy, which was in the same country; this was because his father was becoming a teacher in the yeshiva of Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman. When he was ten years old, his entire family moved to Mandatory Palestine (present-day Israel), where he attended several schools before joining the Ponovezh Yeshiva, the school where his father was appointed rosh yeshiva. At that point, Baruch Dov was still a student. In 1954, after he got married, he became a teacher in the yeshiva, and later he became the rosh yeshiva.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Haredi","surface_form":"Haredi","offset":67},{"uri":"Rabbi","surface_form":"rabbi","offset":74},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":93},{"uri":"Rosh_yeshiva","surface_form":"rosh yeshiva","offset":111},{"uri":"Ponevezh_Yeshiva","surface_form":"Ponevezh Yeshiva","offset":131},{"uri":"Bnei_Brak","surface_form":"Bnei Brak","offset":189},{"uri":"Kletsk","surface_form":"Kletsk","offset":251},{"uri":"Second_Polish_Republic","surface_form":"Second Polish Republic","offset":265},{"uri":"Dovid_Povarsky","surface_form":"Dovid Povarsky","offset":310},{"uri":"Baranavichy","surface_form":"Baranavichy","offset":395},{"uri":"Elchonon_Wasserman","surface_form":"Elchonon Wasserman","offset":514},{"uri":"Mandatory_Palestine","surface_form":"Mandatory Palestine","offset":588},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":621},{"uri":"Ponovezh_Yeshiva","surface_form":"Ponovezh Yeshiva","offset":683},{"uri":"Rosh_yeshiva","surface_form":"rosh yeshiva","offset":743}]}
