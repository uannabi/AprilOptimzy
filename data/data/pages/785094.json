There are many of them in Senegal, Nigeria, Chad, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Kenya and Egypt, and in Tanzania. It is considered a Least Concern species.\nIn the Atlas Mountains, it was seen in altitudes as high as 1,800 m (5,900 ft). It is mostly a predator. It usually eats invertebrates and mammals as large as gazelle fawns, though larger animals are also sometimes eaten. Its diet also includes dead animals, human refuse, and fruit.
