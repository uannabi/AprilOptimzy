{"id":785165,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Quito","text":"The Metropolitan Cathedral of Quito (), known simply as \"la Catedral\", is the Catholic cathedral in Quito, Ecuador. Located on the southwest side of the Plaza de la Independencia (La Plaza Grande), it (and its older building) served as a seat of the Diocese of Quito from 1545 until 1848 when it became the Archdiocese. In 1995, it became the the Cathedral of Ecuador, making it the oldest Catholic church in the country.\nDescription.\nThe Cathedral is a white-painted monumental church with one high belltower to the right of the main entrance. It was built on a plan that has three longitudinal naves with semi-ogival arches on square pillars. The Cathedral is built like the kind of the 16th century. Based on interior features \u2014 like the details of the pillars, arches, and the carved and coffered ceiling \u2014 some experts say that the Cathedral should be thought of as Gothic-Mud\u00E9jar in style. It has Gothic features in the pointed arches of its naves, as well as in the ambulatory that goes around the presbytery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":78},{"uri":"Quito","surface_form":"Quito","offset":100},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":107},{"uri":"Plaza_de_La_Independencia","surface_form":"Plaza de la Independencia (La Plaza Grande)","offset":153},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Quito","surface_form":"Archdiocese","offset":307},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monumental","offset":468},{"uri":"Nave","surface_form":"nave","offset":596},{"uri":"Ogive","surface_form":"ogival","offset":612},{"uri":"Gothic_architecture","surface_form":"Gothic","offset":871},{"uri":"Ambulatory","surface_form":"ambulatory","offset":973},{"uri":"Presbytery_(architecture)","surface_form":"presbytery","offset":1005}]}
