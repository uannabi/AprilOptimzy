{"id":785334,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Laura","text":"Hurricane Laura was a deadly and destructive tropical cyclone that is tied with the 1856 Last Island hurricane for the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Louisiana in terms of maximum sustained winds. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major storm on the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura formed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa on August 16, and formed into a tropical depression by August 20. On August 21, Laura strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm, and breaking 1995's Hurricane Luis's record by eight days.\nLaura first moved over the Lesser Antilles and brushing Puerto Rico as a tropical storm, before making landfall in the resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, killing four people in the Dominican Republic and 31\u00A0in Haiti. The storm then moved over the entire island of Cuba, forcing the evacuation of more than 260,000\u00A0people. Then, the outer rainbands of Laura moved over parts of the Florida Keys and Southern Florida. It then moved over the warm Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before undergoing rapid intensification by August\u00A026. Later that day, Laura became a major hurricane, and soon reached a peak intensity of, making it a Category\u00A04 hurricane.\nThen, just a couple of hours after reaching peak intensity, at 6:00 UCT on August 27, Laura made landfall in Cameron, Louisiana just above peak intensity with 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 938 mbar, at the same wind speed of the 1856 Last Island hurricane. It was the 10th strongest tropical cyclone to ever hit the United States in terms of wind speed, killed 42 people in the U.S, and caused more than $14 billion in damage on the Gulf Coast of the United States and inland areas. After landfall, Laura weakened, falling to tropical storm status later in the day, and tropical depression status over Arkansas the next day. On August 29, Laura weakened to a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone over the East Coast. Overall, Laura caused $14.1 billion in damage and killed 77 people. Areas that were badly affected by Laura, mostly southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana, were badly affected by more flooding and strong winds during Hurricane Delta around six weeks later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":45},{"uri":"2020_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2020 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":294},{"uri":"Tropical_wave","surface_form":"tropical wave","offset":346},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"coast of West Africa","offset":379},{"uri":"Hurricane_Luis","surface_form":"1995's Hurricane Luis's","offset":578},{"uri":"Lesser_Antilles","surface_form":"Lesser Antilles","offset":651},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":680},{"uri":"Punta_Cana","surface_form":"Punta Cana, Dominican Republic","offset":758},{"uri":"Rainband","surface_form":"rainband","offset":974},{"uri":"Florida_Keys","surface_form":"Florida Keys","offset":1017},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Southern Florida","offset":1034},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":1080},{"uri":"Coordinated_Universal_Time","surface_form":"UCT","offset":1369},{"uri":"Cameron%2C_Louisiana","surface_form":"Cameron, Louisiana","offset":1410},{"uri":"Bar_(unit)","surface_form":"mbar","offset":1501},{"uri":"Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Gulf Coast of the United States","offset":1741},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":1910},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":1984},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":2022},{"uri":"East_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"East Coast","offset":2053},{"uri":"Hurricane_Delta","surface_form":"Hurricane Delta","offset":2289}]}
