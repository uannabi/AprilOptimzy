Even though the name has Antarctic in it, it does not live in Antarctica. The Antarctic fur seal mostly lives in Subantarctic islands.\nDescription.\nAdult males are dark brown in colour. Females and young ones tend to be paler, almost grey with lighter undersides. Young ones are dark brown at birth, almost black in color.\nMales are larger than females. Males can grow up to 2 m (6.5 ft) long. Males can also weigh 133 kg (293 lb). Females can grow up to 1.4 m (4.6 ft) long. Females can weight 34 kg (74.9 lb). At birth, the average length is 67.4cm (58\u201366). The average weight for young ones is 5.9kg (4.9\u20136.6) in males and 5.4kg (4.8\u20135.9) in females.\nMale Antarctic fur seals live up to 20 years. Females can live up to 24 years.\nDistribution.\nAntarctic fur seals are thought to be the most abundant type of fur seal. The largest gathering happens on South Georgia. The estimate for South Georgia is 4.5-6.2 million Antarctic fur seal and 46,834 at Bouvet\u00F8ya.\nBreeding colonies are found at South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands and Bouvet\u00F8ya in the Southern Atlantic Ocean; Marion Island, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Island and Heard Island in the Southern Indian Ocean; and Macquarie Island in the Southern Pacific Ocean. During winter, Antarctic fur seals range includes Antarctica to the Falkland Islands, and southern Argentina and Chile, reaching as far as the Mar del Plata and Gough Island.\nFeeding.\nIn the Atlantic region, the Antarctic fur seal usually eats Antarctic krill. In the Indian Ocean, they mostly eat fish and squid. Sometimes, penguins are eaten by male Antarctic fur seals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seal","surface_form":"seal","offset":63},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":160},{"uri":"Fur_seal","surface_form":"fur seal","offset":909},{"uri":"South_Georgia","surface_form":"South Georgia","offset":1092},{"uri":"South_Sandwich_Islands","surface_form":"South Sandwich Islands","offset":1107},{"uri":"South_Orkney_Islands","surface_form":"South Orkney Islands","offset":1131},{"uri":"South_Shetland_Islands","surface_form":"South Shetland Islands","offset":1153},{"uri":"Bouvet%C3%B8ya","surface_form":"Bouvet\u00F8ya","offset":1180},{"uri":"Southern_Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Atlantic Ocean","offset":1197},{"uri":"Marion_Island","surface_form":"Marion Island","offset":1222},{"uri":"Crozet_Islands","surface_form":"Crozet Islands","offset":1237},{"uri":"Kerguelen_Island","surface_form":"Kerguelen Island","offset":1253},{"uri":"Heard_Island","surface_form":"Heard Island","offset":1274},{"uri":"Southern_Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Indian Ocean","offset":1294},{"uri":"Macquarie_Island","surface_form":"Macquarie Island","offset":1321},{"uri":"Southern_Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Pacific Ocean","offset":1345},{"uri":"Range","surface_form":"range","offset":1404},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":1419},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":1437},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1468},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1482},{"uri":"Mar_del_Plata","surface_form":"Mar del Plata","offset":1512},{"uri":"Gough_Island","surface_form":"Gough Island","offset":1530},{"uri":"Antarctic_krill","surface_form":"Antarctic krill","offset":1613},{"uri":"Indian_Ocean","surface_form":"Indian Ocean","offset":1637},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":1667},{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":1676},{"uri":"Penguins","surface_form":"penguins","offset":1694}]}
