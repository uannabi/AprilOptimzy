{"id":78542,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy_gurdy","text":"A hurdy gurdy is a stringed musical instrument played by a rosin-covered wheel. It dates back to the Middle Ages.\nThe hurdy gurdy can create three types of sounds. The melody is played on melody strings by pressing keys on the side of the instrument. These press tangents against the strings. Hurdy gurdies can also have drone strings, which play one note continuously. Many hurdy gurdies also have a buzzing bridge. Turning the wheel faster causes this to make a rhythmic buzzing sound.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":28}]}
