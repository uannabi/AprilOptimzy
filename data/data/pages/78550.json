{"id":78550,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_P-47_Thunderbolt","text":"The P-47 Thunderbolt (also called The Jug) was a fighter aircraft made by Republic Aviation. It first flew in 1941, and was introduced in 1942. It had a very big Pratt and Whitney R-2800-59 engine, which had more than 2,000 horsepower. Because of this, the P-47 could go more than 430 miles per hour. In fact, it was the biggest engine ever at the time. It had 8 machine guns, 2 more than most fighters. It's shape and speed made it similar to the Fw 190.\nDuring 1944, the P-51 Mustang was lighter, faster, and could turn better. Because of this, it started replacing the P-47 as a fighter. The P-47 was then used for bombing in late World War II. It was retired from the American Air National Guard in 1955.\nNow, there is a jet called the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and it is named after the P-47.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":49},{"uri":"Republic_Aviation","surface_form":"Republic Aviation","offset":74},{"uri":"Pratt_and_Whitney","surface_form":"Pratt and Whitney","offset":162},{"uri":"Engine","surface_form":"engine","offset":190},{"uri":"Horsepower","surface_form":"horsepower","offset":224},{"uri":"Miles_per_hour","surface_form":"miles per hour","offset":285},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":363},{"uri":"Fw_190","surface_form":"Fw 190","offset":448},{"uri":"P-51_Mustang","surface_form":"P-51 Mustang","offset":473},{"uri":"Bomber","surface_form":"bombing","offset":618},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":634},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"American","offset":672},{"uri":"Air_National_Guard","surface_form":"Air National Guard","offset":681},{"uri":"Jet_aircraft","surface_form":"jet","offset":725},{"uri":"A-10_Thunderbolt_II","surface_form":"A-10 Thunderbolt II","offset":740}]}
