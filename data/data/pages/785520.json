{"id":785520,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled","text":"=\"preserve\">In cricket, a batter can be out bowled if the bowler delivers the ball to the batter and it hits the wicket behind the batter before touching anyone other than the batter. When the wicket is hit, one of its 5 sticks must fall to the ground for the batter to be out. A batter can't be bowled if the ball was not delivered legally.\nA batter can also be out leg before wicket (LBW) if they use their body to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":15},{"uri":"Out_(cricket)","surface_form":"out","offset":40},{"uri":"Bowler_(cricket)","surface_form":"bowler","offset":58},{"uri":"Wicket","surface_form":"wicket","offset":113},{"uri":"Leg_before_wicket","surface_form":"leg before wicket","offset":367}]}
