From 1913 to 1917 he is suspected in the swindling of at least three women and was connected with the deaths or disappearances of at least two women. After his death, searching through his properties, he was connected to the murders of three more women, with additional located jewelry and watches indicating possible other victims in New York and Missouri.\nAfter the discovery of Pallatinus remains, Schmidt's widow Adele Ulrich noted that Schmidt had allowed her to take a small peek into the cellar, where she later alleged the authorities would most likely find the bodies of Anita Schmidt and Greta Darsch.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["serial killer"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":418}]}
