{"id":785737,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture","text":"e=\"preserve\">Free culture is a concept and a movement that tries to help people share art very freely. It says copyright laws are too strict and tries to create a less limiting system. The word \"free\" In \"free culture\" means \"freedom\", not price.\nThe beginning of the movement is connected to Lawrence Lessig who has written a book named Free Culture and started Creative Commons, an organization that supports things like free culture and education. The movement is similar to free software movement but focuses on all art works, e.g. images or songs. Some free cultural works are for example the movie Big Buck Bunny or files at Wikimedia Commons. Wikipedia is also part of free culture because it uses a free license for its articles.\nThe rules.\nThe artist who creates something can make it free by adding a free license to it. Most famous free licenses are Creative Commons (CC) licenses. However, not all Creative Commons licenses are free (some for example prohibit commercial use or changing the work). The free CC licenses are CC0, CC-BY and CC-BY-SA.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":86},{"uri":"Lawrence_Lessig","surface_form":"Lawrence Lessig","offset":293},{"uri":"Creative_Commons","surface_form":"Creative Commons","offset":363},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free software movement","offset":478},{"uri":"Big_Buck_Bunny","surface_form":"Big Buck Bunny","offset":604},{"uri":"Wikimedia_Commons","surface_form":"Wikimedia Commons","offset":631},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":650}]}
