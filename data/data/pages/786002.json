{"id":786002,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_(season_2)","text":"The 2nd season of \"The Simpsons\" first started showing on television on October 11, 1990. The season started with the episode \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\". The season ended with the episode \"Blood Feud\" on July 11, 1991. The season was first released to DVD for Region 1 on August 6, 2002, Region 2 on July 8, 2002, and Region 4 on July 24, 2002. The episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" won a Primetime Emmy Award.\nRatings.\nAfter the first season, Fox moved \"The Simpsons\" to be shown on Thursday on television so that more people see it. This would create competition with \"The Cosby Show\" to see which show got better ratings. Producers of The Simpsons thought that the competition would lower their ratings. \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\", the first episode of the season, got almost the same Neilsen rating as \"The Cosby Show\". \"Bart Gets an \"F\" had a rank of 18.4 and \"The Cosby Show\" had a rank of 18.5. However, the episode was watched by 33.6 million people, which was more than the \"Cosby Show\". The episode is still the most watched episode in The Simpsons' history.\n\"Simpson and Delilah\", the second episode of the season, also had more people who watched it when it was first shown. The next episode, \"Treehouse of Horror\", did not get as many people to watch it as \"The Cosby Show\" did. \"Three Men and a Comic Book\" would be the only episode of this season to get a higher Neilsen rating than The Cosby Show of that day.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"The_Simpsons","surface_form":"The Simpsons","offset":19},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":58},{"uri":"Bart_Gets_an_%26quot%3BF%26quot%3B","surface_form":"Bart Gets an \"F\"","offset":127},{"uri":"Blood_Feud_(The_Simpsons)","surface_form":"Blood Feud","offset":181},{"uri":"DVD_region_code","surface_form":"Region 1","offset":252},{"uri":"DVD_region_code","surface_form":"Region 2","offset":280},{"uri":"DVD_region_code","surface_form":"Region 4","offset":310},{"uri":"Homer_vs._Lisa_and_the_8th_Commandment","surface_form":"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment","offset":350},{"uri":"Primetime_Emmy_Awards","surface_form":"Primetime Emmy Award","offset":396},{"uri":"The_Simpsons_(season_1)","surface_form":"first season","offset":437},{"uri":"Fox_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"Fox","offset":451},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":503},{"uri":"Competition","surface_form":"competition","offset":560},{"uri":"The_Cosby_Show","surface_form":"The Cosby Show","offset":578},{"uri":"Producer","surface_form":"Producer","offset":632},{"uri":"Lower","surface_form":"lower","offset":693},{"uri":"Bart_Gets_an_%26quot%3BF%26quot%3B","surface_form":"Bart Gets an \"F\"","offset":715},{"uri":"Neilsen_rating","surface_form":"Neilsen rating","offset":787},{"uri":"Simpson_and_Delilah","surface_form":"Simpson and Delilah","offset":1069},{"uri":"Treehouse_of_Horror_(The_Simpsons_episode)","surface_form":"Treehouse of Horror","offset":1205},{"uri":"Three_Men_and_a_Comic_Book","surface_form":"Three Men and a Comic Book","offset":1292}]}
