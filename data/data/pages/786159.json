{"id":786159,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Little_Indians","text":"The Ten Little Indians is an American nursery rhyme. The term \"Indians\" in this sense refers to the Native Americans in the United States.\nMinstrel song.\nSongwriter Septimus Winner created an elaborated version of the children's song, called \"Ten Little Injuns\", in 1868 for a minstrel show.\nBooks and songs.\nIt is generally thought the song was adapted, possibly by Frank J. Green in 1869 as \"Ten Little Niggers\". It's also possible, however, that the influence was the other way around, with \"Ten Little Niggers\" being a close reflection of the text which then became \"Ten Little Indians\".\nAgatha Christie's book, \"And Then There Were None\", was first called \"Ten Little Niggers\" and then \"Ten Little Indians\".\nCriticism of the racist language.\nDue to the use of racist words, modern versions for children usually use \"soldier boys\" or \"teddy bears\" as objects in the rhyme.\nReferences in popular culture.\n\"Ten Little Indians\" is a 1962 pop and rock-n-roll song from the Beach Boys. It's on their studio album \"Surfin' Safari\".\nSeveral \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" short films used the song. In \"Tom Tom Tomcat\", Tweety sings the song while writing down the number of Indian cats Granny has taken down so far.\nIn England's \"Mickey Mouse Annual\" No. 6, the song was adapted into the comic \"10 Little Mickey Kids\". It told of little mouse babies who met their end until there were two left.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":29},{"uri":"Nursery_rhyme","surface_form":"nursery rhyme","offset":38},{"uri":"Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"Native Americans in the United States","offset":100},{"uri":"Minstrel_show","surface_form":"minstrel show","offset":277},{"uri":"Adaptation","surface_form":"adapted","offset":346},{"uri":"Agatha_Christie","surface_form":"Agatha Christie","offset":592},{"uri":"And_Then_There_Were_None","surface_form":"And Then There Were None","offset":617},{"uri":"The_Beach_Boys","surface_form":"the Beach Boys","offset":969},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":999},{"uri":"Short_film","surface_form":"short film","offset":1075},{"uri":"Tom_Tom_Tomcat","surface_form":"Tom Tom Tomcat","offset":1106},{"uri":"Tweety","surface_form":"Tweety","offset":1123},{"uri":"Granny_(Looney_Tunes)","surface_form":"Granny","offset":1190},{"uri":"Mouse","surface_form":"mouse","offset":1341}]}
