{"id":7864,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa","text":"American Samoa (;,; also ' or ') is a territory of the United States. It is part of the Samoan Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean.\nIn 1899, Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan group of islands. The U.S. got the smaller group of islands on the east side. These islands had a good harbor near the capital city, Pago Pago. The western islands were run by Germany and then by New Zealand and are now the independent country Samoa.\nOfficially, American Samoa is an \"unorganized\" territory. This means that the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act. But the people who live in American Samoa rule themselves. Their constitution became effective on July 1, 1967.\nThe capital of American Samoa is Pago Pago, but the seat of government is Fagatogo.\nCitizenship.\nPeople who are born in American Samoa are called U.S. nationals, not U.S. citizens. This means they have some of the same rights as citizens but not all of them. Unlike people who are not Americans at all, American Samoans can go to any other part of the United States they want and live there for as long as they want. But they are not allowed to vote, to be on juries in court, to run for office, or to hold any job that the employee has to be a citizen to hold. For contrast, someone born in Puerto Rico or Guam is a citizen, so if they move to a state, they are allowed to vote in that state and in all federal elections.\nSome American Samoans like that they are not American citizens and others do not. Some American Samoans say that being nationals and not citizens makes it easier for them to keep the fa'a Samoa, the Samoan way of life. In 2019, three American Samoans living in Utah sued the U.S. government to say they are citizens. The judge agreed with them. The judge said that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that anyone born in any part of the United States is a citizen, and that should mean American Samoans too. But the next day, he said they should not register to vote until after an appeal judge has seen the case.\nIn 2016, the United States Supreme Court decided they did not want to look at a case about whether American Samoans are citizens.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":38},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":55},{"uri":"Samoan_Islands","surface_form":"Samoan Islands","offset":88},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":119},{"uri":"1899","surface_form":"1899","offset":137},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":143},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"group of islands","offset":183},{"uri":"Pago_Pago","surface_form":"Pago Pago","offset":316},{"uri":"Samoa","surface_form":"Samoa","offset":427},{"uri":"July_1","surface_form":"July 1","offset":655},{"uri":"1967","surface_form":"1967","offset":663},{"uri":"Pago_Pago","surface_form":"Pago Pago","offset":702},{"uri":"Fagatogo","surface_form":"Fagatogo","offset":743},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":1261},{"uri":"Guam","surface_form":"Guam","offset":1276},{"uri":"Fa%27a_Samoa","surface_form":"fa'a Samoa","offset":1575},{"uri":"Utah","surface_form":"Utah","offset":1653},{"uri":"Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution","offset":1761}]}
