{"id":78642,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archosaur","text":"Archosaurs are a large group of reptiles, including all crocodiles, birds, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs (flying reptiles). There are also a number of smaller extinct groups, mostly from the Triassic period.\nThe Archosaurs are definitely a monophyletic clade, and do not include reptiles such as the Squamata (lizards and snakes) and the Sphenodontia (\"Sphenodon\").\nThe archosaurs or their immediate ancestors survived the catastrophic Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event. Then, in the early and middle Triassic, there was rapid evolution into the types of aquatic and land tetrapods which dominated the rest of the Mesozoic era.\nArchosauromorpha.\nThis is an even wider group, which includes diapsid Sauropsida which appeared in the middle Permian and Triassic periods. Their relationships are not well established at present.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":56},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":68},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":75},{"uri":"Pterosaur","surface_form":"pterosaur","offset":90},{"uri":"Extinct","surface_form":"extinct","offset":155},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":187},{"uri":"Monophyletic","surface_form":"monophyletic","offset":236},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":249},{"uri":"Squamata","surface_form":"Squamata","offset":296},{"uri":"Sphenodon","surface_form":"Sphenodon","offset":349},{"uri":"Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event","surface_form":"Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event","offset":432},{"uri":"Tetrapods","surface_form":"tetrapods","offset":568},{"uri":"Mesozoic_era","surface_form":"Mesozoic era","offset":610},{"uri":"Diapsid","surface_form":"diapsid","offset":686},{"uri":"Permian","surface_form":"Permian","offset":734},{"uri":"Triassic","surface_form":"Triassic","offset":746}]}
