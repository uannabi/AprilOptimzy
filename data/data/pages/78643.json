{"id":78643,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Explorer","text":"The MS \"Explorer\" was a cruise ship (\"MS\" stands for motor ship). It had been known as MS \"Lindblad Explorer\" (\u20131985) and MS \"Society Explorer\" (\u20131992). It was registered in Liberia. It was designed for sailing in cold areas, such as around Antarctica. The MS \"Explorer\" was originally ordered by the Swedish explorer Lars-Eric Lindblad. The ship was sold several times. Its last owner was the Toronto-based travel company G.A.P Adventures. It had bought the \"Explorer\" in 2004.\nBesides being the first cruise ship ever built specifically to ply the frigid waters of the Antarctic Ocean, the \"Explorer\" became the first ever to sink there when it struck an unidentified submerged object, possibly ice, on November 23, 2007, which caused a 10-by-4\u00A0inch (25 \u00D7 10\u00A0cm) gash in the hull. Everyone escaped from \"Explorer\" in the early hours of November 23, 2007, after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, which is usually stormy, but was calm at the time. The \"Explorer\" was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position: 62 degrees 24 minute South and 57 degrees 16 minutes west, between South Shetlands and Grahams Land, in the Bransfield Strait, where the depth is roughly 2,000 feet (600\u00A0m).\nHistory.\nCommissioned by Lars-Eric Lindblad, the Swedish-American pioneer of exotic expedition tours, the \"Explorer\" was built in 1969 at Nystads Varv shipyard in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The ship was built to stay afloat with two of its compartments filled with water, and its ice class on the HELCOM scale was IC.\nThe vessel was originally named the \"Lindblad Explorer\" in honor of Lars-Eric Lindblad. On February 11, 1972 the \"Explorer\" ran aground (into the ground) near La Plaza Point, Antarctica; its passengers, Lars-Eric Lindblad among them, were rescued by the Chilean Navy. It was towed to Buenos Aires, Argentina and then to Kristiansand, Norway for repairs.\nIn 1998 \"Explorer\" was the first ship to sail around the James Ross Island;.\nThe \"Explorer\" was depicted on at least two postage stamps issued by South Georgia.\nSinking.\nThe ship left Ushuaia, Argentina on November 11, 2007, on a 19-day cruise intended to trace the route of 20th century explorer Ernest Shackleton through the Drake Passage (an area typically stormy with rough seas). After visiting the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island the \"Explorer\" hit an unidentified submerged object in the Bransfield Strait close to King George Island in the Antarctic Ocean, near the South Shetland Islands, on November 23, 2007. The object struck by the \"Explorer\" caused a 10-by-4\u00A0inch (25 \u00D7 10\u00A0cm) hole to the ship's port side (left side) which allowed sea water to enter the ship.\nA passenger reported sea water in the cabin at about 03:00 UTC. Although some reports indicate there had been no noticeable impact, or at least nothing more than the normal crunching of ice experienced when sailing through icy waters, other reports say that there was a loud bang. Some reports also indicate that the ship drifted into an iceberg on the \"Explorer's\" starboard side while the crew was assessing damage caused by the original impact to the port side of the ship.\nA mayday call was put out by the ship at 04:24 UTC, and rescue operations were quickly coordinated by the Prefectura Naval (Coast Guard Corps) of the Argentine Republic, and the Chilean Navy Center for Search and Rescue. Chile dispatched the icebreaker \"Almirante Viel\", and nearby commercial ships including the MN \"Ushuaia\", the \"National Geographic Endeavor\", and the Norwegian Coastal Express ship MS \"Nordnorge\" which was operating as a passenger cruise ship at the time. By 07:30 UTC, all 91 passengers, 9 guides and 54 crew, from over 14 countries\n, left the ship and took to the life rafts, where they drifted for three to four hours, until they were picked up by the Norwegian ship MS \"Nordnorge\" which arrived on scene by 10:00 UTC.\nIt is believed that the \"Explorer\" sank at about 19:00 UTC. Coincidentally, earlier in 2007, the MS \"Nordnorge\" was involved in another Antarctic rescue when it evacuated 294 passengers from a sister ship, the MS \"Nordkapp\", when the Nordkapp ran aground on Deception Island, a part of these same remote South Shetland Islands archipelago.\nSome of those rescued by the \"Nordnorge\" were taken to the Chilean Eduardo Frei Montalva Station on King George Island. Later they were flown by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft of the Chilean Air Force to Punta Arenas, Chile, in two separate flights on Saturday, November 24, and Sunday, November 25, 2007. Approximately 70 of the survivors were taken to Uruguay\u2019s Artigas Base. The \"Explorer\" sank within 20 hours after striking an unknown submerged object reported to be ice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liberia","surface_form":"Liberia","offset":174},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":241},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":301},{"uri":"Lars-Eric_Lindblad","surface_form":"Lars-Eric Lindblad","offset":318},{"uri":"Toronto","surface_form":"Toronto","offset":394},{"uri":"G.A.P_Adventures","surface_form":"G.A.P Adventures","offset":423},{"uri":"Antarctic_Ocean","surface_form":"Antarctic Ocean","offset":571},{"uri":"Shetland_Islands","surface_form":"Shetland Islands","offset":894},{"uri":"Southern_Ocean","surface_form":"Southern Ocean","offset":918},{"uri":"Chilean_Navy","surface_form":"Chilean Navy","offset":1021},{"uri":"Antarctic_Peninsula","surface_form":"Grahams Land","offset":1161},{"uri":"Bransfield_Strait","surface_form":"Bransfield Strait","offset":1182},{"uri":"Lars-Eric_Lindblad","surface_form":"Lars-Eric Lindblad","offset":1273},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":1297},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1305},{"uri":"Uusikaupunki","surface_form":"Uusikaupunki","offset":1411},{"uri":"Finland","surface_form":"Finland","offset":1425},{"uri":"Ice_class","surface_form":"ice class","offset":1524},{"uri":"Baltic_Marine_Environment_Protection_Commission","surface_form":"HELCOM","offset":1541},{"uri":"February_11","surface_form":"February 11","offset":1653},{"uri":"1972","surface_form":"1972","offset":1666},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":1737},{"uri":"Buenos_Aires","surface_form":"Buenos Aires","offset":1846},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1860},{"uri":"Kristiansand","surface_form":"Kristiansand","offset":1882},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1896},{"uri":"James_Ross_Island","surface_form":"James Ross Island","offset":1973},{"uri":"South_Georgia","surface_form":"South Georgia","offset":2062},{"uri":"Ushuaia","surface_form":"Ushuaia","offset":2100},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":2109},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":2191},{"uri":"Ernest_Shackleton","surface_form":"Ernest Shackleton","offset":2213},{"uri":"Drake_Passage","surface_form":"Drake Passage","offset":2243},{"uri":"Falkland_Islands","surface_form":"Falkland Islands","offset":2320},{"uri":"South_Georgia_Island","surface_form":"South Georgia Island","offset":2341},{"uri":"Bransfield_Strait","surface_form":"Bransfield Strait","offset":2421},{"uri":"King_George_Island","surface_form":"King George Island","offset":2448},{"uri":"Antarctic_Ocean","surface_form":"Antarctic Ocean","offset":2474},{"uri":"South_Shetland_Islands","surface_form":"South Shetland Islands","offset":2500},{"uri":"Mayday_(distress_signal)","surface_form":"mayday","offset":3180},{"uri":"Prefectura_Naval_Argentina","surface_form":"Prefectura Naval","offset":3284},{"uri":"Argentine_Republic","surface_form":"Argentine Republic","offset":3328},{"uri":"Chilean_Navy","surface_form":"Chilean Navy","offset":3356},{"uri":"Search_and_rescue","surface_form":"Center for Search and Rescue","offset":3369},{"uri":"Icebreaker","surface_form":"icebreaker","offset":3420},{"uri":"Chilean_icebreaker_Contraalmirante_Oscar_Viel_Toro","surface_form":"\"Almirante Viel\"","offset":3431},{"uri":"National_Geographic_Endeavor","surface_form":"National Geographic Endeavor","offset":3510},{"uri":"Hurtigruten","surface_form":"Coastal Express","offset":3559},{"uri":"MS_Nordnorge","surface_form":"MS \"Nordnorge\"","offset":3580},{"uri":"Liferaft","surface_form":"life rafts","offset":3765},{"uri":"MS_Nordkapp","surface_form":"MS \"Nordkapp\"","offset":4131},{"uri":"Deception_Island_(South_Shetland_Islands)","surface_form":"Deception Island","offset":4179},{"uri":"South_Shetland_Islands","surface_form":"South Shetland Islands","offset":4225},{"uri":"Archipelago","surface_form":"archipelago","offset":4248},{"uri":"Eduardo_Frei_Montalva_Station","surface_form":"Eduardo Frei Montalva Station","offset":4328},{"uri":"C-130","surface_form":"C-130 Hercules","offset":4406},{"uri":"Cargo_aircraft","surface_form":"transport aircraft","offset":4421},{"uri":"Chilean_Air_Force","surface_form":"Chilean Air Force","offset":4447},{"uri":"Punta_Arenas%2C_Chile","surface_form":"Punta Arenas, Chile","offset":4468},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":4618},{"uri":"Artigas_Base","surface_form":"Artigas Base","offset":4628}]}
