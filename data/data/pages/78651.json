{"id":78651,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalagmite","text":"A stalagmite is a form that can be found on the floor of a cave. It rises from the floor of a limestone cave when mineralized solutions drip from the ceiling and deposits of calcium carbonate form columns on the ground. The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite.\nWhen touring caves with stalactites and stalagmites you might be asked to not touch the rock formations. This is generally because the formation is considered to still be growing and forming. Since the rock buildup is formed by minerals solidifying out of the water solution, skin oils can disturb where the mineral water will cling. So the development of the rock formation will be affected and not will not be natural anymore.\nStalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors, but they form much more quickly on concrete than in the natural cave environment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Floor","surface_form":"floor","offset":48},{"uri":"Cave","surface_form":"cave","offset":59},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":94},{"uri":"Solution","surface_form":"solution","offset":126},{"uri":"Deposition_(geology)","surface_form":"deposits","offset":162},{"uri":"Calcium_carbonate","surface_form":"calcium carbonate","offset":174},{"uri":"Stalactite","surface_form":"stalactite","offset":287},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":575},{"uri":"Concrete","surface_form":"concrete","offset":773}]}
