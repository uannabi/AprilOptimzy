{"id":786596,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions","text":"e=\"preserve\">Special functions are some mathematical functions used in mathematical analysis or physics. Most of them appear in higher education. Some experts are studying numerical methods for them.\nDefinition.\nIn mathematics, most functions are defined as a solution of a differential equation. For example, the exponential function formula_1 is the solution of the ordinary differential equation formula_1. Due to this relation, some mathematicians are studying the connection between ODEs and special functions.\nExamples.\nFor more examples, find textbooks named \"special functions\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematical_analysis","surface_form":"mathematical analysis","offset":71},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":96},{"uri":"Higher_education","surface_form":"higher education","offset":128},{"uri":"Numerical_analysis","surface_form":"numerical methods","offset":172},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":215},{"uri":"Differential_equation","surface_form":"differential equation","offset":274},{"uri":"Exponential_function","surface_form":"exponential function","offset":314},{"uri":"Ordinary_differential_equation","surface_form":"ordinary differential equation","offset":368},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":437},{"uri":"Textbook","surface_form":"textbook","offset":550}]}
