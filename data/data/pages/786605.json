Lea Gottlieb was an Israeli fashion designer and businesswoman. Made a swimsuit, once a purely functional thing, a high fashion item.\nBiography.\nLea Lenke Roth (later Gottlieb) was born in Saj\u00F3szentp\u00E9ter, Hungary. At the end of World War II, the Gottlieb-Lea family, her husband Armin and their young daughters moved to Israel from Hungary. The decision to immigrate was tough, but the situation in Hungary in the post-war years left little choice for the Lea family. After arriving in Israel, the Leah Gottlieb family settled in a very small house located in the former Arab quarter. Lea and Armin started working right away. Lea continued to sew children's clothes, just as she did in Hungary. While this did not make the Gottlieb family much money, Lea continued to pursue sewing and design. She started to get involved in sewing when she was only six years old. Already in those years, many noted her talent and ability to create an original, unique design. Finally, her natural talent was shaped by the education she received in the specialty - fashion design.\nFashion career.\nWith money borrowed from family and friends, she and her husband opened a similar raincoat factory near Tel Aviv in 1949.\nAs a result, in 1956 they founded Gottex, a high-fashion beachwear and swimwear company that became a leading exporter, shipping to 80 countries. The company's name is a combination of \"Gottlieb\" and \"textiles\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"September_17","surface_form":"September 17,","offset":28},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":42},{"uri":"November_17","surface_form":"November 17,","offset":49},{"uri":"2012","surface_form":"2012","offset":62},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungary","offset":306}]}
