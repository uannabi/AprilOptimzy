{"id":786771,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_languages","text":"The Polynesian languages are a group of languages spoken in Oceania. They all belong in the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages. They are mostly spoken in Polynesia, but some are spoken in nearby Melanesia and Micronesia.\nThere are around 30-40 Polynesian languages, with Samoan having the most speakers. Other well-known Polynesian languages include M\u0101ori, Tongan, Hawaiian and Tahitian.\nHistory.\nThe Polynesian languages formed when Austronesians in New Caledonia (the Lapita culture) started moving to other parts of Oceania. Navigation of Oceania continued until 1300AD, with the discovery of New Zealand (Aotearoa) by the M\u0101ori people.\nToday, there are over 2 million Polynesians, although speakers of Polynesian languages number far less due to historical reasons such as disease and colonialism.\nSound changes.\nThroughout the Polynesian languages, many sound changes occur. They mainly exist in consonants. For example, Samoan \"f\" corresponds to Hawaiian \"h\".\nHawaiian \"h'\"ale\" - Samoan \"f'\"ale\" (house)\nHawaiian \"aloha\" - Samoan \"talofa\" (hello)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oceania","surface_form":"Oceania","offset":60},{"uri":"Malayo-Polynesian_languages","surface_form":"Malayo-Polynesian","offset":92},{"uri":"Austronesian_languages","surface_form":"Austronesian languages","offset":124},{"uri":"Polynesia","surface_form":"Polynesia","offset":174},{"uri":"Melanesia","surface_form":"Melanesia","offset":215},{"uri":"Micronesia","surface_form":"Micronesia","offset":229},{"uri":"Samoan_language","surface_form":"Samoan","offset":291},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_language","surface_form":"M\u0101ori","offset":370},{"uri":"Tongan_language","surface_form":"Tongan","offset":377},{"uri":"Hawaiian_language","surface_form":"Hawaiian","offset":385},{"uri":"Tahitian_language","surface_form":"Tahitian","offset":398},{"uri":"New_Caledonia","surface_form":"New Caledonia","offset":471},{"uri":"Lapita_culture","surface_form":"Lapita culture","offset":490},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":616},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"M\u0101ori people","offset":646},{"uri":"Polynesian_people","surface_form":"Polynesians","offset":692}]}
