{"id":7870,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid","text":"A liquid is a form of matter. It is settled between solid and gas. Liquid has an almost-fixed volume, but no set shape.\nEvery small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing. Because of that, gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container. The molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves.\nFluids that flow slowly have a high viscosity. Some fluids like tar have such a high viscosity that they may seem solid.\nIt is difficult to compress a liquid. If a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature, it will become a solid. This temperature is called the melting point or freezing point and is different for every different type of liquid. If a liquid is heated up it becomes a gas. The temperature this happens at is called the boiling point.\nExamples of liquid are water, oils and blood.\nwhere \"z\" is the depth of the point below the surface and \"g\" is how strong gravity is pulling on the liquid. \"\u03C1\" is a number that tells us how heavy a set amount of the liquid is. We call this the density and it is different for all liquids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":22},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":52},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":62},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":94},{"uri":"Flux","surface_form":"flowing","offset":173},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":237},{"uri":"Container","surface_form":"container","offset":250},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":265},{"uri":"Viscosity","surface_form":"viscosity","offset":369},{"uri":"Tar","surface_form":"tar","offset":397},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":447},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":583},{"uri":"Melting_point","surface_form":"melting point","offset":621},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":744},{"uri":"Boiling_point","surface_form":"boiling point","offset":795},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":833},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":840},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":849},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":932},{"uri":"Density","surface_form":"density","offset":1054}]}
