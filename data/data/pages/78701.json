As well as the two Ch\u00E2teau's, a number of other important buildings are there, such as the \"Ch\u00E2teau de la Majorie\", the \"H\u00F4tel de Ville\" and the \"Cath\u00E9drale Notre-Dame de Sion\".\nHistory.\nSion really started to develop during the time when Celts were big.\nIt takes its name from the Latin word \"Sedunum\".
