{"id":787330,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-eyed_tree_frog","text":"The big-eyed tree frog, Amani Forest tree frog, vermiculated tree frog (\"Leptopelis vermiculatus\") is a frog from the Eastern Arc Mountains and a few other places in Tanzania. Scientists saw it on between 900 and 1800 meters above sea level.\nThe adult male frog is 3.9 to 5.0 cm long and the female is 6.1 to 8.5 cm long. It lives in forests. It likes to sit on tree limbs hanging over the water.\nAll young frogs and some adult males are bright green with a black pattern. Adult females and many adult males are gold-brown in color, with patterns on their backs and dark marks behind their eyes. This frog has discs at the ends of its toes. These discs help it climb.\nThis frog is endangered because humans like to cut down its forests to build farms. These are mostly small farms, not large corporate farms. In many of the places where this frog lives, there are no laws against doing this.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":104},{"uri":"Tanzania","surface_form":"Tanzania","offset":166},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":231}]}
