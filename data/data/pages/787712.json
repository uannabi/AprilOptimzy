{"id":787712,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_(band)","text":"Thompson is a Croatian ethno band, founded by Marko Perkovi\u0107 aka \"Thompson\", often thought of as the same as the band itself. \"Thompson\" is Perkovi\u0107's stage name. He is the songwriter and lead vocalist. The members of the band, aside from him, are Tomislav Mandari\u0107, Ivan Ivankovi\u0107, Duje Ivi\u0107, and Ivica Bili\u0107 Ike.\nThe band name originates from the Thompson submachine gun, a nickname given to Perkovi\u0107 while he fought in the Croatian War of Independence. Although mostly formed in \u010Cavoglave, Thompson is currently based in Zagreb. Thompson came to be popular during the Croatian war in 1991, with the release of the first single \"Bojna \u010Cavoglave\", which is about the Croatian participation in the Yugoslav Wars and was included in the compilation album \"Rock za Hrvatsku\". This song, with slightly different lyrics, named \"Branitelji Sarajeva\", was sung by the BiH Army during the Siege of Sarajevo (\"Sarajevo zaboravit ne\u0107e nikada\"). During the 1990s Thompson became popular in Croatia with the release of the first album \"Moli mala\" in 1992. They later became popular again with the hit \"Prijatelji\" in 1998.\nIn 2002, Thompson started their first major tour to promote the album \"E, moj narode\". This tour continued on and off until 2005, and included concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Melbourne's Vodafone Arena. In May 2005, the album was declared a Diamond Record with more than 60,000 copies sold. Touring continued in 2006 with \"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\", again performing internationally with concerts in Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, and the United States.\nThompson features annually at the Homeland Victory celebrations in their hometown of \u010Cavoglave. These performances are attended by as many as 60,000 to 100,000 viewers, and feature Croatian singers like Mate Buli\u0107, Dra\u017Een Ze\u010Di\u0107, Ivan Mikuli\u0107, and Baruni. The band has became controversial for its alleged praise of the World War Two Nazi-affiliated Usta\u0161e regime in their songs and concerts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marko_Perkovi%C4%87","surface_form":"Marko Perkovi\u0107","offset":46},{"uri":"Stage_name","surface_form":"stage name","offset":151},{"uri":"Lead_vocalist","surface_form":"lead vocalist","offset":188},{"uri":"Thompson_submachine_gun","surface_form":"Thompson submachine gun","offset":349},{"uri":"Croatian_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"Croatian War of Independence","offset":426},{"uri":"%C4%8Cavoglave","surface_form":"\u010Cavoglave","offset":482},{"uri":"Zagreb","surface_form":"Zagreb","offset":524},{"uri":"Yugoslav_Wars","surface_form":"Yugoslav Wars","offset":698},{"uri":"Rock_za_Hrvatsku","surface_form":"Rock za Hrvatsku","offset":755},{"uri":"Army_of_the_Republic_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","surface_form":"BiH Army","offset":862},{"uri":"Siege_of_Sarajevo","surface_form":"Siege of Sarajevo","offset":882},{"uri":"Moli_mala","surface_form":"Moli mala","offset":1025},{"uri":"E%2C_moj_narode","surface_form":"E, moj narode","offset":1183},{"uri":"Sydney_Entertainment_Centre","surface_form":"Sydney Entertainment Centre","offset":1271},{"uri":"Melbourne","surface_form":"Melbourne","offset":1303},{"uri":"Melbourne_Arena","surface_form":"Vodafone Arena","offset":1315},{"uri":"Bilo_jednom_u_Hrvatskoj","surface_form":"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj","offset":1451},{"uri":"Victory_Day_(Croatia)","surface_form":"Homeland Victory celebrations","offset":1620},{"uri":"Mate_Buli%C4%87","surface_form":"Mate Buli\u0107","offset":1789},{"uri":"Dra%C5%BEen_Ze%C4%8Di%C4%87","surface_form":"Dra\u017Een Ze\u010Di\u0107","offset":1801},{"uri":"Ivan_Mikuli%C4%87","surface_form":"Ivan Mikuli\u0107","offset":1815},{"uri":"Baruni","surface_form":"Baruni","offset":1833},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":1919},{"uri":"Usta%C5%A1e","surface_form":"Usta\u0161e","offset":1935}]}
