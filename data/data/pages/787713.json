{"id":787713,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugoton","text":"Jugoton was the largest record label and chain record store in the former Yugoslavia based in Zagreb, SR Croatia.\nHistory.\nJugoton was created in 1947. It is notable for releasing some of the most important former Yugoslav pop and rock records. The company also owned a large network of record shops across SFR Yugoslavia.\nAfter the break-up of Yugoslavia began, the company changed its name to Croatia Records in 1991.\nArtists.\nJugoton also released the popular compilation album \"Paket aran\u017Eman\". Many artists that represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest were signed with Jugoton, including the 1989 winners Riva.\nLike other former Yugoslav labels, Jugoton also had a licence to release foreign titles for the Yugoslav market including notable international popular music stars such as: Rick Astley, The Beatles, David Bowie, Kate Bush, Deep Purple, Eurythmics, Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk, John Lennon, Madonna, Gary Moore, M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe, Elvis Presley, Pink Floyd, Public Image Limited, Queen, The Rolling Stones, Scorpions, U2, Whitesnake, Kim Wilde and others.\nCompetition.\nOther major labels in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were: PGP-RTB and Jugodisk from Belgrade; Suzy from Zagreb; Diskoton from Sarajevo; ZKP RTLJ from Ljubljana and others.\nYugonostalgia.\nJugoton, as an important part of the former Yugoslav culture is one of the subjects of Yugonostalgia.\nThe former Jugoton record shop located in the main shopping mall in Skopje (\"Gradski Trgovski Centar\"), North Macedonia, still operates under the same name managed by the Macedonian record label Lithium Records.\nAn example of different kind is the online radio and web tv station called Jugoton which operates in the Yugoslav diaspora in Vienna, Austria. It plays music from the former Yugoslavia, but also from all the contemporary former Yugoslav countries, including pop, rock and folk. However, it is not formally related to the actual Jugoton, and not all the Yugoslav artists represented in its program were really signed to the label.\nYugoton.\n\"Yugoton\" is a Polish tribute album to the former Yugoslav rock scene released in 2001. Its title is a nod to Jugoton.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":24},{"uri":"Chain_store","surface_form":"chain","offset":41},{"uri":"Record_store","surface_form":"record store","offset":47},{"uri":"Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"Yugoslavia","offset":74},{"uri":"Zagreb","surface_form":"Zagreb","offset":94},{"uri":"SR_Croatia","surface_form":"SR Croatia","offset":102},{"uri":"Yugoslav_pop_and_rock","surface_form":"Yugoslav pop and rock","offset":214},{"uri":"Croatia_Records","surface_form":"Croatia Records","offset":395},{"uri":"Paket_aran%C5%BEman","surface_form":"Paket aran\u017Eman","offset":482},{"uri":"Yugoslavia_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest","surface_form":"Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest","offset":529},{"uri":"Eurovision_Song_Contest_1989","surface_form":"1989","offset":611},{"uri":"Riva_(band)","surface_form":"Riva","offset":624},{"uri":"Popular_music","surface_form":"popular music","offset":774},{"uri":"Rick_Astley","surface_form":"Rick Astley","offset":803},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":816},{"uri":"David_Bowie","surface_form":"David Bowie","offset":829},{"uri":"Kate_Bush","surface_form":"Kate Bush","offset":842},{"uri":"Deep_Purple","surface_form":"Deep Purple","offset":853},{"uri":"Eurythmics","surface_form":"Eurythmics","offset":866},{"uri":"Iron_Maiden","surface_form":"Iron Maiden","offset":878},{"uri":"Kraftwerk","surface_form":"Kraftwerk","offset":891},{"uri":"John_Lennon","surface_form":"John Lennon","offset":902},{"uri":"Madonna_(entertainer)","surface_form":"Madonna","offset":915},{"uri":"Gary_Moore","surface_form":"Gary Moore","offset":924},{"uri":"M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe","surface_form":"M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe","offset":936},{"uri":"Elvis_Presley","surface_form":"Elvis Presley","offset":949},{"uri":"Pink_Floyd","surface_form":"Pink Floyd","offset":964},{"uri":"Public_Image_Limited","surface_form":"Public Image Limited","offset":976},{"uri":"Queen_(band)","surface_form":"Queen","offset":998},{"uri":"The_Rolling_Stones","surface_form":"The Rolling Stones","offset":1005},{"uri":"Scorpions_(band)","surface_form":"Scorpions","offset":1025},{"uri":"U2","surface_form":"U2","offset":1036},{"uri":"Whitesnake","surface_form":"Whitesnake","offset":1040},{"uri":"Kim_Wilde","surface_form":"Kim Wilde","offset":1052},{"uri":"Major_label","surface_form":"major label","offset":1093},{"uri":"PGP-RTB","surface_form":"PGP-RTB","offset":1167},{"uri":"Jugodisk","surface_form":"Jugodisk","offset":1179},{"uri":"Belgrade","surface_form":"Belgrade","offset":1193},{"uri":"Suzy_(record_label)","surface_form":"Suzy","offset":1203},{"uri":"Diskoton","surface_form":"Diskoton","offset":1221},{"uri":"Sarajevo","surface_form":"Sarajevo","offset":1235},{"uri":"ZKP_RTLJ","surface_form":"ZKP RTLJ","offset":1245},{"uri":"Ljubljana","surface_form":"Ljubljana","offset":1259},{"uri":"Yugonostalgia","surface_form":"Yugonostalgia","offset":1383},{"uri":"Shopping_mall","surface_form":"shopping mall","offset":1449},{"uri":"Skopje","surface_form":"Skopje","offset":1466},{"uri":"North_Macedonia","surface_form":"North Macedonia","offset":1502},{"uri":"Online_radio","surface_form":"online radio","offset":1646},{"uri":"Web_tv","surface_form":"web tv","offset":1663},{"uri":"Diaspora","surface_form":"diaspora","offset":1724},{"uri":"Vienna","surface_form":"Vienna","offset":1736},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":1744},{"uri":"Former_Yugoslavia","surface_form":"former Yugoslavia","offset":1777},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":1868},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":1873},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk","offset":1882},{"uri":"Tribute_album","surface_form":"tribute album","offset":2071},{"uri":"Yugoslav_rock","surface_form":"Yugoslav rock","offset":2099}]}
