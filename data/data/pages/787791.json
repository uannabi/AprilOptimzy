{"id":787791,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese","text":"e=\"preserve\">On March 13, 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was stabbed outside the apartment building on Austin Street, in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens in New York City.\nTwo weeks after the murder, \"The New York Times\" published an article claiming that 38 witnesses saw or heard the attack, and that none of them called the police or came to her aid, that witness as Sophia Farrar.\nThe incident was the bystander effect or \"Genovese syndrome\", and the murder became a well known example of U.S. psychology textbooks. Genovese syndrome is when witnesses to a crime to not report a crime because they are scare and they believe that others will report it instead which in the end they do not and the crime goes unreported.\nPolice interviews revealed that witnesses either attempted to call the police or were afraid to be involved.\nWinston Moseley, a 29-year-old Manhattan native, was arrested during a house burglary six days after the murder. While in custody, he confessed to killing Genovese. At his trial, Moseley was found guilty. Moseley died in prison on March 28, 2016.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kew_Gardens%2C_Queens","surface_form":"Kew Gardens","offset":127},{"uri":"Queens","surface_form":"Queens","offset":155},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":165},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":209},{"uri":"Bystander_effect","surface_form":"bystander effect","offset":414}]}
