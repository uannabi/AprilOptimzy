{"id":787962,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_reproduction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Plant reproduction is the production of new plants. It can be done by sexual or asexual reproduction.\nPlants have ways they may get clones of the parent plant. Any piece of a plant \"may\" be used to grow a whole plant. This is called vegetative reproduction.\nThese are all natural methods of vegetative reproduction. Also there are many ways in which humans can get copies (clones) of a plant, mainly by taking \"cuttings\" and using grafting.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":57},{"uri":"Asexual_reproduction","surface_form":"asexual","offset":93},{"uri":"Clones","surface_form":"clones","offset":145},{"uri":"Grafting","surface_form":"grafting","offset":444}]}
