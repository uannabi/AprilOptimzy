{"id":7880,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger","text":"Nigger is a word which refers to black people. Today, it is often treated as a racist insult, as often compared to \"nigga\" used in pop culture slang. Before the early 1900s, the word \"nigger\" was simply used to mean a black person (from negro) and was not considered racist, while the old term \"black\" was disliked and replaced with the word \"colored\" and later, with the wider covering term \"people of color\". In the United States the slur is mainly used by white supremacists as a prejudicial to African Americans of slave origin.\nThe word came from a slang pronunciation of \"negro\", which is the word for the color black in Spanish and for black people in Portuguese. Writers such as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain,\nand Charles Dickens used it. When they used the word, they meant \"black person\". \"Nigger\" was usually used in the Southern part of the United States, where blacks were at one time kept as slaves.\nToday, the word is an offensive racial slur in English, and is often considered to be hate speech. \"Nigger\" has become so taboo in the United States that some people don't use the word; they instead call it the \"N-word\".\nPop culture.\nBack in the 1980s and 90s, the word was used by many hip hop artists, one of them was NWA, which stands for \u2018Niggers with attitudes\u2019. Their 1988 single \u2018Straight Outta Compton\u2019 used the word, which made the group\u2019s other hits controversial. One being \u2018F**k Tha Police\u2019, which showed the group didn\u2019t like the police. Other rappers, such as XXXTentacion, real name Jahseh Dwayne Richardo Onfroy, used the word in most of his tracks, one of them being \u2018Bad Vibes Forever\u2019, released in 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racist","offset":79},{"uri":"Nigga","surface_form":"nigga","offset":116},{"uri":"Pop_culture","surface_form":"pop culture","offset":131},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":418},{"uri":"White_supremacy","surface_form":"white supremacists","offset":459},{"uri":"African_Americans","surface_form":"African Americans","offset":498},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":554},{"uri":"Black","surface_form":"black","offset":618},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":627},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":659},{"uri":"Joseph_Conrad","surface_form":"Joseph Conrad","offset":687},{"uri":"Mark_Twain","surface_form":"Mark Twain","offset":702},{"uri":"Charles_Dickens","surface_form":"Charles Dickens","offset":718},{"uri":"Slavery","surface_form":"slaves","offset":902},{"uri":"Slur","surface_form":"slur","offset":949},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":957},{"uri":"Hate_speech","surface_form":"hate speech","offset":996},{"uri":"Taboo","surface_form":"taboo","offset":1032},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1045},{"uri":"Hip_hop","surface_form":"hip hop","offset":1197},{"uri":"XXXTentacion","surface_form":"XXXTentacion","offset":1484}]}
