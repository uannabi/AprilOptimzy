As he lands on the shore he meets the figure of Death in person. This is the scene of a famous chess-playing episode where the two play for the knight's soul. The game is unfinished. After bargaining with Death for a while, the knight sets out on his travels. The travels show the damage done by the plague to all aspects of life in the country. To some critics, the film is typical of the existentialist films of the mid-20th century.\nThe knight is the gaunt figure of Max von Sydow at the start of his long film career. He was one of the actors whose career started with working for the film's producer Ingmar Bergman.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ingmar_Bergman","surface_form":"Ingmar Bergman","offset":72},{"uri":"Max_von_Sydow","surface_form":"Max von Sydow","offset":124},{"uri":"Gunnar_Bj%C3%B6rnstrand","surface_form":"Gunnar Bj\u00F6rnstrand","offset":139},{"uri":"Bengt_Ekerot","surface_form":"Bengt Ekerot","offset":159},{"uri":"Nils_Poppe","surface_form":"Nils Poppe","offset":173},{"uri":"Inga_Landgr%C3%A9","surface_form":"Inga Landgr\u00E9","offset":185},{"uri":"Bibi_Andersson","surface_form":"Bibi Andersson","offset":199},{"uri":"%C3%85ke_Fridell","surface_form":"\u00C5ke Fridell","offset":215},{"uri":"Inga_Gill","surface_form":"Inga Gill","offset":228},{"uri":"Black_Death","surface_form":"Black Death","offset":316},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":352},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":366},{"uri":"Existentialist","surface_form":"existentialist","offset":769},{"uri":"Max_von_Sydow","surface_form":"Max von Sydow","offset":849}]}
