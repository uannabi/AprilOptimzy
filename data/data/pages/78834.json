{"id":78834,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana","text":"Carmina Burana is the name given to a collection of texts from the 11th and 12th century. There are over 240 texts in the collection, most of them written in Latin, some in Middle High German. Most of the texts are moral or satirical in nature. There are also texts about spring, or about love. Some of them are drinking songs, some of them were used as Minnesang. Some of the songs contain hints for the melodies. For some, the melodies can be reconstructed.\nThe texts were written down around 1230. This happened either in an abbey in Styria, or near Brixen. They were discovered by Johann Christoph von Aretin in Benediktbeuern Abbey in 1803. Today, they are in the Bavarian State Library in Munich. There they can be found there as Codex Buranus, with the signature clm 4660/4660a.\nJohann Andreas Schmeller edited them and published them as \"Carmina Burana \u2013 Lieder aus Benediktbeuern\".\nCarl Orff took 24 of them as \"Carmina Burana\". He wrote the music for them. The work was first performed in 1937 in the Opera house in Frankfurt am Main. Together with his works \"Catulli Carmina\" and \"Trionfo di Afrodite\" he made a work containing all three, called \"Trionfi\". Trionfi is performed much less than the Carmina Burana alone, though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Text","surface_form":"text","offset":52},{"uri":"11th_century","surface_form":"11th","offset":67},{"uri":"12th_century","surface_form":"12th century","offset":76},{"uri":"Middle_High_German","surface_form":"Middle High German","offset":173},{"uri":"Moral","surface_form":"moral","offset":215},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":272},{"uri":"Love","surface_form":"love","offset":289},{"uri":"Drinking_song","surface_form":"drinking song","offset":312},{"uri":"Minnesang","surface_form":"Minnesang","offset":354},{"uri":"Abbey","surface_form":"abbey","offset":528},{"uri":"Styria","surface_form":"Styria","offset":537},{"uri":"Brixen","surface_form":"Brixen","offset":553},{"uri":"Johann_Christoph_von_Aretin","surface_form":"Johann Christoph von Aretin","offset":585},{"uri":"Benediktbeuern_Abbey","surface_form":"Benediktbeuern Abbey","offset":616},{"uri":"1803","surface_form":"1803","offset":640},{"uri":"Bavarian_State_Library","surface_form":"Bavarian State Library","offset":669},{"uri":"Munich","surface_form":"Munich","offset":695},{"uri":"Johann_Andreas_Schmeller","surface_form":"Johann Andreas Schmeller","offset":786},{"uri":"Carl_Orff","surface_form":"Carl Orff","offset":891},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":951},{"uri":"Opera_house","surface_form":"Opera house","offset":1011},{"uri":"Frankfurt_am_Main","surface_form":"Frankfurt am Main","offset":1026}]}
