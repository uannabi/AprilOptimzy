{"id":788384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiparticle","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term Quasiparticle describes a concept in physics in which energetically excited states in matter are treated as though they are elementary quantum particles in their own right.\u00A0 In fact they may be something less tangible like a vibration or\u00A0a rotation.\nUnlike neutrons, protons, or even atoms and molecules, quasiparticles aren't independent structures floating about on their own in free space but exist only within the structure being studied.\nFor the purposes of modelling the behaviour of the excited state within the structure this treatment works very well.\nAs the particles emerge from more fundamental structures they are called quasi-particles or quasiparticles.\nThese particles have in most cases short\u00A0 lifetimes, like the magnon or the exciton. But there are also some quasi-particles with an infinite lifetime like the cooper-pair in superconductors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":59},{"uri":"Matter","surface_form":"matter","offset":108},{"uri":"Quantum_mechanics","surface_form":"quantum","offset":157},{"uri":"Vibration","surface_form":"vibration","offset":247},{"uri":"Rotation","surface_form":"rotation","offset":262},{"uri":"Magnon","surface_form":"magnon","offset":753},{"uri":"Exciton","surface_form":"exciton","offset":767},{"uri":"Cooper-pair","surface_form":"cooper-pair","offset":851},{"uri":"Superconductor","surface_form":"superconductors","offset":866}]}
