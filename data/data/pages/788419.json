{"id":788419,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_function","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, a function maps an input value to an output value. In the case of a matrix function, the input and the output values are matrices. One example of a matrix function occurs with the Algebraic Riccati equation, which is used to solve certain optimal control problems.\nMatrix functions are special functions made by matrices.\nDefinitions.\nMost functions like formula_1 are defined as a solution of a differential equation. But matrix functions will use a different way.\nthen it is reasonable to define\nLet's use this idea.
