{"id":788565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_urbanism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Landscape urbanism is a new theory in the field of urban and regional planning that first appeared in the late 20th century claiming that the best way to organize cities is through the landscape design of the city rather than the design of its buildings. The phrase urban landscape first appeared in the mid-1990s. Since then this phrase has received many different uses but is most often cited as a post-modernist or post-modernist response to the failures of \"New Urbanism\".\nIn 2008 the first Biennale in the world of \"Landscape Urbanism\" was held in the city of Bat-Yam in Israel which dealt with New Urbanism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Urban_Planning","surface_form":"urban and regional planning","offset":64},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":124},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":321},{"uri":"New_Urbanism","surface_form":"New Urbanism","offset":475},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":493},{"uri":"Biennale","surface_form":"Biennale","offset":508},{"uri":"Bat-Yam","surface_form":"Bat-Yam","offset":578},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":589},{"uri":"New_Urbanism","surface_form":"New Urbanism","offset":613}]}
