{"id":78867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graub%C3%BCnden","text":"Graub\u00FCnden ' is the biggest and is farthest to the east of the cantons of Switzerland. The name means \"Gray Union\" in German and the canton lies entirely in the Alps. In Switzerland it hosts the biggest number of tourists each year.\nGeography.\nThe area of the canton is 7,105 km\u00B2. Only one third of this land is used for farming. Forests cover 20% of the total area. The canton has many mountains that make up the highlands of the Rhine and Inn river valleys. Many of its scenic areas are part of the Swiss National Park or the Ela Nature Park.\nThere are many important peaks in the Grison Alps, including the T\u00F6di at 3,614\u00A0meters and the highest peak Piz Bernina at 4,049\u00A0meters. Many of the mountain ranges feature huge glaciers, such as at the Adula, the Albula, the Silvretta, the Bernina, the Bregaglia and the R\u00E4tikon ranges. The mountain ranges in the central area contain many of the deepest vallies in Switzerland.\nThe canton borders Liechtenstein to the north, Austria to the north and the east, Italy to the south, and the cantons of St. Gallen to the northwest; Glarus and the canton of Uri to the west, and Ticino to the southwest. The capital city is Chur. Davos and St. Moritz are world-famous resorts and can be found in this area.\nHistory.\nMost of the lands of the canton were once part of a Roman province called \"Raetia\" that was established in 15 BC. The area later was part of the lands of the diocese at Chur.\nIn 1367 the League of God's House was founded against the power of the Bishop of Chur. This was followed by the making of the Grey League, sometimes called \"Oberbund\", in 1395 in the Upper Rhine valley. The name \"Grey League\" is derived from the homespun grey clothes worn by the people. The name of this league later gave its name to the canton of Graub\u00FCnden.\nThe first step towards the naming of the canton into Graub\u00FCnden was when the league of the Ten Jurisdictions allied with the League of God's House in 1450. In 1471, the two leagues aligned with the Grey League. This meant that the leagues allied with the Swiss Confederation. The Habsburgs were defeated at Calven Gorge and Dornach, helping the Swiss confederation and the allied leagues of the canton of Grisons to be recognized.\nThe last traces of the bishop of Chur's jurisdiction were abolished in 1526. The Musso war of the 1520 drove the Three Leagues closer to the Swiss Confederacy. The lands of the canton of Graub\u00FCnden were part of the Helvetic Republic, but the \"perpetual ally\" of Switzerland became a canton in 1803. The constitution of the canton dates from 1892.\nThe arms of the three original leagues are now all part of the coat of arms of the canton.\nPrivate cars were only allowed in the canton of Graub\u00FCnden after several votings in 1926.\nCulture.\nThe Graub\u00FCnden are known for a dried-beef delicacy called B\u00FCndnerfleisch and for a nut and honey pie known as B\u00FCndner Nusstorte. Another specialty, made mostly in the western part of Grison, is Capuns, a filling meal of pasta and a little bit of meat, rolled into Chard leaves, eventually baked in mode of a gratin with cheese.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture and tourism make up most of the canton's economy. Agriculture combines forests and mountain pasturage in summer, mostly beef but also sheep and goats. Tourism is all around the canton, mainly around the towns of Davos/Arosa, Flims and St. Moritz/Pontresina, which are important in both winter and summer. There are a great number of other resorts people visiting the country can go to in the canton.\nThere is wine production around the capital Chur. Chur is also the center of industry. In the southern valleys of Misox and Poschiavo there is corn (maize) and chestnut farming.\nDemographics.\nThe languages spoken in Graub\u00FCnden are German in the northwest, Romansh in the Engadin and around Must\u00E9r), and Standard Italian in the valleys Misox, Calanca, Val Bregaglia, and Poschiavo.\nThe main religions are Protestantism and Catholicism. Both are well-represented in the canton, with Roman Catholics forming a slight majority.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Canton"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"cantons","offset":63},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":74},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":161},{"uri":"1_E9_m%C2%B2","surface_form":"7,105 km\u00B2","offset":270},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":431},{"uri":"Inn_River","surface_form":"Inn","offset":441},{"uri":"Swiss_National_Park","surface_form":"Swiss National Park","offset":501},{"uri":"Ela_Nature_Park","surface_form":"Ela Nature Park","offset":528},{"uri":"Grison_Alps","surface_form":"Grison Alps","offset":583},{"uri":"T%C3%B6di","surface_form":"T\u00F6di","offset":610},{"uri":"Piz_Bernina","surface_form":"Piz Bernina","offset":652},{"uri":"Lepontine_Alps","surface_form":"Adula","offset":747},{"uri":"Albula_Range","surface_form":"Albula","offset":758},{"uri":"Silvretta","surface_form":"Silvretta","offset":770},{"uri":"Bernina_Range","surface_form":"Bernina","offset":785},{"uri":"Bregaglia_Range","surface_form":"Bregaglia","offset":798},{"uri":"R%C3%A4tikon","surface_form":"R\u00E4tikon","offset":816},{"uri":"Liechtenstein","surface_form":"Liechtenstein","offset":943},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":971},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1006},{"uri":"St._Gallen","surface_form":"St. Gallen","offset":1045},{"uri":"Glarus_(canton)","surface_form":"Glarus","offset":1074},{"uri":"Canton_of_Uri","surface_form":"canton of Uri","offset":1089},{"uri":"Ticino","surface_form":"Ticino","offset":1120},{"uri":"Chur","surface_form":"Chur","offset":1165},{"uri":"Davos","surface_form":"Davos","offset":1171},{"uri":"St._Moritz","surface_form":"St. Moritz","offset":1181},{"uri":"15_BC","surface_form":"15 BC","offset":1364},{"uri":"Diocese","surface_form":"diocese","offset":1415},{"uri":"Chur","surface_form":"Chur","offset":1426},{"uri":"1367","surface_form":"1367","offset":1435},{"uri":"League_of_God%27s_House","surface_form":"League of God's House","offset":1444},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Chur","surface_form":"Bishop of Chur","offset":1503},{"uri":"Grey_League","surface_form":"Grey League","offset":1558},{"uri":"1395","surface_form":"1395","offset":1603},{"uri":"1450","surface_form":"1450","offset":1943},{"uri":"1471","surface_form":"1471","offset":1952},{"uri":"Battle_of_Calven","surface_form":"Calven Gorge","offset":2100},{"uri":"Battle_of_Dornach","surface_form":"Dornach","offset":2117},{"uri":"1526","surface_form":"1526","offset":2295},{"uri":"Musso_war","surface_form":"Musso war","offset":2305},{"uri":"Helvetic_Republic","surface_form":"Helvetic Republic","offset":2439},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":2486},{"uri":"1803","surface_form":"1803","offset":2517},{"uri":"1892","surface_form":"1892","offset":2565},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"coat of arms","offset":2634},{"uri":"Voting","surface_form":"voting","offset":2735},{"uri":"B%C3%BCndnerfleisch","surface_form":"B\u00FCndnerfleisch","offset":2819},{"uri":"B%C3%BCndner_Nusstorte","surface_form":"B\u00FCndner Nusstorte","offset":2871},{"uri":"Capuns","surface_form":"Capuns","offset":2955},{"uri":"Chard","surface_form":"Chard","offset":3025},{"uri":"Davos","surface_form":"Davos","offset":3322},{"uri":"Arosa","surface_form":"Arosa","offset":3328},{"uri":"Flims","surface_form":"Flims","offset":3335},{"uri":"St._Moritz","surface_form":"St. Moritz","offset":3345},{"uri":"Pontresina","surface_form":"Pontresina","offset":3356},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":3519},{"uri":"Chur","surface_form":"Chur","offset":3554},{"uri":"Misox","surface_form":"Misox","offset":3624},{"uri":"Poschiavo","surface_form":"Poschiavo","offset":3634},{"uri":"Chestnut","surface_form":"chestnut","offset":3670},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":3741},{"uri":"Romansh","surface_form":"Romansh","offset":3766},{"uri":"Engadin","surface_form":"Engadin","offset":3781},{"uri":"Must%C3%A9r","surface_form":"Must\u00E9r","offset":3800},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Standard Italian","offset":3813},{"uri":"Val_Mesolcina","surface_form":"Misox","offset":3845},{"uri":"Calanca","surface_form":"Calanca","offset":3852},{"uri":"Bregaglia_Range","surface_form":"Val Bregaglia","offset":3861},{"uri":"Poschiavo","surface_form":"Poschiavo","offset":3880},{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestantism","offset":3914},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholicism","offset":3932}]}
