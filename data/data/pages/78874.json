{"id":78874,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Jura","text":"The canton of Jura is one of the Cantons of Switzerland. It is the newest of the 26 Swiss cantons (created in 1979) and is in the northwestern part of Switzerland. The capital is Del\u00E9mont. It shares borders with the canton of Basel-Landschaft, the Canton of Bern, and the French d\u00E9partement of Jura.\nGeography.\nCanton Jura is in northwest Switzerland. It includes parts of the Jura mountains in the south and the Jura plateau in the north. The Jura plateau is hilly and almost entirely limestone.\nTo the north and the west of Jura is France. The canton of Solothurn and Basel-Landschaft are east of Jura, while the canton of Bern is south of Jura. The River Doubs and the river Birs drain the lands.\nHistory.\nThe king of Burgundy donated much of the land that today makes up Canton Jura to the Bishop of Basel in 999. The area was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire for more than 800 years. After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 the Jura had close ties with the Swiss Confederation. In the Congress of Vienna the Jura was given to the Canton Bern. This act caused dissension. The Jura was French-speaking and Roman Catholic, whereas the canton of Bern was mostly German-speaking and Protestant. The people of the Jura region called for independence. After a long struggle, a constitution was accepted in 1977. In 1978 the split was made official when the Swiss people voted in favour of it, and in 1979 the Jura joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member. However, the southern part of the Jura region, which is also predominantly French-speaking but has a Protestant majority, opted not to join the newly formed canton, and instead remained part of Bern. This area is now known as Bernese Jura. The word Jura, therefore, may refer either to Canton Jura, or to the combined territory of Canton Jura and Bernese Jura.\nOn creation, the canton adopted the title Republic and Canton of the Jura. Other cantons in Switzerland using the title \"Republic and Canton\" are Ticino, Canton Geneva, and Canton Neuch\u00E2tel. In each case the title asserts the autonomy of the canton and its nominal sovereignty within the Swiss Confederation.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is important in Canton Jura. Cattle breeding is significant and there is also horse breeding. The main industries are watches, clothing and tobacco. There are a growing number of small and middle-sized businesses.\nPeople.\nThe people are almost fully French-speaking. The majority is Roman Catholic.\nMunicipalities.\nThis is a list of the canton's 83 municipalities by district.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"Cantons of Switzerland","offset":33},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":151},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":168},{"uri":"Del%C3%A9mont","surface_form":"Del\u00E9mont","offset":179},{"uri":"Basel-Landschaft","surface_form":"Basel-Landschaft","offset":226},{"uri":"Canton_of_Bern","surface_form":"Canton of Bern","offset":248},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":272},{"uri":"Jura_(departement)","surface_form":"Jura","offset":294},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":339},{"uri":"Jura_mountains","surface_form":"Jura mountains","offset":377},{"uri":"Limestone","surface_form":"limestone","offset":486},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":534},{"uri":"Canton_of_Solothurn","surface_form":"canton of Solothurn","offset":546},{"uri":"Basel-Landschaft","surface_form":"Basel-Landschaft","offset":570},{"uri":"Canton_of_Bern","surface_form":"canton of Bern","offset":615},{"uri":"River_Doubs","surface_form":"River Doubs","offset":652},{"uri":"Birs","surface_form":"Birs","offset":678},{"uri":"King_of_Burgundy","surface_form":"king of Burgundy","offset":713},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Basel","surface_form":"Bishop of Basel","offset":794},{"uri":"999","surface_form":"999","offset":813},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":860},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Westphalia","surface_form":"Treaty of Westphalia","offset":913},{"uri":"1648","surface_form":"1648","offset":937},{"uri":"Congress_of_Vienna","surface_form":"Congress of Vienna","offset":1003},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":1102},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":1122},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":1176},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":1196},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":1317},{"uri":"1978","surface_form":"1978","offset":1326},{"uri":"1979","surface_form":"1979","offset":1411},{"uri":"Protestant","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":1575},{"uri":"Bernese_Jura","surface_form":"Bernese Jura","offset":1700},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1927},{"uri":"Ticino","surface_form":"Ticino","offset":1981},{"uri":"Canton_of_Geneva","surface_form":"Canton Geneva","offset":1989},{"uri":"Canton_of_Neuch%C3%A2tel","surface_form":"Canton Neuch\u00E2tel","offset":2008},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"Agriculture","offset":2153},{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"Cattle","offset":2194},{"uri":"Horse_breeding","surface_form":"horse breeding","offset":2243},{"uri":"Watch","surface_form":"watch","offset":2283},{"uri":"Clothing","surface_form":"clothing","offset":2292},{"uri":"Tobacco","surface_form":"tobacco","offset":2305},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":2514}]}
