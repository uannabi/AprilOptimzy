{"id":78880,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Community","text":"=\"preserve\">The French Community () was the body which replaced the French Union in 1958. Under the 1958 Constitution, member territories, former French colonies, had a lot of independence, but France controlled the currency, defence, foreign affairs and national security.\nWhen the Community was established, French President de Gaulle said that any country in the French Community could move to complete independence. Apart from Guinea, which chose by referendum in 1958 not to join the Community, all French-ruled territories in sub-Saharan Africa joined the French Community. They obtained independence in 1960.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_Union","surface_form":"French Union","offset":68},{"uri":"Constitution_of_France","surface_form":"1958 Constitution","offset":100},{"uri":"Colonies","surface_form":"colonies","offset":153},{"uri":"Decolonization","surface_form":"independence","offset":176},{"uri":"Charles_de_Gaulle","surface_form":"de Gaulle","offset":327},{"uri":"Guinea","surface_form":"Guinea","offset":431},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":454},{"uri":"Sub-Saharan_Africa","surface_form":"sub-Saharan Africa","offset":532}]}
