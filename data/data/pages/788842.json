{"id":788842,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_paradox","text":"Pressure in liquids is equally divided in all directions, therefore if a force is applied to one point of the liquid, it will be transmitted to all other points within the liquid.\nWater exerts an upward force on the object and that upward force is known as buoyancy. Any object immersed in the fluid experiences buoyancy.\nLiquid pressure is exerted on the surface of an object in a liquid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
