{"id":78895,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegrass_music","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music. It has its own roots in Irish, Scottish and English traditional music. It is usually played using acoustic musical instruments, and electronic musical instruments are rarely used in bluegrass music. Traditional instruments used include the banjo, mandolin, fiddle, guitar and bass. Other instruments such as the dobro are also used.\nThere are many accomplished bluegrass artists including Bela Fleck, Tony Rice, Alison Krauss, Laurie Lewis, Sam Bush, Bill Monroe, and Earl Scruggs. There are many organizations devoted to this music such as the International Bluegrass Music Association [http://www.ibma.org/ (IBMA).]\nMany festivals are held around the country where professionals perform, amateurs gather to play, and workshops are given.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":42},{"uri":"Roots_music","surface_form":"roots music","offset":51},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":88},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":95},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"English","offset":108},{"uri":"Acoustic_music","surface_form":"acoustic","offset":162},{"uri":"Musical_instrument","surface_form":"musical instrument","offset":171},{"uri":"Electronic_music","surface_form":"electronic","offset":196},{"uri":"Banjo","surface_form":"banjo","offset":304},{"uri":"Mandolin","surface_form":"mandolin","offset":311},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"fiddle, guitar","offset":321},{"uri":"Bass_(instrument)","surface_form":"bass","offset":340},{"uri":"Bela_Fleck","surface_form":"Bela Fleck","offset":453},{"uri":"Tony_Rice","surface_form":"Tony Rice","offset":465},{"uri":"Alison_Krauss","surface_form":"Alison Krauss","offset":476}]}
