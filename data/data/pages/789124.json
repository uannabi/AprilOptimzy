{"id":789124,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungguy_frog","text":"The jungguy frog (\"Ranoidea jungguy\") is a tree frog from Australia. It lives in Queensland.\nThis frog lives in rainforests near the Barron River and east to the Mirray River. Some of these frogs also live near the Broken River.\nThe adult male frog is 3.1 to 4.8 cm long and the adult female frog is 4.4 to 7.1 cm long. This frog is light brown with darker brown marks. Some males turn partially yellow during the time of year when they try to attract females. The front feet have no webbing and large discs for climbing.\nIn some places, this frog digs a small basin to lay eggs in. The tadpoles stay in this basin until they become frogs. The frog digs the basin in sandy ground where the sunlight comes through the trees. The frog digs the basin close enough to a stream for water to seep through the sand into the basin. In some species, a male frog digs a basin to impress a female so she will mate with him, but scientists think male jungguy frogs attract a female first and then dig the basin.\nScientists used to think this was the same frog as \"Litoria lesueuri\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":43},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":58},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":81},{"uri":"Litoria_lesueuri","surface_form":"Litoria lesueuri","offset":1052}]}
