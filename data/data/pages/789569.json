A stormy display of feelings was accepted in the family. The atmosphere of childhood influenced the formation of Catherine's personality, having already become a famous actress, Klimova was distinguished by a strong-willed, wayward character and expressive behavior both in her personal life and on the set.\nAfter graduating from secondary school, Ekaterina entered preparatory courses at VGIK. In 1999 she graduated with honors from the acting faculty of the Higher Theater School named after M. FROM. Shchepkina (workshop N. N.

K. \", in the TV series \" Poor Nastya \", \" Escape \", \" Boiling Point \". One of the most memorable was the role of the nurse Nina Polyakova, played by Klimova in the dilogy \"We are from the future\" (films \" We are from the future \" and \" We are from the future 2 \"). In this film, Klimova sang the romance \" \"Thank you for everything, good friend...\" \" to the poems of Elizabeth Stewart, which became widely popular and very soon turned out to be prophetic for the actress. The timbre of Klimova's voice was assessed by musicologists as soft, velvety, unusually warm.

Professional Cup \".\nIn 2012, in the alcoholic-romantic comedy \"Date\" directed by Yusup Bakhshiyev, Klimova appears as a sexy teacher, a very teetotaler, \"clever and beautiful woman with long legs from under a small fuchsia dress.\" The observer of the Gazeta.ru publication drew attention to the inability to tempt the heroine of Catherine with palaces and diamonds, noted the actress in the scene of rental on a motorcycle across all Moscow, lying on a frame with her back and with outstretched legs. The film itself is rated as an epigonic eclectic with a set of disparate, impressive episodes based on the American film Blind Date (1987) with Bruce Willis and the prototype of Klimova performed by Kim Basinger.\nIn 2013 she played one of the main roles - a successful and successful TV presenter in the film \"Season Icon\". Klimova's character is a typical glamorous inhabitant of glossy worlds, idly wandering from one fashionable party to another, but rapidly transforming with the appearance of a real strong feeling in life.\nIn 2013-2014, she starred in Lviv in the adventure spy series by S. Ginzburg \" Wolf Sun \", which, based on historical events, takes place in the early 1920s on the border of Soviet Ukraine and Poland.

According to critics, Klimova piercingly and authentically conveyed the inner essence of the frustrating character of Raisa Peterson; The strong side of the image of a young, but already experienced seducer in a duet with the romantic Nikita Efremov was the unbridled passionarity characteristic of the actress, the burning play of the eyes, sensual sign language and almost ballet plasticity. In the scene of the officers' picnic, Ekaterina performed a rarely-heard romance by E.

When creating an artistic image of a lady-in-waiting, who is neither internally nor externally similar to herself, an important acting task for Klimova was not to distort the fate and character of the real person, who left a mark on the chronicles. The script for the film was based, in particular, on the diaries of Klimova's character, Anna Vyrubova. In the frame, Catherine wears genuine 19th-century shoes, her dresses and costumes were sewn according to old patterns. The most valuable, historically convincing acting works of the film, embodying the strength and indomitability of the Russian spirit, are recognized as the roles of Klimova and the \u201CSiberian elder\u201D (Vladimir Mashkov), permeated with passion and dramatic intensity (Vladimir Mashkov).\nIn the second half of 2014, Klimova starred in Ukraine in the melodrama Women in Love and the battle drama According to the Laws of War, which takes place during the German invasion of Kiev in the summer and autumn of 1941, the actress plays the role of a special department investigator...

As of 2019, an entreprise performance, performed once a month in different cities of Russia, is sold out.\nKlimova calls her favorite director Andrei Malyukov, who entrusted her with such diverse roles as nurse Nina (\"We are from the future\"), Anna Vyrubova (TV series about Rasputin), Raisa Peterson (TV series Kuprin). However, critically it noted that the choice of roles for Catherine is based primarily on the exterior attractiveness of the character, and when required to \"jump out of the trench, crawling under bullets and undermined by a mine\",\" then the performance stunts Klimov duplicates professional kaskadorsha.\nThe initial prototype, \"secretly involved\" in the gallery of roles of fatal, insidious and seductive women played by the actress, Klimova called the image of Milady from \"The Three Musketeers \".\nAmong the actors who influenced her, Ekaterina especially singles out Vladimir Mashkov, Ingeborga Dapkunaite, Andrey Smolyakov.\nIn an interview in 2015, Klimova regretted that she had not become an actress of the festival cinema.
