Internet memes are usually created when someone published something and that thing was shared widely over the Internet. They usually consist of an image with top and bottom text. While spreading over the internet, most internet memes 'evolve' over time, with the original image/video being changed in one way or another by people other than the creator. Every internet meme evolves and has many variants. See: Memes\nTwo other versions of Internet memes are \"dank memes\" and \"dead memes\". Dank memes are thought of as relevant and funny. Dead memes are thought of as not relevant, or not funny. Dead memes, however, can become dank memes if used properly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Meme","surface_form":"Meme","offset":47},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"internet","offset":97},{"uri":"Image","surface_form":"image","offset":117},{"uri":"Video","surface_form":"video","offset":126},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"even a person","offset":136},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"published","offset":199},{"uri":"Meme","surface_form":"Memes","offset":561}]}
