{"id":789981,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pygmy_shrew","text":"The American pygmy shrew (\"Sorex hoyi\") is a type of shrew. It found in Northern Alaska, Canada, and the northern and southern United States.\nIt is found in northern coniferous and deciduous forests of North America. It is believed to be the second-smallest mammal in the world. Because of its fast metabolism, it is always eating.\nDescription.\nThe American pygmy shrew is the smallest mammal native to North America. Its is about 5 cm (2 in) long. It weighs about 2.0 to 4.5 g (0.07 to 0.16 oz). Its fur is reddish or grayish brown during the summer. It is white-gray during the winter. It molts about two times a year. It has a narrow head with a pointed nose, and whiskers. The eyes are small.\nDistribution.\nThey are found from Northern Alaska, to the Rocky Mountains. They are also found from the Great Lakes region, to the Appalachians, to the eastern side of Canada. Even though the American pygmy shrew prefers wet habitats, it has been seen in places with both wet and dry soil.\nFeeding.\nIt mainly eats insects and insect larvae, and worms. To stay alive, the American pygmy shrew has to eat every 15 to 30 minutes, day and night.\nPredators.\nPredators of the American pygmy shrew include hawks, brook trout, owls, snakes, and domestic cats.\nReproduction.\nLittle is known about the reproduction of American pygmy shrews. They appear to mate all year round. The gestation period is estimated to be 18 days. Females give birth to three to eight young ones. They usually leave the family at the age of 25 days. The maximum lifespan of an American pygmy shrew is believed to be about 16\u201317 months.\nBehavior.\nPygmy shrews dig through soil to look for food. They can use tunnel made by other animals to help them look for food. They do not sleep or rest for a long time. They have great senses of smell and hearing to help them find their food.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shrew","surface_form":"shrew","offset":53},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":81},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":89},{"uri":"Northern_United_States","surface_form":"northern","offset":105},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"southern United States","offset":118},{"uri":"Conifer","surface_form":"coniferous","offset":166},{"uri":"Deciduous","surface_form":"deciduous","offset":181},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forests","offset":191},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":202},{"uri":"Its","surface_form":"its","offset":290},{"uri":"Metabolism","surface_form":"metabolism","offset":299},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":403},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":501},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":544},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":580},{"uri":"Moulting","surface_form":"molts","offset":591},{"uri":"Whisker","surface_form":"whiskers","offset":667},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":755},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":801},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":813},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":865},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitats","offset":922},{"uri":"Soil","surface_form":"soil","offset":981},{"uri":"Larva","surface_form":"larvae","offset":1030},{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":1124},{"uri":"Night","surface_form":"night","offset":1132},{"uri":"Hawk","surface_form":"hawks","offset":1196},{"uri":"Brook_trout","surface_form":"brook trout","offset":1203},{"uri":"Owl","surface_form":"owls","offset":1216},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snakes","offset":1222},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"domestic cats","offset":1234},{"uri":"Gestation","surface_form":"gestation period","offset":1368},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":1741},{"uri":"Sensory_system","surface_form":"senses","offset":1788},{"uri":"Smell","surface_form":"smell","offset":1798},{"uri":"Hearing","surface_form":"hearing","offset":1808}]}
