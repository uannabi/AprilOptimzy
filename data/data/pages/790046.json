It is believed to be extinct in Alabama.\nThe eastern indigo snake was extinct in northern Florida because of habitat loss and fragmentation. The eastern indigo snake was last seen in Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve in 1982, until 2017 when 12 snakes were released as part of a conservation program. 20 more snakes were released in 2018. 15 snakes in 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Colubrid","surface_form":"Colubridae","offset":81},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":174},{"uri":"Non-venomous_snake","surface_form":"non-venomous snake","offset":259},{"uri":"Southeastern_United_States","surface_form":"southeastern United States","offset":285},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":697},{"uri":"South","surface_form":"south","offset":712},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":726},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":755},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":780},{"uri":"Flatwoods","surface_form":"flatwoods","offset":824},{"uri":"Hammock_(ecology)","surface_form":"hammocks","offset":835},{"uri":"Glade_(geography)","surface_form":"glades","offset":849},{"uri":"Stream_bed","surface_form":"stream bottoms","offset":857},{"uri":"Sugarcane","surface_form":"sugarcane","offset":873},{"uri":"Riparian_zone","surface_form":"riparian","offset":891},{"uri":"Thicket","surface_form":"thickets","offset":900},{"uri":"Sandy_soil","surface_form":"sandy soils","offset":914},{"uri":"Scrubland","surface_form":"scrublands","offset":968},{"uri":"Longleaf_pine","surface_form":"longleaf pine","offset":1051},{"uri":"Southern_live_oak","surface_form":"southern live oak","offset":1066},{"uri":"Laurel_oak","surface_form":"laurel oak","offset":1085},{"uri":"Chapman_oak","surface_form":"Chapman oak","offset":1097},{"uri":"Myrtle_oak","surface_form":"myrtle oak","offset":1114},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":1171},{"uri":"Turtle","surface_form":"turtle","offset":1179},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizard","offset":1188},{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":1197},{"uri":"Toad","surface_form":"toad","offset":1204},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"bird","offset":1225},{"uri":"Mammal","surface_form":"mammal","offset":1235},{"uri":"Egg","surface_form":"egg","offset":1248},{"uri":"Oviparous_animals","surface_form":"oviparous","offset":1296},{"uri":"Habitat_destruction","surface_form":"habitat loss","offset":1553},{"uri":"Habitat_fragmentation","surface_form":"fragmentation","offset":1693},{"uri":"Apalachicola_Bluffs_and_Ravines_Preserve","surface_form":"Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve","offset":1750}]}
