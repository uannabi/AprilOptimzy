{"id":790051,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altersex","text":"e=\"preserve\">Altersex (composed of \"alter\" and \"sex\") is an umbrella term for a different or other possibility referring to primary and secondary sexual characteristics, such as genitalia and gonads, phenotype and genotype (genetics/karyotype).\nAltersexuality was created to be used on a large scale, but not exclusively, for fictional characters, describing body plans that are a mixture of things, instead of naturally found configurations, such as salmacian (ambigenital or bigenital) or bigonadal (ovotestis).\nA body plan is the type of body parts that someone has or does not have, such as a penis, testicles, a vulva, a developed clitoris and breasts, similar to transsexuality in these cases, altersexuals can get sex reassignment surgery, also popularly known as change of sex, such as (vulvo)vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, methoidioplasty or (peno)scrotoplasty. However altersexo is a type category of any body plane outside the conventional standard, including those that are fantastic or imaginary and, or physiologically not possible in real life or in the homo sapiens species.\nThe word has been adopted by transgender people in gender non-conformity, as they do not belong to the dyadic / dualistic and cissexual pattern of endosex (non- intersex or perisex), making it an alternative to denote dissent towards sex cisnormative classifications biological and anatomical, constantly socialized by identity genres.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Secondary_sex_characteristic","surface_form":"secondary","offset":136},{"uri":"Sex_organ","surface_form":"genitalia","offset":178},{"uri":"Gonad","surface_form":"gonads","offset":192},{"uri":"Phenotype","surface_form":"phenotype","offset":200},{"uri":"Genotype","surface_form":"genotype","offset":214},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetics","offset":224},{"uri":"Karyotype","surface_form":"karyotype","offset":233},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional characters","offset":326},{"uri":"Body_plan","surface_form":"body plans","offset":359},{"uri":"Ovotestis","surface_form":"ovotestis","offset":502},{"uri":"Penis","surface_form":"penis","offset":597},{"uri":"Testicle","surface_form":"testicles","offset":604},{"uri":"Vulva","surface_form":"vulva","offset":617},{"uri":"Clitoris","surface_form":"clitoris","offset":636},{"uri":"Transsexual","surface_form":"transsexuality","offset":669},{"uri":"Sexual_reassignment_surgery","surface_form":"sex reassignment surgery","offset":721},{"uri":"Vaginoplasty","surface_form":"(vulvo)vaginoplasty","offset":794},{"uri":"Phalloplasty","surface_form":"phalloplasty","offset":815},{"uri":"Methoidioplasty","surface_form":"methoidioplasty","offset":829},{"uri":"Physiology","surface_form":"physiologically","offset":1014},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"homo sapiens","offset":1066},{"uri":"Transgender","surface_form":"transgender","offset":1117},{"uri":"Gender_non-compliance","surface_form":"gender non-conformity","offset":1139},{"uri":"Cisgender","surface_form":"cissexual pattern","offset":1214},{"uri":"Intersexuality","surface_form":"intersex","offset":1249},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"sex","offset":1322},{"uri":"Transphobia","surface_form":"cisnormative","offset":1326},{"uri":"Sex","surface_form":"biological","offset":1355},{"uri":"Anatomy","surface_form":"anatomical","offset":1370},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"genres","offset":1416}]}
