{"id":790257,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae","text":"The lumbar vertebrae in humans are the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis.\nThey are important parts of the vertebral column. They are called L1 to L5, starting at the top. The lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the body, and allow movement. In particular, they connect to the pelvis.\nMost people have five lumbar vertebrae, but some have four or six. Not much movement takes place between the lumbar vertebrae.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vertebrae","surface_form":"vertebrae","offset":44},{"uri":"Rib_cage","surface_form":"rib cage","offset":66},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":83},{"uri":"Vertebral_column","surface_form":"vertebral column","offset":123},{"uri":"Pelvis","surface_form":"pelvis","offset":301}]}
