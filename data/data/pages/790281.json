W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. This aimed to encourage support for recovery efforts for Hurricane Harvey, but was then extended to include areas most affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\nThe appeal was launched when the five former Presidents aired a joint PSA on the NFL\u2019s regular season opening broadcast.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"U.S._President","surface_form":"U.S. President","offset":134},{"uri":"Jimmy_Carter","surface_form":"Jimmy Carter","offset":151},{"uri":"George_H._W._Bush","surface_form":"George H.
