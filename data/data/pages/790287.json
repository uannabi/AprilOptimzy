They were brought together by Nelson Mandela in 2007. They describe themselves as \"independent global leaders working together for peace and human rights\".\nThe goal Mandela set for the Elders was to use their \"almost 1,000 years of collective experience\" to work on solutions for controversial and long-lasting problems such as climate change, AIDS, and poverty, as well as to \"use their political independence to help resolve some of the world's most intractable conflicts\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Public_figure","surface_form":"public figure","offset":77},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"statesmen","offset":107},{"uri":"Peace_activist","surface_form":"peace activist","offset":118},{"uri":"Human_rights_activists","surface_form":"human rights advocates","offset":139},{"uri":"Nelson_Mandela","surface_form":"Nelson Mandela","offset":193},{"uri":"Global_warming","surface_form":"climate change","offset":491},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":507},{"uri":"Group_conflict","surface_form":"conflicts","offset":627}]}
