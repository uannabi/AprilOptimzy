{"id":790348,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main%27s_frog","text":"Main's water-holding frog, Main's frog, the sheep frog or western collared frog (\"Ranoidea maini\") is a frog from Australia. It lives in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia.\nThis frog can live on flood plains, claypans, grassland and wetlands that dry up. It lays eggs whenever there is enough water, and the tadpoles grow into frogs quickly.\nThis frog is 5.0 cm long with a round body. The skin on its back is gray or brown with darker marks. Some frogs can change the color of their skin, making it much lighter in color in a few hours. Their front feet are not webbed, and their hind feet are webbed about halfway.\nThis frog is named after frog scientist Albert Main.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":104},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":114},{"uri":"Northern_Territory","surface_form":"Northern Territory","offset":141},{"uri":"South_Australia","surface_form":"South Australia","offset":161},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":181},{"uri":"Flood_plain","surface_form":"flood plain","offset":222},{"uri":"Claypan","surface_form":"claypan","offset":236},{"uri":"Grassland","surface_form":"grassland","offset":246},{"uri":"Herpetology","surface_form":"frog scientist","offset":669}]}
