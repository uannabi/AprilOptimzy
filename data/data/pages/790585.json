{"id":790585,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuranda_tree_frog","text":"The Kuranda tree frog (\"Ranoidea myola\") is a frog from Australia. It lives in Queensland. Scientists have only seen it near the Barron River.\nThe adult male frog is 3.5 to 4.5 cm long and the adult female frog is 5.7 to 6.9 cm long. They can be brown, tan, gray or a mix of these with darker brown or green marks. The female frog spends most of her time in trees and the male frog spends most of his time near streams.\nThis frog is endangered because of habitat loss, because of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, because of predators brought from other places and because of competition from a similar frog, the green-eyed tree frog.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":46},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":56},{"uri":"Queensland","surface_form":"Queensland","offset":79},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":455},{"uri":"Chytridiomycosis","surface_form":"chytridiomycosis","offset":499},{"uri":"Invasive_species","surface_form":"predators brought from other places","offset":528},{"uri":"Green-eyed_tree_frog","surface_form":"green-eyed tree frog","offset":616}]}
