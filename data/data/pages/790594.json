This genus of sunflowers has a huge number of species over ten thousand species and subspecies.\nSome experts split it up into two genera: what is here treated as the single genus \"Hieracium\" is treated by some European experts as two genera, \"Hieracium\" and \"Pilosella\".\nLike all members of the family, hawkweeds have tightly packed flowerheads made of many small flowers. They reproduce asexually by seeds which are genetically identical to those of the mother plant.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":34},{"uri":"Sunflower","surface_form":"sunflower","offset":43},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":75},{"uri":"Subspecies","surface_form":"subspecies","offset":113},{"uri":"Asexual","surface_form":"asexual","offset":417},{"uri":"Genetically","surface_form":"genetically","offset":446}]}
