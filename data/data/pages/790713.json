{"id":790713,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_%C5%A0kripcu","text":"U \u0160kripcu (; trans. \"In Dire Straits\") was a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade.\nThe band was created in 1980 by Zoran Vulovi\u0107 \"Vule\" (keyboards), Milan Del\u010Di\u0107 \"Del\u010Da\" (vocals) and Aleksandar Vasiljevi\u0107 \"Vasa\" (guitar), who later added Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 (drums) and Aleksandar Luki\u0107 (bass guitar) to the band, and to change the name of the band to U \u0160kripcu. After the band became successful and popular around Yugoslavia with the release of the album \"O je!\" and EP \"Nove godine!\", they failed to repeat this success, and so they disbanded in 1985.\nIn 1986, Vulovi\u0107 and Del\u010Di\u0107 re-created the band, but the latter soon left the band, so the new lineup, which included the vocalist Aleksandar Taba\u0161 and various musicians, recorded the fourth studio album, \"U \u0160kripcu\". The album was not successful, so the band disbanded again in 1988. The next year, Vulovi\u0107 reunited with Del\u010Di\u0107 and Vasiljevi\u0107, Luki\u0107 on guitar, bassist Dejan \u0160kopelja, and drummer Ratko Ljubi\u010Di\u0107. They recorded the fifth studio album \"Izgleda da mi smo sami\". After this, the band disbanded again. After this, Vulovi\u0107 became a producer and manager, Del\u010Di\u0107 pursued a solo career with his band Sklekovi, and Vasiljevi\u0107 and Luki\u0107 became a part of the supergroup Familija. In 2007, the original lineup came back together at the Del\u010Da i Sklekovi concert at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, which was released in 2008 as \"Ljubilarnih 20 i ne\u0161to godina - Live\", under the moniker Del\u010Da a i U \u0160kripcu.
