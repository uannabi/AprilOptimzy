{"id":790725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics)","text":"=\"preserve\">Plasticity, or plastic deformation, is the ability of a solid material to have a permanent change in shape. In physics and materials science, this is called deformation.\nFor example, a solid piece of metal being bent or pounded into a new shape shows plasticity. Permanent changes occur in the material itself. In engineering, the transition from elastic behaviour to plastic behaviour is known as yielding.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":123},{"uri":"Materials_science","surface_form":"materials science","offset":135},{"uri":"Deformation_(engineering)","surface_form":"deformation","offset":169},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":326},{"uri":"Elasticity_(physics)","surface_form":"elastic","offset":359},{"uri":"Yield_(engineering)","surface_form":"yielding","offset":410}]}
