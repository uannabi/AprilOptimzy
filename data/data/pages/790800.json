{"id":790800,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church","text":"On June 1, 2020, amid the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C., law enforcement officers used tear gas and other riot control tactics to forcefully clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square.\nThis was done to create a path for President Donald Trump and senior administration officials to walk from the White House to St. John's Episcopal Church. Trump held up a Bible and posed for a photo shoot in front of Ashburton House (the church's parish house), which had been damaged by a fire during protests the night before.\nFormer military leaders, current religious leaders, and elected officials from both parties criticized Trump for the event. The event was described by \"The New York Times\" as \"a burst of violence unlike any seen in the shadow of the White House in generations\" and possibly one of the defining moments of the Trump presidency.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"George_Floyd_protests","surface_form":"George Floyd protests","offset":26},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":51},{"uri":"Tear_gas","surface_form":"tear gas","offset":99},{"uri":"Riot_control","surface_form":"riot control","offset":118},{"uri":"Lafayette_Square%2C_Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Lafayette Square","offset":184},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":247},{"uri":"White_House","surface_form":"White House","offset":313},{"uri":"St._John%27s_Episcopal_Church%2C_Lafayette_Square","surface_form":"St. John's Episcopal Church","offset":328},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":373},{"uri":"Ashburton_House","surface_form":"Ashburton House","offset":419},{"uri":"Parish_house","surface_form":"parish house","offset":449},{"uri":"The_New_York_Times","surface_form":"The New York Times","offset":683}]}
