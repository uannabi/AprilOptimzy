They are one way plants can reproduce asexually. They connect with phloem and xylem to get nourishment.\nSome plants normally develop adventitious buds on their roots. The buds can grow quite a distance from the plant. Shoots that develop from adventitious buds on roots are termed suckers. They occur in many grasses, quaking aspen and Canada thistle. A famous quaking aspen known as the Pando grew from one trunk to 47,000 trunks by adventitious bud formation on a single root system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bud","surface_form":"bud","offset":25},{"uri":"Plants","surface_form":"plants","offset":110},{"uri":"Asexual_reproduction","surface_form":"reproduce asexually","offset":121},{"uri":"Phloem","surface_form":"phloem","offset":160},{"uri":"Xylem","surface_form":"xylem","offset":171},{"uri":"Roots","surface_form":"roots","offset":253},{"uri":"Grasses","surface_form":"grasses","offset":402},{"uri":"Quaking_aspen","surface_form":"quaking aspen","offset":411},{"uri":"Canada_thistle","surface_form":"Canada thistle","offset":429},{"uri":"Pando_(tree)","surface_form":"Pando","offset":481}]}
