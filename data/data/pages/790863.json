It decomposes into lithium and nitrogen when heated.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by metathesis reaction between sodium azide and lithium nitrate or lithium sulfate solutions. It can also be made by reacting lithium sulfate with barium azide.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lithium_salt","surface_form":"lithium salt","offset":21},{"uri":"Hydrazoic_acid","surface_form":"hydrazoic acid","offset":37},{"uri":"Chemical_stability","surface_form":"unstable","offset":62},{"uri":"Decomposition","surface_form":"decomposes","offset":94},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":110},{"uri":"Nitrogen","surface_form":"nitrogen","offset":122},{"uri":"Metathesis","surface_form":"metathesis","offset":175},{"uri":"Sodium_azide","surface_form":"sodium azide","offset":203},{"uri":"Lithium_nitrate","surface_form":"lithium nitrate","offset":220},{"uri":"Lithium_sulfate","surface_form":"lithium sulfate","offset":239},{"uri":"Barium_azide","surface_form":"barium azide","offset":319}]}
