{"id":790889,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_bis(trimethylsilyl)amide","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide is a lithiated organosilicon compound. Its chemical formula is LiN(SiMe3)2. It is commonly abbreviated as LiHMDS which means lithium hexamethyldisilazide. It is mainly used as a strong non-nucleophilic base and as a ligand.\nPreparation.\nIt can be made by the deprotonation of bis(trimethylsilyl)amine with n-butyllithium. Once its made, the compound can be purified by sublimation or distillation.\nUses.\nIt is often used in organic chemistry as a strong non-nucleophilic base. It can be used to make many organolithium compounds, including acetylides or lithium enolates.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lithiation","surface_form":"lithiated","offset":51},{"uri":"Organosilicon_compound","surface_form":"organosilicon compound","offset":61},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":89},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviated","offset":137},{"uri":"Non-nucleophilic_base","surface_form":"non-nucleophilic base","offset":231},{"uri":"Ligand","surface_form":"ligand","offset":262},{"uri":"Deprotonation","surface_form":"deprotonation","offset":305},{"uri":"Bis(trimethylsilyl)amine","surface_form":"bis(trimethylsilyl)amine","offset":322},{"uri":"N-butyllithium","surface_form":"n-butyllithium","offset":352},{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"compound","offset":387},{"uri":"Purification","surface_form":"purified","offset":403},{"uri":"Sublimation","surface_form":"sublimation","offset":415},{"uri":"Distillation","surface_form":"distillation","offset":430},{"uri":"Organic_chemistry","surface_form":"organic chemistry","offset":470},{"uri":"Non-nucleophilic_base","surface_form":"non-nucleophilic base","offset":500},{"uri":"Organolithium","surface_form":"organolithium","offset":551},{"uri":"Acetylide","surface_form":"acetylides","offset":586},{"uri":"Enol","surface_form":"enolates","offset":608}]}
