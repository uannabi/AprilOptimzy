In 2010, 1,292 people lived on the island, most of which live in the two main villages of Savoonga and Gambell.\nHistory.\nThe island is thought to have been home to several old natives, mostly by the Siberian Yupik around 2,500 years ago.\nIn 1878, a famine hit the island, causing over 1,000 people to die, and many others to leave.\nDuring the Cold War, a P2V Neptune by the US Navy were shot down by the Soviet with two fighter planes, forcing it to fly down to Gambell Airport, where the plane crashed. None of the 11 onboard were killed, but 7 were injured.\nTransportation.\nThe island has two main airports, one at Gambell and another at Savoonga.
