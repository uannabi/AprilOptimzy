{"id":790953,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluey_(dog)","text":"Bluey (7 June 1910 \u2013 14 November 1939) was an Australian Cattle Dog. Bluey's owners are Les and Esma Hall from Rochester, Victoria, Australia. \"Guinness World Records\" says that Bluey is the oldest known dog. Bluey lived for 29 years and 5 months.\nAnother dog named Chilla was said to have lived for 32 years. A study was done to see if Australian Cattle Dogs lived longer than other dog breeds. 100 dogs were surveyed. The study showed that Australian Cattle Dogs lived on average for 13.41 years, almost a year longer than other dog breeds. In the end, the study says that Bluey and Chilla should be seen as distinct from other dogs instead of showing longer lives for Australian Cattle Dogs.\nThree other dogs named Max, Bella, and Maggie were said by their owners to have lived longer than Bluey. \"Guinness World Records\" did not put any of the dogs in their book because the dog owners could not verify that fact.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australian_Cattle_Dog","surface_form":"Australian Cattle Dog","offset":46},{"uri":"Rochester%2C_Victoria","surface_form":"Rochester","offset":111},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australia)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":122},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":132},{"uri":"Guinness_World_Records","surface_form":"Guinness World Records","offset":144},{"uri":"Study","surface_form":"study","offset":312},{"uri":"Dog_breed","surface_form":"dog breed","offset":384},{"uri":"Statistical_survey","surface_form":"surveyed","offset":410},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":474},{"uri":"Distinct","surface_form":"distinct","offset":610},{"uri":"Max_(dog)","surface_form":"Max","offset":718},{"uri":"Verify","surface_form":"verify","offset":900}]}
