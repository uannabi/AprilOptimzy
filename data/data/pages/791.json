{"id":791,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed","text":"Speed is the distance of a moving object in a given amount of time. Speed is a measure of how fast something is moving. The average speed of an object in a certain time is the distance the object travelled divided by the time. Speed is also the distance covered by an object per unit time.\nFinding speed.\nTo find speed formula_1,\nformula_1formula_1\nwhere formula_1 is the distance and formula_1 is the time that has gone by.\nUnits of measurement for speed.\nThere are many units of measurement for speed. For example, an object's speed can be measured in\nChanging speed.\nWhen an object changes speed, it gets faster or slower. If the speed of the object increases, it is called acceleration. If the object gets slower, and the speed decreases, it is called deceleration, or negative acceleration.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":13},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":34},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":62},{"uri":"Measure","surface_form":"measure","offset":79},{"uri":"Division_(mathematics)","surface_form":"divided","offset":206},{"uri":"Units_of_measurement","surface_form":"units of measurement","offset":472},{"uri":"Slow","surface_form":"slow","offset":618},{"uri":"Acceleration","surface_form":"acceleration","offset":677},{"uri":"Decrease","surface_form":"decreases","offset":732},{"uri":"Deceleration","surface_form":"deceleration","offset":756},{"uri":"Negative","surface_form":"negative","offset":773}]}
