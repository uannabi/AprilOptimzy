{"id":791172,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_fringed_frog","text":"The leaf green tree frog, leaf green river tree frog or narrow fringed tree frog (\"Ranoidea nudidigita\") is a frog from Victoria and New South Wales. It lives on the flat lands not far from the ocean.\nThis frog is 2.5 to 4.0 cm long. It is bright green, dark green or brown. Adult frogs can change color. It has a black and gold stripe down its side. It lives in streams and lays eggs in small pools next to the stream. Tadpoles swim in the stream and eat algae from rocks. Scientists used to think it was the same species as \"Litoria phyllochroa\", which is also called leaf green tree frog, but they now think it is its own species. They think so because the \"Ranoidea nudidigita\" has a different voice call and lives in different places than \"Litoria phyllochroa\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":110},{"uri":"Victoria_(Australian_state)","surface_form":"Victoria","offset":120},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":133},{"uri":"Litoria_phyllochroa","surface_form":"Litoria phyllochroa","offset":527}]}
