Streptokinase is used mainly treat heart attacks (Myocardia Infarction). There are 2 main types of heart attacks; STEMI and non-STEMI and Streptokinase is only used in STEMI type heart attacks after confirming with an ECG. It is given as an injection into a vein.\nSide Effects.\nCommon side effects of Streptokinase are;\nIt is not recommended to use streptokinase during the lifetime of a person more than once due to the risk of developing allergic reactions.\nDiscovery.\nStreptokinase was discovered in 1933 by American microbiologist, William S. Tillett, from a bacteria known as beta-hemolytic streptococci.
