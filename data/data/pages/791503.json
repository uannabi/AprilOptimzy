The temperature of Tau Bo\u00F6tis b is 1600 K.\nDiscovery.\nIt was discovered in 1996. It was one of the first extrasolar planets that was discovered. It was discovered orbiting the star Tau Bo\u00F6tis b by Paul Butler and his team. They used the radial velocity method to find the planet.\nOrbit and mass.\nTau Bo\u00F6tis b has a mass that is over four times the mass of Jupiter. One orbital revolution takes 3 days 7.5 hours.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Extrasolar_planet","surface_form":"extrasolar planet","offset":19},{"uri":"Light_year","surface_form":"light years","offset":61},{"uri":"Radial_velocity","surface_form":"radial velocity","offset":316},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":351},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":435},{"uri":"Orbital_revolution","surface_form":"orbital revolution","offset":448}]}
