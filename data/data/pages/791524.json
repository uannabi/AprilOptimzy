{"id":791524,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_water-holding_frog","text":"The western water-holding frog is a frog from Australia. Scientists are not sure whether it should be called \"Ranoidea occidentalis\" or \"Cyclorana occidentalis\". It lives in Western Australia.\nThe adult male frog is 6.0 cm long and the adult female frog is 7.0 cm long. It has a flat body. The frog lives in places where the ground is dry. It has webbed feet and spends much of its time in the water. Because it has such a wide head, scientist think this frog eats other frogs. They think it eats them when they come to lay eggs in the same temporary bodies of water where the western water-holding frog lays its eggs.\nThis frog has young when it rains. The female lays eggs in bodies of water that dry up quickly, 500 at a time.\nThe tadpoles are 8.0 cm long. Once they become young frogs, they are 3.5 cm long.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":36},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":46},{"uri":"Ranoidea_(genus)","surface_form":"Ranoidea","offset":110},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":174}]}
