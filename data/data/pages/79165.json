{"id":79165,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warthog","text":"Warthog (\"Phacochoerus africanus\") are remarkable animals. They are found in most of Africa south of the Sahara and are widely distributed in East Africa. They are the only pigs able to live in areas without water for several months of the year. By tolerating a higher-than-normal body temperature, the warthog is perhaps able to conserve moisture inside its body that might otherwise be used for cooling. (Camels and desert gazelles have developed a similar mechanism for survival in hot, arid environments.)\nHabitat.\nWarthogs are found in moist and arid savannas. They avoid rainforest, deserts and high mountains.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":85},{"uri":"Sahara","surface_form":"Sahara","offset":105},{"uri":"Pig","surface_form":"pig","offset":173},{"uri":"Camel","surface_form":"Camel","offset":407},{"uri":"Gazelle","surface_form":"gazelle","offset":425},{"uri":"Savannah","surface_form":"savannas","offset":556},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":589},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":606}]}
