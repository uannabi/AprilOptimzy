They are also called primordial isotopes.\nPrimordial nuclides are found in the interstellar medium. They were formed in or after the Big Bang, by nucleosynthesis in stars and supernovae. or by being hit by cosmic rays. Only 286 primordial nuclides are known.\nThere are 252 \"stable\" nuclides, plus another 34 nuclides that have half-lives long enough to have survived from the formation of the Earth. These are the primordial nuclides. The 34 primordial radionuclides are isotopes of 28 separate elements.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nuclide","surface_form":"nuclides","offset":24},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":42},{"uri":"Interstellar_medium","surface_form":"interstellar medium","offset":181},{"uri":"Big_Bang","surface_form":"Big Bang","offset":235},{"uri":"Nucleosynthesis","surface_form":"nucleosynthesis","offset":248},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"stars","offset":267},{"uri":"Supernovae","surface_form":"supernovae","offset":277},{"uri":"Cosmic_rays","surface_form":"cosmic rays","offset":308}]}
