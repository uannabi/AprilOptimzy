It was introduced after the Norman Invasion. Urian Brereton was the first person to acquire this title. Paul G. Guppy holds the legal rights of the title as per the contract drawn up between him and the Manorial Counsel Limited on October 13, 2016, in compliance with the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 (Hatton Solicitors).\nHistory.\nBefore the Battle of Hastings, Norman Invasion in 1066, Caldecote was Edeva the Fair. After the Norman Invasion, in 1085, William the Conqueror ordered the commission of the Domesday Book. It was published in 1086 and divided the English counties into 13,418 manors under the governance of Lord of Manor. During this time, Caldecote was under the ownership of Bishop of Chester. The Caldecote Manor was transferred to Herbert Ruffus of Walsall in 1166 and was then passed to William Rufus. It then descended through Margaret, William\u2019s daughter.\nKing Henry I granted the Lordship of Houghton Regis and Domesday manors to Dunstable Priory, the Priory Church of St Peter. King John supported the decision, and it resulted in an attack on gallows of the Priory at Eddesuthe by Eudo la Zouche, Lord of Cantelou. The Lords also broke open the Priory\u2019s jail at Caldecote.\nDescription.\nManorial Lordship is not a title of nobility as per the modern British honours system and is related to property ownership. It is an ownership title that can be transferred, conveyed, and even sold. This title is inheritable by the Lord or Lady\u2019s child after their demise. The title is also referred to as the incorporeal hereditament as per the law.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Newport_Pagnell","surface_form":"Newport, Pagnell","offset":141},{"uri":"Norman_conquest_of_England","surface_form":"Norman Invasion","offset":204},{"uri":"Battle_of_Hastings","surface_form":"Battle of Hastings","offset":529},{"uri":"William_the_Conqueror","surface_form":"William the Conqueror","offset":640},{"uri":"Domesday_Book","surface_form":"Domesday Book","offset":692},{"uri":"Houghton_Regis","surface_form":"Houghton Regis","offset":1101},{"uri":"John_of_England","surface_form":"King John","offset":1188},{"uri":"Nobility","surface_form":"nobility","offset":1433}]}
