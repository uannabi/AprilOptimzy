{"id":792522,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_in_rounders","text":"=\"preserve\">\u2022There are different types of bowling in rounders including the fast, slow, spin and donkey drop bowls. A fast bowl can make the batter hit the ball up wards so it makes it easier for the defending team to catch the ball.\nThe ball is above the batters head or below the batters knee. The ball bounces on the way to the batter. The ball is thrown wide or straight at the batters body. The Bowler's foot is outside the square during the bowling action.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
