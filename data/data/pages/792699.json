{"id":792699,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis","text":"Rhabdomyolysis is where damaged skeletal muscles quickly break down.. The symptoms can be muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There can also be confusion and tea-colored urine. Rhabdomyolysis can also injure the kidneys with myoglobin.\nThe most common causes of Rhabdomyolysis are crush injury, strenuous exercise, medications, or drug abuse.\nDuring rhabdomyolysis, a protein that stores oxygen in the muscles called myoglobin is released into the blood. The kidneys filter the blood and remove the myoglobin. However, the myoglobin breaks down into other chemicals which damages the kidneys which can cause severe injury or even death.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skeletal_muscle","surface_form":"skeletal muscles","offset":32},{"uri":"Myalgia","surface_form":"muscle pains","offset":90},{"uri":"Vomiting","surface_form":"vomiting","offset":114},{"uri":"Mental_confusion","surface_form":"confusion","offset":128},{"uri":"Mental_confusion","surface_form":"confusion","offset":157},{"uri":"Kidney","surface_form":"kidney","offset":225},{"uri":"Myoglobin","surface_form":"myoglobin","offset":238},{"uri":"Crush_syndrome","surface_form":"crush injury","offset":294},{"uri":"Pharmaceutical_drug","surface_form":"medications","offset":328},{"uri":"Substance_abuse","surface_form":"drug abuse","offset":344},{"uri":"Myoglobin","surface_form":"myoglobin","offset":430}]}
