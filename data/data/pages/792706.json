{"id":792706,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(cricket)","text":"Stadium.\nA cricket ground is the area where cricket is played and the nearby areas. The Sydney Cricket Ground and Melbourne Cricket Ground are examples.\nBatsman's ground.\nThe two batsmens' grounds are the safe zones which batters run between to score points, with the risk of being out when they are not in them. One ground is at the striker's end, while the other ground is at the bowler's end, with a wicket being in each ground.\nA run out or stumping can only happen if the wicket that was put down (hit with the ball) is in a ground which no batsman is in.\nTo score a run, there must be one batsman in each ground, and they must swap grounds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sydney_Cricket_Ground","surface_form":"Sydney Cricket Ground","offset":88},{"uri":"Melbourne_Cricket_Ground","surface_form":"Melbourne Cricket Ground","offset":114},{"uri":"Out_(cricket)","surface_form":"out","offset":282},{"uri":"Striker%27s_end","surface_form":"striker's end","offset":334},{"uri":"Bowler%27s_end","surface_form":"bowler's end","offset":382},{"uri":"Wicket","surface_form":"wicket","offset":403},{"uri":"Run_out","surface_form":"run out","offset":434},{"uri":"Stumping","surface_form":"stumping","offset":445},{"uri":"Run_(cricket)","surface_form":"run","offset":572}]}
