It is named after the Jura mountains.\nThe largest city in the department is Dole but its prefecture (capital) is the city of Lons-le-Saunier.\nHistory.\nHistorically, Jura belonged to the Free County of Burgundy, known in French as the Franche-Comt\u00E9. Dole was the capital until the region was conquered by Louis XIV. Louis XIV moved the capital to Besan\u00E7on and Dole is now a \"sous-pr\u00E9fecture\" of Jura.\nAs early as the 13th century, inhabitants of the southern 2/3 of Jura spoke a dialect of Arpitan language. It continued to be spoken in rural areas into the 20th century.\nJura is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790. It was created from part of the former province of Free County. The department was created with six districts: Dole, Lons-le-Saunier, Orgelet, Poligny, Saint-Claude and Salins; the capital was Lons-le-Saunier alternating with Dole, Poligny and Salins but from 1794 only Lons-le-Saunier remained as the capital.\nIn 1800, with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in France, the six districts were changed into four \"arrondissements\": Lons-le-Saunier, Dole, Poligny and Saint-Claude. On 10 September 1926, the \"arrondissement\" of Poligny was eliminated.\nGeography.\nJura is part of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00E9 region.

The Swiss canton of Vaud is to the southeast.\nThe highest point in the department is Cr\u00EAt Pela (), high; it is also the highest mountain of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00E9 region. The \"Cr\u00EAt Pela\" mountain is in the \"For\u00EAt du Massacre\", Jura mountain range.\nMany lakes can be found throughout the Jura department. The largest natural lake in the department is the Lac De Chalain. It is long and wide. Lac de Vouglans was formed after the building of a hydro-electric dam; it is one of the largest man-made lakes in France.\nThe Ain river starts in the Jura department but it is the main river of the Ain department. The Doubs also flows through a part of the department. Many tributaries of both rivers flow, partially or completely, in the Jura department.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Jura varies greatly by elevation. The lower valleys are temperate and pleasant, but the high mountain valleys have bitterly cold winters.\nAdministration.\nJura is managed by the \"Departmental Council of Jura\" in Lons-le-Saunier. The department is part of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00E9 region.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThere are 3 \"arrondissements\" (districts), 17 \"cantons\" and 509 \"communes\" (municipalities) in Jura.\nDemographics.\nJura had a population, in 2014, of 260,681, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.
