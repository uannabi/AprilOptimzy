{"id":793213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Green_Deal","text":"e=\"preserve\">The European Green Deal is a set of policy plans by the European Commission with the aim of making Europe climate neutral in 2050. It will increase the EU's greenhouse gas emission reductions target for 2030 to at least 50% and towards 55% compared with 1990 levels.\nThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the European Green Deal would be Europe's \"man on the Moon moment\", as the plan would make Europe the first climate-neutral continent. Von der Leyen appointed Frans Timmermans as Executive Vice President of the European Commission for the European Green Deal.\nOn 13 December 2019, the European Council decided to approve the plan, with a rejection from Poland. On 15 January 2020 the European Parliament voted to support the deal as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"European_Commission","surface_form":"European Commission","offset":69},{"uri":"Greenhouse_gas","surface_form":"greenhouse gas","offset":170},{"uri":"Emission","surface_form":"emission","offset":185},{"uri":"Ursula_von_der_Leyen","surface_form":"Ursula von der Leyen","offset":322},{"uri":"Frans_Timmermans","surface_form":"Frans Timmermans","offset":513},{"uri":"European_Council","surface_form":"European Council","offset":639},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":707},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":738}]}
