The term may also be used for other granular materials.\nIn some schemes \"gravel\" is anything larger than sand (>2.0 mm), and includes \"granule\", \"pebble\", \"cobble\", and \"boulder\" in the above table. In this scheme, \"pebble\" covers the size range 4 to 64 mm (\u22122 to \u22126 \u03C6).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":62},{"uri":"Sediment","surface_form":"sediment","offset":95},{"uri":"Lithification","surface_form":"lithified","offset":112},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":122},{"uri":"Clastic_rock","surface_form":"clastic rock","offset":135},{"uri":"Granular_material","surface_form":"granular material","offset":186}]}
