{"id":79359,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Camille","text":"Hurricane Camille was the third named storm and second hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season. Camille was the second of three Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States during the 20th century, which it did near the mouth of the Mississippi River on the night of August 17, resulting in catastrophic damage.\nThe storm formed on August 14 and rapidly deepened. It scraped the western edge of Cuba at Category 3 strength. Camille strengthened further over the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall with a pressure of 900\u00A0mbar (hPa), estimated sustained winds of 200;mph (305\u00A0h), and a peak storm surge of 24 feet (7.3 m); by maximum sustained wind speeds, Camille was the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone recorded worldwide, and one of only four tropical cyclones worldwide ever to achieve wind speeds of 190\u00A0mph. The hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of the U.S. state of Mississippi, and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. In total, Camille killed 259 people and caused $1.42 billion (1969 USD, $9.14 billion 2005 USD) in damages.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"named storm","offset":32},{"uri":"1969_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"1969 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":72},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Category 5","offset":136},{"uri":"Landfall_(meteorology)","surface_form":"landfall","offset":166},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":182},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"20th century","offset":207},{"uri":"Mississippi_River","surface_form":"Mississippi River","offset":256},{"uri":"August_17","surface_form":"August 17","offset":290},{"uri":"August_14","surface_form":"August 14","offset":355},{"uri":"Rapid_deepening","surface_form":"rapidly deepened","offset":369},{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":418},{"uri":"Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale","surface_form":"Category 3","offset":426},{"uri":"Mbar","surface_form":"mbar","offset":541},{"uri":"HPa","surface_form":"hPa","offset":547},{"uri":"Mph","surface_form":"mph","offset":586},{"uri":"H","surface_form":"h","offset":595},{"uri":"Storm_surge","surface_form":"storm surge","offset":610},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"feet","offset":628},{"uri":"M","surface_form":"m","offset":638},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":905},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":919},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":954},{"uri":"Appalachian_Mountains","surface_form":"Appalachian Mountains","offset":1000},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":1025},{"uri":"USD","surface_form":"USD","offset":1102}]}
