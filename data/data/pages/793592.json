{"id":793592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cow_(cartoon)","text":"Blue Cow is an animated blue cow made by Blue-Zoo. She was seen in the BBC children's television series The Story Makers. The television series was mostly shown on CBeebies, but was previously shown on BBC Two.\nBlue Cow wonders what happens outside the field she lives in. In all episodes, she wonders about something different. The other cows in the field, who are black and white, do not believe her, so they say \"she's off again.\" Blue Cow then rides in a red double decker bus, which takes her to a place where she finds out the answer to what she is wondering about.\nWhen Blue Cow goes back to her field at the end of the episode, she tells the other cows in the field what she did during the day. The other cows still do not believe her, so they say \"Everyone knows cows can't...\", then a description of what she did. After that, the narrator usually says \"But we know they can, don't we?\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cattle","surface_form":"cow","offset":29},{"uri":"Blue-Zoo_Productions","surface_form":"Blue-Zoo","offset":41},{"uri":"BBC","surface_form":"BBC","offset":71},{"uri":"The_Story_Makers","surface_form":"The Story Makers","offset":104},{"uri":"CBeebies","surface_form":"CBeebies","offset":164},{"uri":"BBC_Two","surface_form":"BBC Two","offset":202},{"uri":"Double-decker_bus","surface_form":"double decker bus","offset":463}]}
