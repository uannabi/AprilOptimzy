Someone in a Cadillac car drove up to his car and shot him. He died in a hospital on September 13. The public never found out who shot him.\nShakur's friend from Death Row Records, Marion \"Suge\" Knight, was in the car with Shakur, but he lived.\nIn 2002, reporter Chuck Phillips wrote in the \"Los Angeles Times\" that another rapper called Biggie Smalls could have paid members of the Crips street gang to kill Shakur and that he could have given them the gun.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tupac_Shakur","surface_form":"Tupac Shakur","offset":28},{"uri":"Drive-by_shooting","surface_form":"drive-by shooting","offset":58},{"uri":"Las_Vegas","surface_form":"Las Vegas","offset":79},{"uri":"Cadillac","surface_form":"Cadillac","offset":124},{"uri":"Biggie_Smalls","surface_form":"Biggie Smalls","offset":448},{"uri":"Crips","surface_form":"Crips","offset":493}]}
