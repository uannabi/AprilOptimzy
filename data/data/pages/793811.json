{"id":793811,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MsChif","text":"Rachel Frobel (n\u00E9e Collins, b. 1976) is an American professional wrestler who is better known by her ring name MsChif. She has been wrestling since 2001 and in that time has worked for several independent promotions across the United States, with guest matches in England and Japan. She is known for her banshee gimmick, howling at her opponents and referees who stand in her way, as well as her unusually flexible body that allows her to perform, and be subjected to, modified submission holds.\nFor two years, between 2008 and 2010, she was a triple crown champion holding the NWA World Women's Championship for the second time, as well as the Shimmer Championship and the NWA Midwest Women's Championship. As well as being a two-time NWA World Champion, she is also a ChickFight tournament winner.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Name_at_birth","surface_form":"n\u00E9e","offset":15},{"uri":"Professional_wrestler","surface_form":"professional wrestler","offset":52},{"uri":"Ring_name","surface_form":"ring name","offset":101},{"uri":"Independent_circuit","surface_form":"independent promotions","offset":193},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":227},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":264},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":276},{"uri":"Banshee","surface_form":"banshee","offset":304},{"uri":"NWA_World_Women%27s_Championship","surface_form":"NWA World Women's Championship","offset":578},{"uri":"Shimmer_Championship","surface_form":"Shimmer Championship","offset":645},{"uri":"ChickFight","surface_form":"ChickFight","offset":770}]}
