{"id":79390,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naiad_(moon)","text":"Naiad or Neptune\u00A0III is the closest moon to Neptune named after the Naiads of Greek legend. It was found sometime before mid-September, 1989 from the images taken by the \"Voyager 2\" probe. The last moon to be discovered during the flyby, it was designated S/1989\u00A0N\u00A06. Naiad is not a sphere and probably has not been changed by any internal geological processes after its formation. It orbits about 23,500\u00A0km above Neptune's cloud tops.\nSince the \"Voyager 2\" flyby, the Neptune system has been studied a lot from ground-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope as well. In 2002-03, Keck telescope looked at the system using adaptive optics and detected easily the biggest four closer satellites. Thalassa was found with some image processing, but Naiad was not located.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neptune_(planet)","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":44},{"uri":"Naiads","surface_form":"Naiads","offset":68},{"uri":"Greek_Mythology","surface_form":"Greek legend","offset":78},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":171},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"probe","offset":182},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":283},{"uri":"Observatory","surface_form":"observatories","offset":525},{"uri":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"Hubble Space Telescope","offset":547},{"uri":"Keck_telescopes","surface_form":"Keck telescope","offset":591},{"uri":"Adaptive_optics","surface_form":"adaptive optics","offset":633}]}
