{"id":79417,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassa_(moon)","text":"Thalassa or Neptune\u00A0IV, is the second closest moon to Neptune. It was named after a daughter of Aether and Hemera from Greek mythology.\n\"Thalassa\" is also the Greek word for \"sea\".\nThalassa was discovered sometime before mid-September, 1989 from the images taken by the \"Voyager 2\" probe. It was given the designation S/1989\u00A0N\u00A05. The discovery was said (IAUC 4867) on September 29, 1989, but the text only talks of \"25 frames taken over 11 days\", giving a discovery date of sometime before September 18. The name was given on 16 September 1991.\nThalassa is not a sphere and shows no sign of any geological changes. Unusually for a non-spherical moon, it appears to be oddly shaped not able to be explained.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neptune_(planet)","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":54},{"uri":"Aether","surface_form":"Aether","offset":96},{"uri":"Hemera","surface_form":"Hemera","offset":107},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":119},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":159},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":175},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":271},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"probe","offset":282},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":563}]}
