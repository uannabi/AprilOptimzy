{"id":794595,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Greater_Manchester","text":"The Flag of Greater Manchester is the flag of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester in England.\nHistory.\nThe flag was adopted by Greater Manchester County Council in 1974, and derives from the shield and crest design on the coat of arms of Greater Manchester; the design itself is used by a number of organisations that represent the Greater Manchester area, such as the former Greater Manchester County Council, the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, and the Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force, all of which use ten golden towers on a red background to represent the ten metropolitan boroughs.\nDescription.\nThe flag is composed of ten golden castles (arranged in rows of 3\u20132\u20133\u20132) on a red background, fringed by a golden border in the style of a castle battlement. The blazon is: \"Gules, ten Towers three two three two, all within a Bordure embattled Or\".\nThe ten golden castles represent both the urban landscape of Greater Manchester, and its division in to its ten metropolitan districts: Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Tameside, Trafford, Salford, Stockport, and Wigan. The red ground represents manpower and the region's red-brick architectural heritage, both legacies of Greater Manchester's industrial past. The embattled border represents the unity and shared future of the region, and its bold, vigilant and forward-looking character.\nUsage.\nThe flag currently flies in front of the National Rail offices at Manchester Piccadilly railway station, and in front of Rochdale Town Hall.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metropolitan_county","surface_form":"metropolitan county","offset":50},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Greater Manchester","offset":73},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":95},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester_County_Council","surface_form":"Greater Manchester County Council","offset":137},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms_of_Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"coat of arms of Greater Manchester","offset":232},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester_Fire_and_Rescue_Service","surface_form":"Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service","offset":425},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester_Army_Cadet_Force","surface_form":"Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force","offset":477},{"uri":"Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Greater Manchester","offset":936},{"uri":"Bolton","surface_form":"Bolton","offset":1011},{"uri":"Bury%2C_Greater_Manchester","surface_form":"Bury","offset":1019},{"uri":"Manchester","surface_form":"Manchester","offset":1025},{"uri":"Oldham","surface_form":"Oldham","offset":1037},{"uri":"Rochdale","surface_form":"Rochdale","offset":1045},{"uri":"Tameside","surface_form":"Tameside","offset":1055},{"uri":"Trafford","surface_form":"Trafford","offset":1065},{"uri":"City_of_Salford","surface_form":"Salford","offset":1075},{"uri":"Stockport","surface_form":"Stockport","offset":1084},{"uri":"Wigan","surface_form":"Wigan","offset":1099},{"uri":"National_Rail","surface_form":"National Rail","offset":1424},{"uri":"Manchester_Piccadilly_station","surface_form":"Manchester Piccadilly railway station","offset":1449},{"uri":"Rochdale_Town_Hall","surface_form":"Rochdale Town Hall","offset":1504}]}
