{"id":794614,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Junagadh_State","text":"The flag of former Junagadh State is based on the Civil State Ensign of the Flag of Pakistan in the canton. According to traditional official description, The badge is a white disk with Green objects are described in the warrant as 'bezants' and 'mountains' in the centre of the disk, with the name of the state at the top, with the state badge located in the fly respectively.\nHistory.\nJunagadh and Bantva-Manavadar was a Princely \"Maritime State\" which faced towards the Arabian Sea with Pakistan, in the Kathiawar Peninsula, the capital city was Junagarh. Ruled by Muslim rulers in British Raj till its illegal annexation into the Indian nation in 1948. It had an area of 8,904.6 Sq. Km\u00B2 (3,438 Sq. Mi\u00B2) and was bigger than Puerto Rico but was smaller than the Cyprus.\nMohammad Sher khan Babi, who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh and declaring independence in 1730 after Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher khan Babi, was the founder of the \"Babi Dynasty\" of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, conquered large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries, first as tributaries of Marathas, and later under the Suzerainty of the British Raj. The Junagadh family shares joint descent with the princely houses of Radhanpur and Balasinor, and the small states of Bantva, Manavadar and Sardargarh. Descendents of the Ghilzai Pathans from Afghanistan, they entered India under Usman Khan Babi, a follower of Emperor Humayun. His son, Sher Khan Babi, arrived in Gujarat in the train of Prince Murad Baksh, the Imperial Viceroy. For many years, the family remained the faithful, though powerful, local fief holders of and exceptional loyalty to the Mughal power. The impending collapse of the Islamic Indian empire during the early years of the eighteenth century, prompted the family household to carve out independent Kingdoms of their own to govern, from various landholdings and governorships they held sway. Sher Khan Babi, the Chief of the family, founded the state by expelling the then Mogul Governor in 1735. Originally a Rajput domain, it fell to the Muslims commanded by Mohammed Bagra of Ahmedabad in 1472.\nSher Khan's descendent held the posts and ruled over the state for the next two centuries, for a period as tributaries of Baroda, and later it came under the Suzerainty of the British Raj. In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate and The East India Company took control of the state by 1818 and the Saurashtra area with other Princely states of Kathiawar peninsula were separately administrated under Kathiawar Agency by British India.\nIn 1947 upon the Independence of Pakistan and the Indian Transfer of Power, the last Babi dynasty ruler of the state Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III merged it into newly formed Dominion of Pakistan. Although surrounded on three sides by the Dominion of India, and on the fourth by open Arabian Sea. On 15th August it acceded to Pakistan and Pakistan Government accepted on 13th September 1947, following the Independence of the new Dominions of the Republic of India and Pakistan, the Khan Sahib Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji acceded his state of Manavadar to Pakistan, even though, being a Vassal state of Junagadh State, the prince had every right to do so. This act was done at the same time as his master, the Nawab of Junagadh who himself had the right not to accede his state to modern India, this was fully in accordance with the agreed principles for accession of Princely states. The accession not agreeable to the Indians, they applied various methods of tactic intimidation. They induced two vassal rulers to accede to their country in return for recognition as independent rulers, but even this did not last very long. Simultaneously, 'People's Committees' and the Indian National Congress party agitators were most encouraged to ferment civil unrest and create disturbances, against the new Dominion of Pakistan aimed at reducing the administration to chaos. The Nawab and his remaining family had fled to the safety fearing for their lives on the 24th October in 1947, and chose to flee to their desired country, followed shortly afterwards by his Prime Minister they all eventually settled in the port city of Karachi (then as the capital of the nation).\nIn response to this Indian armed occupying forces acted very quickly and illegally entered the abandoned state by invading it inhabitants and assumed full control on the poor defenceless people, then arranged a Referendum by the GOI under their own organised auspices and even appointed its own administrator on the 9th November. The largely Hindu population were influenced and inevitably expressed an overwhelming wish to join the India. A mere 91 voters out of 201, 457 souls taking part wanted to remain and voted in favour of Pakistan. A surprising result, given that the state had a 40% Muslim population, which was considered a Dependency to the allied country by safeguarding their rights as a minority now as the claimed Disputed territory of Pakistan. Nawab Mahabat Khan III is much maligned by modern Indian \"historians\" and popular writers, largely because of his concern for wildlife and domesticated animals, their welfare and conservation. Much is written about a marriage party that he arranged for a favourite pet dog, but the fact of matter is that Saurashtra was blessed with its only tracts of forests land because of him, was never mentioned. He took major steps and dedication to protect the dwindling Gir forests, final abode of the remaining population of the Asiatic Lions. His interests in animal husbandry improved the breeding stock of Kathiwadi horses and Gir cattle, greatly improving the milk yields of the latter. His reign saw the opening of the massive Willingdon Dam, built the Bahadur Khanji Library and opened the Mahabat Khan free college. Upon his death in 1959 the Government of Pakistan installed and recognised the Junagadh House in Karachi, 9th October 1991. The Nawab of Junagadh Foundation Trust is also located there.\uFEFF","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Junagadh_State","surface_form":"Junagadh State","offset":19},{"uri":"Flag_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Flag of Pakistan","offset":76},{"uri":"Canton_(flag)","surface_form":"canton","offset":100},{"uri":"Maritime_republics","surface_form":"Maritime State","offset":433},{"uri":"Arabian_Sea","surface_form":"Arabian Sea","offset":473},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":490},{"uri":"Kathiawar_Peninsula","surface_form":"Kathiawar Peninsula","offset":507},{"uri":"Suzerainty","surface_form":"Suzerainty","offset":1250},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British Raj","offset":1268},{"uri":"Gujarat","surface_form":"Gujarat","offset":1595},{"uri":"Kathiawar_Agency","surface_form":"Kathiawar Agency","offset":2668},{"uri":"Independence_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Independence of Pakistan","offset":2720},{"uri":"Indian_Independence_Act%2C_1947","surface_form":"Indian Transfer of Power","offset":2753},{"uri":"Dominion_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Dominion of Pakistan","offset":2876},{"uri":"Pakistan_Government","surface_form":"Pakistan Government","offset":3040},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"Referendum","offset":4574},{"uri":"Disputed_territory","surface_form":"Disputed territory","offset":5093},{"uri":"Asiatic_Lion","surface_form":"Asiatic Lion","offset":5647},{"uri":"Junagadh_House","surface_form":"Junagadh House","offset":6020},{"uri":"Nawab_of_Junagadh_Foundation_Trust","surface_form":"Nawab of Junagadh Foundation Trust","offset":6069}]}
