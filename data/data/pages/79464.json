{"id":79464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race","text":"A relay race is a track and field event in which athletes run a pre-set distance carrying a baton before passing it onto the next runner. Often, a relay team is a team of four sprinters.\nIn athletics, the two standard relays are the 4x100 meter relay and the 4x400 meter relay. Traditionally, the 4x400 meter relay finals are the last event of a track meet.\nNowadays, long distance relays have become increasingly popular with runners of all skill-levels. These runners typically have 5 to 36 legs, each between 5 and 10 kilometers (3-6 miles) long.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Athletics_(track_and_field)","surface_form":"track and field","offset":18},{"uri":"Baton","surface_form":"baton","offset":92},{"uri":"Sprint","surface_form":"sprinters","offset":176},{"uri":"Track_and_field_athletics","surface_form":"athletics","offset":190},{"uri":"Meter","surface_form":"meter","offset":239},{"uri":"Kilometer","surface_form":"kilometer","offset":521},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":537}]}
