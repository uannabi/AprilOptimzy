{"id":7947,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower","text":"A flower is the reproductive part of flowering plants. A flower is a special part of the plant. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.\nIn all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.\nFlowers may grow separately on the plant, or they may grow together in an inflorescence.\nStructure of flowers.\nTo investigate the structure of a flower, it must be dissected, and its structure summarised by a floral diagram or a floral formula. Then its family can be identified with the aid of a flora, which is a book designed to help you identify plants.\nFour basic parts.\nAlthough this arrangement is typical, plant species show a wide variation in floral structure. The modifications produced in the evolution of flowering plants are used by botanists to find relationships among plant species.\nFlowers are an important evolutionary advance made by flowering plants. Some flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Their pollen grains are light-weight. Many others rely on insects or birds to move pollen. Theirs are heavier. The role of flowers is to produce seeds, which are contained in fruit. Fruits and seeds are a means of dispersal. Plants do not move, but wind, animals and birds spread the plants across the landscape.\nSince the ovules are protected by carpels, it takes something special for fertilisation to happen. Angiosperms have pollen grains comprising just three cells. One cell is responsible for drilling down through the integuments, and creating a passage for the two sperm cells to flow down. The megagametophyte is a tiny haploid female plant which includes the egg. It has just seven cells. Of these, one is the egg cell; it fuses with a sperm cell, forming the zygote. Another cell joins with the other sperm, and dedicates itself to forming a nutrient-rich endosperm. The other cells take auxiliary roles. This process of \"double fertilisation\" is unique and common to all angiosperms.\nEvolution of flowers.\nFlowers are modified leaves possessed only by the flowering plants (angiosperms), which are relatively late to appear in the fossil record.\nThe earliest known fossils of flowers and flowering plants are from 130 million years ago, in the Lower Cretaceous.\nThe flowering plants have long been assumed to have evolved from within the gymnosperms; but the known gymnosperms form a clade which is distinct from the angiosperms. It has been concluded that the two clades diverged (split) some 300 million years ago.\nAs decoration.\nFlowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\nAs a name.\nSome parents name their girl children after a flower. Some common flower names are: Rose, Lily, Daisy, Holly, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Blossom.\nAs food.\n. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion can be made into wine.\nHoney is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named for the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, and jasmine are used to make tea.\nSpecial meanings.\nFlowers were used to signal meanings in the time when social meetings between men and women was difficult. Lilies made people think of life. Red roses made people think of love, beauty, and passion. In Britain, Australia and Canada, poppies are worn on special holidays as a mark of respect for those who served and died in wars. Daisies made people think of children and innocence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproductive","offset":16},{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":37},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":89},{"uri":"Petal","surface_form":"petal","offset":166},{"uri":"Pollen","surface_form":"pollen","offset":248},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":259},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":310},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":516},{"uri":"Arctic","surface_form":"Arctic","offset":567},{"uri":"Inflorescence","surface_form":"inflorescence","offset":687},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":743},{"uri":"Dissection","surface_form":"dissected","offset":777},{"uri":"Diagram","surface_form":"diagram","offset":829},{"uri":"Floral_formula","surface_form":"floral formula","offset":842},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":867},{"uri":"Flora","surface_form":"flora","offset":910},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"evolution","offset":1118},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":1523},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":1553},{"uri":"Carpel","surface_form":"carpel","offset":1725},{"uri":"Haploid","surface_form":"haploid","offset":2008},{"uri":"Zygote","surface_form":"zygote","offset":2149},{"uri":"Endosperm","surface_form":"endosperm","offset":2246},{"uri":"Fossil","surface_form":"fossil","offset":2556},{"uri":"Lower_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Lower Cretaceous","offset":2635},{"uri":"Gymnosperm","surface_form":"gymnosperm","offset":2729},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":2775},{"uri":"Garden","surface_form":"garden","offset":3120},{"uri":"Gardening","surface_form":"growing flowers","offset":3147},{"uri":"Spice","surface_form":"spice","offset":3669},{"uri":"Saffron","surface_form":"saffron","offset":3676},{"uri":"Crocus","surface_form":"crocus","offset":3700},{"uri":"Clove","surface_form":"clove","offset":3739},{"uri":"Caper","surface_form":"caper","offset":3750},{"uri":"Hops","surface_form":"Hops","offset":3758},{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"beer","offset":3790},{"uri":"Dandelion","surface_form":"Dandelion","offset":3796},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":3823},{"uri":"Honey","surface_form":"Honey","offset":3829},{"uri":"Nectar","surface_form":"nectar","offset":3845},{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bee","offset":3893},{"uri":"Nasturtium","surface_form":"nasturtium","offset":4025},{"uri":"Chrysanthemum","surface_form":"chrysanthemum","offset":4038},{"uri":"Carnation","surface_form":"carnation","offset":4057},{"uri":"Meeting","surface_form":"meeting","offset":4274},{"uri":"Lily","surface_form":"Lilies","offset":4320},{"uri":"Rose","surface_form":"rose","offset":4358},{"uri":"Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":4415},{"uri":"Poppy","surface_form":"poppies","offset":4446},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":4537},{"uri":"Daisy","surface_form":"Daisies","offset":4543}]}
