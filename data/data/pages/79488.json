{"id":79488,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Toro_(roller_coaster)","text":"El Toro, a Spanish term meaning The Bull, is a wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, United States. It was opened on June 11, 2006. It had the steepest drop of any wooden roller coaster in the world, at 76 degrees, until Goliath at Six Flags Great America opened in 2014. It is 188 feet tall, a world record breaking drop on a wooden roller coaster, and goes at a maximum (highest possible) speed of 113 km/h. The speed can sometimes be different. At the beginning of the day, it starts slow, but it goes faster and faster throughout the day. It begins at 108\u00A0km/h and by the end of the day it travels at 118\u00A0km/h. It has 4,400 feet of track, and the trains are known to not really slow down much through the whole ride. El Toro is also known for its strong \"airtime\" (when riders would be thrown out of the seats if the restraints were not there).\nConstruction.\nEl Toro is quite different than most other wooden roller coasters because it is made out prefabricated track, which means that the pieces of track were cut in a factory and do not need to be cut by hand. This makes the time to build El Toro much shorter. Since it uses prefabricated track, the ride is very smooth. Most wooden roller coasters are known to be quite rough.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":47},{"uri":"Roller_coaster","surface_form":"roller coaster","offset":54},{"uri":"Six_Flags_Great_Adventure","surface_form":"Six Flags Great Adventure","offset":72},{"uri":"Jackson%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Jackson","offset":101},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":110},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":122},{"uri":"June_11","surface_form":"June 11","offset":154},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":163},{"uri":"Degree_(geometry)","surface_form":"degrees","offset":243},{"uri":"Goliath_(wooden_roller_coaster","surface_form":"Goliath","offset":258},{"uri":"Six_Flags_Great_America","surface_form":"Six Flags Great America","offset":269},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"feet","offset":319},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"km","offset":441},{"uri":"Hour","surface_form":"h","offset":444},{"uri":"Railway_track","surface_form":"track","offset":673},{"uri":"Prefabricate","surface_form":"prefabricate","offset":989}]}
