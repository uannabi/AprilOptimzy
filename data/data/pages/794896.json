{"id":794896,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Parker_King","text":"Phillip Parker King (13 December 1791 \u2013 26 February 1856) was an explorer, Royal Navy officer and politician from the colony of New South Wales. He is known as an early explorer of the Australian coastline. He also took part in the survey of Patagonian coasts. He also served as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. In 1855, he was named as a rear admiral on the retired list. He was also a member of the Royal Society.\nKing was born on Norfolk Island. He was the son of Anna Josepha (\"n\u00E9e\" Coombe) and Philip Gidley King. He was named after his father's mentor, Arthur Phillip, the first governor of New South Wales and founder of the British penal colony which later became the city of Sydney. This explains the difference in spelling of his and his father's first names.\nKing married Harriet Lethbridge in 1817. The couple had eight children. Two of his sons, Philip Gidley (named after his grandfather) and John, were both pastoralists and politicians. King died in North Sydney on 26 February 1856 at the age of 64.\nThere are many instances of things named after King. King Sound of the Kimberley in Western Australia is named after him. There are also six reptile species named after King: \"Amphisbaena kingii\", \"Chlamydosaurus kingii\", \"Egernia kingii\", \"Elgaria kingii\", \"Hydrophis kingii\" and \"Liolaemus kingii\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":75},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":128},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":185},{"uri":"Patagonia","surface_form":"Patagonia","offset":242},{"uri":"New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council","surface_form":"New South Wales Legislative Council","offset":295},{"uri":"Rear_admiral","surface_form":"rear admiral","offset":359},{"uri":"Royal_Society","surface_form":"Royal Society","offset":421},{"uri":"Norfolk_Island","surface_form":"Norfolk Island","offset":453},{"uri":"Anna_Josepha_King","surface_form":"Anna Josepha","offset":487},{"uri":"N%C3%A9e","surface_form":"n\u00E9e","offset":502},{"uri":"Philip_Gidley_King","surface_form":"Philip Gidley King","offset":519},{"uri":"Arthur_Phillip","surface_form":"Arthur Phillip","offset":579},{"uri":"New_South_Wales","surface_form":"New South Wales","offset":617},{"uri":"Sydney","surface_form":"Sydney","offset":704},{"uri":"Philip_King_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"Philip Gidley","offset":879},{"uri":"John_King_(Australian_politician)","surface_form":"John","offset":927},{"uri":"North_Sydney","surface_form":"North Sydney","offset":986},{"uri":"King_Sound","surface_form":"King Sound","offset":1090},{"uri":"Kimberley_(Western_Australia)","surface_form":"Kimberley","offset":1108},{"uri":"Western_Australia","surface_form":"Western Australia","offset":1121},{"uri":"Amphisbaena_kingii","surface_form":"Amphisbaena kingii","offset":1213},{"uri":"Chlamydosaurus_kingii","surface_form":"Chlamydosaurus kingii","offset":1235},{"uri":"Egernia_kingii","surface_form":"Egernia kingii","offset":1260},{"uri":"Elgaria_kingii","surface_form":"Elgaria kingii","offset":1278},{"uri":"Hydrophis","surface_form":"Hydrophis kingii","offset":1296},{"uri":"Liolaemus","surface_form":"Liolaemus kingii","offset":1319}]}
