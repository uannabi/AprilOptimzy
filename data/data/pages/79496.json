It is named after Galatea, one of the Nereids of Greek legend.\nGalatea was found in late July 1989 from the images taken by the \"Voyager 2\" probe. It was given the designation S/1989\u00A0N\u00A04. The discovery was said (IAUC 4824) on August 2, 1989, but the text only talks of \"10 frames taken over 5 days\", giving a discovery date of sometime before July 28. The name was given on 16 September 1991.\nIt is not a sphere and shows no sign of any geological changes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Neptune%27s_moons","surface_form":"moon to Neptune","offset":45},{"uri":"Galatea_(mythology)","surface_form":"Galatea","offset":80},{"uri":"Nereids","surface_form":"Nereids","offset":100},{"uri":"Greek_Mythology","surface_form":"Greek legend","offset":111},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":191},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"probe","offset":202},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"sphere","offset":467}]}
