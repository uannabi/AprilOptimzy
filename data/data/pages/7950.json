{"id":7950,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_kilometre","text":"=\"preserve\">A square kilometer (sometimes written \"km\u00B2\") is based on the SI unit of measurement of area, the \"square meter\". It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to 1 kilometer (1000 meters). This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is, on a farm or in a city, for example.\nOne square kilometer is just less than 0.39 square miles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":73},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"unit of measurement","offset":76},{"uri":"Area","surface_form":"area","offset":99},{"uri":"Square_(geometry)","surface_form":"square","offset":149},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometer","offset":186},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"square mile","offset":368}]}
