{"id":795121,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_14%2C_2020","text":"A total solar eclipse will occur on Monday, December 14, 2020. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, which will cover the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth.\nA total solar eclipse happens when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality happens in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.\nThe Moon\u2019s apparent diameter will be larger because the eclipse will occur only 1.8 days after perigee, the point at which the Moon is closest to the Earth (on December 12, 2020).\nIt will be visible from Chile and Argentina. There will also be a partial solar eclipse in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Solar_eclipse","surface_form":"solar eclipse","offset":8},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":95},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":115},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":129},{"uri":"Apparent_diameter","surface_form":"apparent diameter","offset":241},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":699},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":709},{"uri":"Bolivia","surface_form":"Bolivia","offset":766},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":775},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":783},{"uri":"Paraguay","surface_form":"Paraguay","offset":792},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":802},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":811}]}
