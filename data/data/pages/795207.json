{"id":795207,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(logic)","text":"In mathematics and logic, a converse is a variant of an implication. More specifically, given an implication of the form formula_1, the converse is the statement formula_1.\nWhile a converse is similar to its originating implication, they are not logically equivalent. This means that the truth of an implication does not guarantee the truth of its converse (and vice versa).\nAs a logical connective, the converse of formula_1 and formula_1 can be represented by the symbol formula_1 (as in formula_1).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":19},{"uri":"Implication_(logic)","surface_form":"implication","offset":56},{"uri":"Logical_equivalence","surface_form":"logically equivalent","offset":246},{"uri":"Logical_connective","surface_form":"logical connective","offset":380}]}
