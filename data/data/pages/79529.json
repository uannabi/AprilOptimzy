{"id":79529,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin","text":"Bedouins are an Arab ethnocultural group. They are descended from nomads who lived in the Arabian, Syrian and Saharan Deserts.\nThey call themselves the \"people of the tent\", because they travelled around, living in tents. Bedouin were camel raisers and drivers, sheep and goat nomads, cattle driving nomads, and merchants. Today many Bedouin have given up the nomadic life and live and work in towns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arab","surface_form":"Arab","offset":16},{"uri":"Nomad","surface_form":"nomad","offset":66},{"uri":"Arabian_Desert","surface_form":"Arabian","offset":90},{"uri":"Syrian_Desert","surface_form":"Syrian","offset":99},{"uri":"Sahara","surface_form":"Saharan Deserts","offset":110},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchant","offset":312}]}
