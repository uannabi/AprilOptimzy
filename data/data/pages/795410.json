{"id":795410,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree","text":"e=\"preserve\">In computer science, a binary tree is a type of tree (data structure) where each item\nwithin the tree has at most two children.\nArray.\nA binary tree can be implemented using an array by storing its level-order traversal. In a zero-indexed array, the root is often stored at index 1.\nReferences.\nIn a programming language with references, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree structure which contains references to its left child and its right child.\nPre-order.\nThe current item is visited, then the left branch is visited, and then the right branch is visited.\nIn-order.\nThe left branch is visited, then the current item is visited, and then the right branch is visited.\nPost-order.\nThe left branch is visited, the right branch is visited, and then the current item is visited.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer_science","surface_form":"computer science","offset":16},{"uri":"Tree_(data_structure)","surface_form":"tree (data structure)","offset":61},{"uri":"Programming_language","surface_form":"programming language","offset":313}]}
