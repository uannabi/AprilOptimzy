It was cancelled after five episodes.\n\"Game Over\" (the title was inspired by the phrase \"game over\" that commonly concludes video games) focused on what happens to video game characters after the game ends. The show recounted the lives of the Smashenburns, a far-from-ordinary suburban family that lives in an alternate video game universe.\nThe show made numerous references to video games and even featured certain game characters as cameos. For example, \"Crash Bandicoot\" appears on a Got Milk? billboard whilst creatures from ' appear in one of the episodes.\nMarisa Tomei voiced Raquel Smashenburn in the series' unaired pilot episode, but scheduling problems made Lucy Liu take over the role for the actual series.\n\"Game Over\" was heavily hyped by UPN before its debut. The series generally received positive press upon its airing. Despite this, only six episodes were made, which aired on a variety of different days \u2013 the fourth and fifth episodes were broadcast on April 2, 2004 and the sixth episode (\"Monkey Dearest\") was not aired.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":22},{"uri":"Adult_animation","surface_form":"adult","offset":31},{"uri":"Animated_sitcom","surface_form":"computer-animated sitcom","offset":37},{"uri":"David_Sacks","surface_form":"David Sacks","offset":73},{"uri":"Nickelodeon_Animation_Studio","surface_form":"Nickelodeon Animation Studio","offset":122},{"uri":"The_Carsey-Werner_Company","surface_form":"Carsey-Werner Productions","offset":165},{"uri":"UPN","surface_form":"UPN","offset":208},{"uri":"Game_over","surface_form":"game over","offset":310},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":498},{"uri":"Crash_Bandicoot_(character)","surface_form":"Crash Bandicoot","offset":678},{"uri":"Got_Milk%3F","surface_form":"Got Milk?","offset":708},{"uri":"Marisa_Tomei","surface_form":"Marisa Tomei","offset":783},{"uri":"Lucy_Liu","surface_form":"Lucy Liu","offset":889}]}
