Wyntoun and John Barbour (\"The Brus\", 1375) were the first people to write about history in the Scots language.\nHe wrote a long poetic history of Scotland, called the \"Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland\", which included Scotland's mythical pre-history and finished when King James I came to power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scottish_people","surface_form":"Scottish","offset":94},{"uri":"Canon_(official)","surface_form":"canon","offset":111},{"uri":"John_Barbour","surface_form":"John Barbour","offset":221},{"uri":"The_Brus","surface_form":"The Brus","offset":236},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":290},{"uri":"Scots","surface_form":"Scots language","offset":305},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetic","offset":337},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":355},{"uri":"Orygynale_Cronykil_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland","offset":377},{"uri":"Mythology","surface_form":"mythical","offset":436},{"uri":"James_I_of_Scotland","surface_form":"King James I","offset":475}]}
