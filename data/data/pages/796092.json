{"id":796092,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Player_Rule","text":"The Designated Player Rule, nicknamed the Beckham Rule, allows Major League Soccer franchises to sign up to three players that would be considered outside their salary cap (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player). The rule was adopted ahead of the 2007 MLS season, and it enables teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market. The rule is one of two ways which MLS teams may exceed their salary cap, the other being allocation money. As of December 2019, there have been 209 Designated Players in league history.\nThe rule is informally named after David Beckham, in anticipation of MLS teams signing lucrative deals with internationally recognized players of Beckham's caliber. Beckham was the first player signed under this rule, signing a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy with a guaranteed annual salary of $6.5 million.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Major_League_Soccer","surface_form":"Major League Soccer","offset":63},{"uri":"Salary_cap","surface_form":"salary cap","offset":161},{"uri":"Allocation_money","surface_form":"allocation money","offset":486},{"uri":"David_Beckham","surface_form":"David Beckham","offset":618},{"uri":"Los_Angeles_Galaxy","surface_form":"Los Angeles Galaxy","offset":839}]}
