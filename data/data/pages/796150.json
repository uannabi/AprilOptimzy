{"id":796150,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution","text":"e=\"preserve\">In probability, the geometric distribution with probability of success formula_1, written formula_1, is a discrete probability distribution defined on non-negative integers. It is used to model the number of trials needed to obtain a first success, where the probability of success of each trial is formula_1.\nAn example involving geometric distribution is the number of times a die needs to be tossed in order to get a first heads.\nThe geometric distribution is the discrete analogue of the exponential distribution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Probability_theory","surface_form":"probability","offset":16},{"uri":"Probability_distribution","surface_form":"probability distribution","offset":128},{"uri":"Exponential_distribution","surface_form":"exponential distribution","offset":505}]}
