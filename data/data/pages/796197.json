{"id":796197,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Forman","text":"Charlotte Forman (1715\u20131787) was a journalist, translator, political essayist and activist. Between 1756 and 1780, she wrote political essays and news from abroad for newspapers under pseudonyms (false names). The false name she used in the newspapers \"Gazetteer\" and \"The Public Ledger\" was \"Probus\".\nShe was not famous in her lifetime, but she has become more well known in recent years. This is because she was one of the few women at that time who wrote essays on politics and trade. Back then, people thought those were men's areas of interest. Because of sexism, most people thought Forman's essays were written by men.\nScholars say her essays show great knowledge and morality.\nEarly life.\nForman's father was Irish Jacobite Charles Forman, and her mother was called Mary. Forman had five brothers and sisters.\nCharles Forman was a clerk in the English war office. When James Francis Edward Stuart tried become king of England, Ireland and Scotland (and make royal House of Stuart the rulers of these countries) in the Jacobite rising of 1715, Forman was late in sending orders to the English general Charles Wills, who was fighting the Jacobites. Therefore, we do not know whether Charlotte was born in England or France, but she did later write that she had been \"nursed in the palace of the Trianon\" in France.\nShe lived in London for most of her life in poverty, and went into debtors' prison for a short time in 1767.\nWriting career.\nForman wrote a many political essays for the \"Gazetteer\" and \"London Daily Advertiser\" between 1756 and 1760, then carried in in the \"Public Ledger\" in 1760. Both newspapers were for merchants, traders, and shopkeepers in London, and had information about to international trade, such as news about shipping and offers of wholesale and retail goods..\nForman's essays in the \"Gazetteer\" and the \"Public Ledger\", all signed as Probus, were written in the before and during the Seven Years' War. About 200 surviving essays comment on diplomatic news and general news reports, as well as looking into the interests of England, Prussia, France, Holland, Austria, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. She always supported the English war effort, and kept telling readers that England could defeat France, as well as defending Frederick the Great and William Pitt from critics. She also argued against an early peace, as she thought it would give France too much leeway.\nLetters written between her and with Radical satirist and politician John Wilkes have beensaid to give modern readers \"graphic evidence of the struggles of an independent woman in the 18th century attempting to support herself by writing\". She said she was a literary day labourer.\nShe is not known to have published anything under her own name, although there are many works published anonymously which now cannot be attributed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Essay","surface_form":"essays","offset":135},{"uri":"Pseudonym","surface_form":"pseudonyms","offset":184},{"uri":"Women","surface_form":"women","offset":429},{"uri":"Politics","surface_form":"politics","offset":468},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":481},{"uri":"Sexism","surface_form":"sexism","offset":561},{"uri":"Men","surface_form":"men","offset":621},{"uri":"Knowledge","surface_form":"knowledge","offset":661},{"uri":"Morality","surface_form":"morality","offset":675},{"uri":"Jacobitism","surface_form":"Jacobite","offset":723},{"uri":"Clerk","surface_form":"clerk","offset":839},{"uri":"James_Francis_Edward_Stuart","surface_form":"James Francis Edward Stuart","offset":877},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_England","surface_form":"England","offset":926},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":935},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":947},{"uri":"House_of_Stuart","surface_form":"House of Stuart","offset":972},{"uri":"Jacobite_rising_of_1715","surface_form":"Jacobite rising of 1715","offset":1026},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1334},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":1365},{"uri":"Merchant","surface_form":"merchants","offset":1629},{"uri":"Traders","surface_form":"traders","offset":1640},{"uri":"Shopkeepers","surface_form":"shopkeepers","offset":1653},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1668},{"uri":"International_trade","surface_form":"international trade","offset":1705},{"uri":"Wholesale","surface_form":"wholesale","offset":1768},{"uri":"Retail","surface_form":"retail","offset":1782},{"uri":"Good_(economics)","surface_form":"goods","offset":1789},{"uri":"Seven_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Seven Years' War","offset":1921},{"uri":"Diplomatics","surface_form":"diplomatic news","offset":1977},{"uri":"Interest","surface_form":"interests","offset":2047},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":2069},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":2078},{"uri":"Holland","surface_form":"Holland","offset":2086},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":2095},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":2104},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":2112},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Sweden","offset":2119},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":2131},{"uri":"Frederick_II_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Frederick the Great","offset":2265},{"uri":"Satire","surface_form":"satirist","offset":2454}]}
