{"id":796268,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium-26","text":"e=\"preserve\">Aluminium-26 (26Al, Al-26) is a radioactive isotope of aluminium. It decays by either positron emission or electron capture to magnesium-26. The half-life of 26Al is 7.17\u00D7105 years. A small amount of aluminium-26 is made when atoms hit cosmic ray protons.\nWhen aluminium-26 decays it also produces gamma rays and x-rays. Because it is radioactive, it is usually kept behind at least 5 centimetres (2 in) of lead. We use special tools to transfer, use, and store aluminium-26.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Radioisotope","surface_form":"radioactive isotope","offset":45},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminium","offset":68},{"uri":"Radioactive_decay","surface_form":"decays","offset":82},{"uri":"Positron_emission","surface_form":"positron emission","offset":99},{"uri":"Electron_capture","surface_form":"electron capture","offset":120},{"uri":"Magnesium-26","surface_form":"magnesium-26","offset":140},{"uri":"Half-life_(element)","surface_form":"half-life","offset":158},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atoms","offset":239},{"uri":"Cosmic_ray","surface_form":"cosmic ray","offset":249},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"protons","offset":260},{"uri":"Gamma_ray","surface_form":"gamma rays","offset":311},{"uri":"X-ray","surface_form":"x-rays","offset":326},{"uri":"Lead","surface_form":"lead","offset":420}]}
