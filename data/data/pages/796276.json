{"id":796276,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_the_Tiger","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Eye of the Tiger\" is a 1982 hard rock song under the American rock band Survivor. This rock ballad was from the hard rock studio album of the same name. It was recorded under the request of the actor Sylvester Stallone for his boxing drama movie \"Rocky III\". That happened when rock group Queen didn't give him permission to use the song \"Another One Bites the Dust\" in his movie. The movie version had tiger growls within it.\nIn the United States, \"Eye of the Tiger\" hit #1 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It stayed at #1 for six weeks.\nThe song was nominated for a 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Song. This was the only nomination for \"Rocky III\". It lost to \"Up Where We Belong\" from \"An Officer and a Gentleman\". It was also nominated for a 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. It lost, though, to Willie Nelson's hit \"Always on My Mind\".\nIn 2012, Survivor sued Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich in Illinois federal court. Gingrich had been using \"Eye of the Tiger\" without asking permission in his political rallies dating back to 2009.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hard_rock","surface_form":"hard rock","offset":42},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":67},{"uri":"Survivor_(band)","surface_form":"Survivor","offset":86},{"uri":"Studio_album","surface_form":"studio album","offset":136},{"uri":"Recording_(music)","surface_form":"recorded","offset":174},{"uri":"Sylvester_Stallone","surface_form":"Sylvester Stallone","offset":214},{"uri":"Boxing","surface_form":"boxing","offset":241},{"uri":"Drama_movie","surface_form":"drama movie","offset":248},{"uri":"Rocky_III","surface_form":"Rocky III","offset":261},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":292},{"uri":"Queen_(band)","surface_form":"Queen","offset":303},{"uri":"Tiger","surface_form":"tiger","offset":417},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":448},{"uri":"Billboard_Hot_100","surface_form":"\"Billboard\" Hot 100","offset":501},{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":587},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":771},{"uri":"Willie_Nelson","surface_form":"Willie Nelson","offset":826},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican","offset":890},{"uri":"Newt_Gingrich","surface_form":"Newt Gingrich","offset":924},{"uri":"Illinois","surface_form":"Illinois","offset":941}]}
