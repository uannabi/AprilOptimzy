{"id":796284,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort","text":"This is the same as with quicksort, developed in 1960. The difference is that with merge sort, dividing the lists is trivial, and merging them together isn't. With quicksort, dividing the lists is more complex, but the merging step is trivial.\nAlso note that merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, while quicksort isn't.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quicksort","surface_form":"quicksort","offset":25},{"uri":"Stable_sorting_algorithm","surface_form":"stable sorting algorithm","offset":275}]}
