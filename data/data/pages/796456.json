{"id":796456,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum_and_supremum","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics, the infimum or greatest lower bound of a set \"A\", written as formula_1, is the greatest element among all lower bounds of \"A\". Similarly, the supremum or least upper bound of \"A\", written as formula_1, is the smallest element among all upper bounds of \"A\".\nFor example, if \"A\" is the set formula_1, then formula_1 and formula_1. Infimum and supremum are unique, if they exist. Infimum and supremum are key concepts in the field of mathematical analysis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Set","surface_form":"set","offset":70},{"uri":"Lower_bound","surface_form":"lower bounds","offset":135},{"uri":"Upper_bound","surface_form":"upper bounds","offset":265},{"uri":"Mathematical_analysis","surface_form":"mathematical analysis","offset":460}]}
