{"id":79658,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereid_(moon)","text":"Nereid or Neptune\u00A0II, is a moon of Neptune.\nNereid was found on 1 May 1949 by Gerard Kuiper, who suggested the name in the report of his discovery. It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology.\nIt was the farthest of Neptune's known moons for a long time (Halimede through Neso have since taken that honour), and is the third biggest, with a diameter of 340\u00A0km. Its orbit averages 5,513,400\u00A0km in radius, but is very eccentric and varies from 1,353,600 to 9,623,700 kilometres. For a long time this was the most highly eccentric orbit of any known moon in the solar system, but Bestla, a more recently discovered moon of Saturn has a more eccentric orbit. The unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured asteroid or Kuiper belt object, or possibly that it was perturbed during the capture of Neptune's largest moon Triton. Very little else is known of Nereid.\nNereid was too far to be properly imaged by the \"Voyager 2\" probe when it visited the Neptune system in 1989. Photos sent back show only its very non-spherical shape, and no surface features could be seen at the resolution available.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":27},{"uri":"Neptune_(planet)","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":35},{"uri":"Gerard_Kuiper","surface_form":"Gerard Kuiper","offset":78},{"uri":"Nereids","surface_form":"Nereids","offset":170},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":193},{"uri":"Halimede_(moon)","surface_form":"Halimede","offset":272},{"uri":"Neso_(moon)","surface_form":"Neso","offset":289},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":382},{"uri":"Eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentric","offset":433},{"uri":"Solar_system","surface_form":"solar system","offset":576},{"uri":"Bestla_(moon)","surface_form":"Bestla","offset":594},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":637},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":725},{"uri":"Kuiper_belt","surface_form":"Kuiper belt","offset":737},{"uri":"Triton_(moon)","surface_form":"Triton","offset":836},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":930},{"uri":"Space_probe","surface_form":"probe","offset":941},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":1031}]}
