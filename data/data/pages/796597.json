{"id":796597,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3","text":"e=\"preserve\">Helium-3 (3He) is a light, stable isotope of helium. It has two protons and one neutron. Helium-3 was discovered in 1939.\nHelium-3 occurs as a primordial nuclide. It escapes from the Earth's crust into the atmosphere. It then escape into outer space over millions of years. Helium-3 is also thought to be a natural nucleogenic and cosmogenic nuclide. The amount of helium-3 is thought to be greater on the Moon than on Earth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Isotope","surface_form":"isotope","offset":47},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":58},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"protons","offset":77},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":93},{"uri":"Primordial_nuclide","surface_form":"primordial nuclide","offset":156},{"uri":"Earth%27s_crust","surface_form":"Earth's crust","offset":196},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":219},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":251},{"uri":"Nucleogenic_nuclide","surface_form":"nucleogenic","offset":328},{"uri":"Cosmogenic_nuclide","surface_form":"cosmogenic nuclide","offset":344},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":419},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":432}]}
