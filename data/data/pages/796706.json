{"id":796706,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Truro","text":"=\"preserve\">The Truro River is located in Truro, a city in southern Cornwall. It flows from two rivers named Kenwyn and Allen. The Truro River flows into the River Fal, where there is a lot of wildlife. The river valleys surround the city on the north, east and west and open to the Truro River in the south. Flood defences have been constructed around the city (as there was a major flood there in 1988) including an emergency dam and a tidal barrier.\nThe Truro River has many shipwrecks in it. This is because Truro's laws about who must remove damaged boats are different from other parts of the U.K.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":68},{"uri":"Shipwreck","surface_form":"shipwreck","offset":478}]}
