{"id":796714,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama%2C_Goa","text":"Vasco da Gama (), often shortened to Vasco, is a city in the state of Goa on the west coast of India. It is named after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. It is the headquarters of the Mormug\u00E3o taluka (subdistrict). The city lies on the western tip of the Mormugao peninsula, at the mouth of the Zuari River, about from Panaji, Goa's capital, and about from Dabolim Airport.\nThe city was founded in 1543 and remained in Portuguese hands until 1961, when it became part of India. The 1888 constructed Mormugao Port remains a busy shipping route in Asia. It is one of the major ports of independent India. The ship-building area of Goa Shipyard Limited that builds Navy and Coast Guard vessels was also built here in 1957 (during the Portuguese-era). Initially built around the city's harbour as the barge-repair yard \"Estaleiros Navais de Goa,\" the area has now expanded to include more related activities. The Indian Navy also has a presence in Mormugao, with its vast campuses, which include the naval base INS Hansa that shares control over the Dabolim Airport enclave.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Goa","surface_form":"Goa","offset":70},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":95},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":124},{"uri":"Vasco_da_Gama","surface_form":"Vasco da Gama","offset":144},{"uri":"Mormugao_taluk","surface_form":"Mormug\u00E3o taluka","offset":189},{"uri":"Zuari_River","surface_form":"Zuari River","offset":300},{"uri":"Panaji","surface_form":"Panaji","offset":324},{"uri":"Dabolim_Airport","surface_form":"Dabolim Airport","offset":362},{"uri":"Goa_Shipyard","surface_form":"Goa Shipyard Limited","offset":634},{"uri":"Indian_Navy","surface_form":"Navy","offset":667},{"uri":"Indian_Coast_Guard","surface_form":"Coast Guard","offset":676},{"uri":"Indian_Navy","surface_form":"Indian Navy","offset":914},{"uri":"INS_Hansa","surface_form":"INS Hansa","offset":1012},{"uri":"Goa_International_Airport","surface_form":"Dabolim Airport","offset":1051}]}
