King Louis XIV of France wanted him to be elected. George was a Lutheran, but Poland was Roman Catholic, so John Sobieski was chosen instead.\nBecause George was Protestant, people thought he would be a good husband for Anne, Queen of Great Britain. She was just Lady Anne at the time. George and Anne were married on 28 July 1683. The wedding was in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, London. The guests included King Charles II, Queen Catherine, and the Duke and Duchess of York.\nWhen King William III died in 1702, Anne became queen.\nGeorge died on 28 October 1708.
