{"id":797247,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions","text":"In mathematics, hyperbolic functions are analogues of the ordinary trigonometric functions, but defined for the unit hyperbola rather than on the unit circle: just as the points form a circle with a unit radius, the points form the right half of the hyperbola.\nHyperbolic functions occur in the calculations of angles and distances in hyperbolic geometry. They also occur in the solutions of many linear differential equations, cubic equations, and Laplace's equation in Cartesian coordinates. Laplace's equations are important in many areas of physics.\ncorresponding to the derived trigonometric functions.\nThe hyperbolic functions take a real argument called a hyperbolic angle. The size of a hyperbolic angle is twice the area of its hyperbolic sector. The hyperbolic functions may be defined in terms of the legs of a right triangle covering this sector.\nHyperbolic functions were introduced in the 1760s independently by Vincenzo Riccati and Johann Heinrich Lambert.\nDefinitions.\nThere are various equivalent ways to define the hyperbolic functions.\nUseful relations.\nThe hyperbolic functions satisfy many identities, all of them similar in form to the trigonometric identities.\nThus, and are even functions; the others are odd functions.\nthe last of which is similar to the Pythagorean trigonometric identity.\nComparison with circular functions.\nThe hyperbolic functions represent an expansion of trigonometry beyond the functions defined on unit circle. Both types depend on one argument, either circular angle or hyperbolic angle.\nSince the area of a circular sector with radius \"r\" and angle \"u\" (in radians) is \"r\"2\"u\"/2, it will be equal to \"u\" when \"r\" =. In the diagram, such a circle is tangent to the hyperbola \"xy\" = 1 at (1,1). The yellow sector depicts an area and angle magnitude. Similarly, the yellow and red sectors together depict an area and hyperbolic angle magnitude.\nThe legs of the two right triangles with hypotenuse on the ray defining the angles are of length times the circular and hyperbolic functions.\nRelationship to the exponential function.\nThe decomposition of the exponential function in its even and odd parts gives the identities\nThe first one is analogous to Euler's formula","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":3},{"uri":"Trigonometric_function","surface_form":"trigonometric function","offset":67},{"uri":"Hyperbola","surface_form":"hyperbola","offset":117},{"uri":"Circle","surface_form":"circle","offset":151},{"uri":"Unit_circle","surface_form":"circle with a unit radius","offset":185},{"uri":"Hyperbola","surface_form":"hyperbola","offset":250},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_geometry","surface_form":"hyperbolic geometry","offset":335},{"uri":"Differential_equation","surface_form":"differential equation","offset":404},{"uri":"Cubic_function","surface_form":"cubic equations","offset":428},{"uri":"Laplace%27s_equation","surface_form":"Laplace's equation","offset":449},{"uri":"Cartesian_coordinates","surface_form":"Cartesian coordinates","offset":471},{"uri":"Laplace%27s_equation","surface_form":"Laplace's equation","offset":494},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":545},{"uri":"Real_number","surface_form":"real argument","offset":640},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_angle","surface_form":"hyperbolic angle","offset":663},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_sector","surface_form":"hyperbolic sector","offset":737},{"uri":"Right_triangle","surface_form":"legs of a right triangle","offset":812},{"uri":"Vincenzo_Riccati","surface_form":"Vincenzo Riccati","offset":926},{"uri":"Johann_Heinrich_Lambert","surface_form":"Johann Heinrich Lambert","offset":947},{"uri":"Trigonometric_identity","surface_form":"trigonometric identities","offset":1158},{"uri":"Even_function","surface_form":"even function","offset":1198},{"uri":"Odd_functions","surface_form":"odd functions","offset":1229},{"uri":"Pythagorean_trigonometric_identity","surface_form":"Pythagorean trigonometric identity","offset":1280},{"uri":"Trigonometry","surface_form":"trigonometry","offset":1403},{"uri":"Argument_of_a_function","surface_form":"argument","offset":1486},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"circular angle","offset":1503},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_angle","surface_form":"hyperbolic angle","offset":1521},{"uri":"Hyperbolic_sector","surface_form":"hyperbolic angle magnitude","offset":1866},{"uri":"Right_triangle","surface_form":"right triangle","offset":1914},{"uri":"Even%E2%80%93odd_decomposition","surface_form":"even and odd parts","offset":2131},{"uri":"Euler%27s_formula","surface_form":"Euler's formula","offset":2201}]}
