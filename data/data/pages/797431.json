Paty was beheaded by Abdoullakh Abouyedovich Anzorov, an 18-year-old Muslim, Russian refugee of Chechen origin.\nAnzorov killed and beheaded Paty with a knife, and was shot and killed by police minutes later. Anzorov murdered Paty because the teacher had shown his students a \"Charlie Hebdo\" cartoon showing the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that the event was \"a typical Islamist terrorist attack\", and that \"our compatriot was killed for teaching children freedom of speech\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":42},{"uri":"Middle-school","surface_form":"middle-school","offset":49},{"uri":"Conflans-Sainte-Honorine","surface_form":"Conflans-Sainte-Honorine","offset":105},{"uri":"Suburb","surface_form":"suburb","offset":133},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":143},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":150},{"uri":"Decapitation","surface_form":"beheaded","offset":167},{"uri":"Islam_in_France","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":227},{"uri":"Russians","surface_form":"Russian","offset":235},{"uri":"Refugee","surface_form":"refugee","offset":243},{"uri":"Chechens","surface_form":"Chechen","offset":254},{"uri":"Charlie_Hebdo","surface_form":"Charlie Hebdo","offset":434},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":469},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":477},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":485},{"uri":"French_President","surface_form":"French President","offset":495},{"uri":"Emmanuel_Macron","surface_form":"Emmanuel Macron","offset":512}]}
