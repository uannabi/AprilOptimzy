He was known for his interest in general relativity in the United States. Wheeler also worked with Niels Bohr in explaining the basic principles behind nuclear fission.\nHe is best known for using the term \"black hole\" and for inventing the terms \"quantum foam\", \"neutron moderator\", \"wormhole\" and \"it from bit\", and for hypothesizing the \"one-electron universe\".\nOn April 13, 2008, Wheeler died of pneumonia at the age of 96 in Hightstown, New Jersey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theoretical_physicist","surface_form":"theoretical physicist","offset":68},{"uri":"General_relativity","surface_form":"general relativity","offset":124},{"uri":"Niels_Bohr","surface_form":"Niels Bohr","offset":190},{"uri":"Nuclear_fission","surface_form":"nuclear fission","offset":243},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":297},{"uri":"Quantum_foam","surface_form":"quantum foam","offset":338},{"uri":"Neutron_moderator","surface_form":"neutron moderator","offset":354},{"uri":"Wormhole","surface_form":"wormhole","offset":375},{"uri":"It_from_bit","surface_form":"it from bit","offset":390},{"uri":"One-electron_universe","surface_form":"one-electron universe","offset":431},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":490},{"uri":"Hightstown%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Hightstown, New Jersey","offset":520}]}
