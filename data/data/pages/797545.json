{"id":797545,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Thai_protests","text":"The ongoing 2020 Thai protests are a series of protests against the government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, which have included demands for reform of the Thai monarchy.\nThe protests were initially caused by the ending of the Future Forward Party in late February 2020. The party was critical of Prayut. This first wave of protests was held on academic campuses and stopped by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe protests started again on 18 July in a large demonstration organized under the Free Youth umbrella at the Democracy Monument.\nFollowing mass protests on 14 October, a \"severe\" state of emergency, which gave more emergency powers to the authorities compared to those given by the Emergency Decree since March, was declared in Bangkok on the 15, citing the alleged blocking of a royal motorcade.\nProtests continued despite the ban, prompting a crackdown by police on 16 October.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prayut_Chan-o-cha","surface_form":"Prayut Chan-o-cha","offset":97},{"uri":"Monarchy_of_Thailand","surface_form":"Thai monarchy","offset":162},{"uri":"Future_Forward_Party","surface_form":"Future Forward Party","offset":233},{"uri":"COVID-19_pandemic_in_Thailand","surface_form":"COVID-19 pandemic","offset":388},{"uri":"Democracy_Monument","surface_form":"Democracy Monument","offset":517},{"uri":"State_of_emergency","surface_form":"state of emergency","offset":587}]}
