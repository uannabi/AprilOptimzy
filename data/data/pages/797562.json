He discovered lithium in 1817 by isolating it as a salt.\nLife and work.\nArfwedson was born in January 12, 1792. His family was very rich. His father was Jacob Arfwedson and his mother was Anna Elisabeth Holtermann. Arfwedson became a student at the Uppsala University in 1803. He completed a degree in Law in 1809 and a second degree in mineralogy in 1812. Later in the year, he received an position in the Royal Board of Mines.\nIn Stockholm, Arfwedson knew the chemist J\u00F6ns Jakob Berzelius. He got access to his private laboratory, which is where he discovered lithium in 1817, during analysis of the mineral petalite.\nHe was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1821.\nThe rare mineral arfvedsonite was named after him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":65},{"uri":"Chemist","surface_form":"chemist","offset":73},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":96},{"uri":"Salt_(chemistry)","surface_form":"salt","offset":133},{"uri":"Uppsala_University","surface_form":"Uppsala University","offset":331},{"uri":"Academic_degree","surface_form":"degree","offset":374},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"Law","offset":384},{"uri":"Mineralogy","surface_form":"mineralogy","offset":419},{"uri":"Stockholm","surface_form":"Stockholm","offset":514},{"uri":"J%C3%B6ns_Jakob_Berzelius","surface_form":"J\u00F6ns Jakob Berzelius","offset":552},{"uri":"Analysis","surface_form":"analysis","offset":668},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":684},{"uri":"Petalite","surface_form":"petalite","offset":692},{"uri":"Elected","surface_form":"elected","offset":709},{"uri":"Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","surface_form":"Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","offset":733},{"uri":"Arfvedsonite","surface_form":"arfvedsonite","offset":793}]}
