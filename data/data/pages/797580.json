If the woman gets married, it's a marriage of convenience.\nThis type of relationship is called gold digging.\nThe term \"gold digger\" was a slang term which has its roots in the 20th century. It is especially popular with chorus girls and sex workers.\n\"Gold digger\" rose in usage after the popularity of Avery Hopwood's play \"The Gold Diggers\" in 1919.\nSongs about gold diggers include \"Gold Digger\" from Kanye West and \"Gold Digger\" from EPMD. Both reference women marrying for money.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":73},{"uri":"Good_(economics)","surface_form":"good","offset":86},{"uri":"Marriage","surface_form":"marriage","offset":144},{"uri":"Avery_Hopwood","surface_form":"Avery Hopwood","offset":412},{"uri":"Kanye_West","surface_form":"Kanye West","offset":513},{"uri":"EPMD","surface_form":"EPMD","offset":547}]}
