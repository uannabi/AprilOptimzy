{"id":797592,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDF","text":"Electricite de France S.A. (EDF; \"Electricity of France\") is a French power company. It is mostly owned by the government of France. Its headquarters are in Paris. It earned \u20AC71.2 billion in revenues in 2016. EDF produces 120+ gigawatts of electricity in Europe, South America, North America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nIts 58 active nuclear reactors (in France) are spread out over 20 sites (nuclear power plants). There are 34 reactors with 900 MWe, 20 reactors with 1300 MWe, and 4 reactors with 1450 MWe, all PWRs.\nIn 2017, EDF was scheduled to take over most of the power business of Areva, in a French government sponsored restructuring following financial and technical problems at Areva. In July 2017, France's Environmental Minister Nicolas Hulot said that up to 17 of France's nuclear power reactors \u2014 all of which are operated by EDF \u2014 could be closed by 2025 because of a new law about using less nuclear power.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":63},{"uri":"Electric_utility","surface_form":"power","offset":70},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":157},{"uri":"Gigawatts","surface_form":"gigawatts","offset":227},{"uri":"Nuclear_reactors","surface_form":"nuclear reactors","offset":341},{"uri":"Nuclear_power_plants","surface_form":"nuclear power plants","offset":400},{"uri":"MWe","surface_form":"MWe","offset":454},{"uri":"MWe","surface_form":"MWe","offset":481},{"uri":"Pressurized_water_reactor","surface_form":"PWR","offset":520},{"uri":"Areva","surface_form":"Areva","offset":596},{"uri":"Nicolas_Hulot","surface_form":"Nicolas Hulot","offset":749}]}
