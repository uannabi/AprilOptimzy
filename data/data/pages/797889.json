{"id":797889,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Riots","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Gordon Riots were mass rioting in London, England in 1780.\nThe riots started as a non-violent protest. In 1778 Parliament had passed the Catholic Relief Act, which stopped some oppression of people who practiced the Roman Catholic Christian religion. For example, it said Catholics could join the army without saying an oath that was against their religion. British people who practiced the Protestant Catholic religion did not like that. In 1980, Lord Gordon said Parliament should repeal, or take back, that law.\nPeople who agreed with Gordon put blue cockade decorations in their hats and marched across London Bridge. Then they saw some Lords and called them names and attacked their carriages. Then they found some Roman Catholic churches and set them on fire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":51},{"uri":"Catholic_Relief_Act","surface_form":"Catholic Relief Act","offset":154},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":233},{"uri":"Cockade","surface_form":"cockade","offset":571},{"uri":"London_Bridge","surface_form":"London Bridge","offset":624}]}
