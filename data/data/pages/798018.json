Protoplanetary disks have radii up to 1000 AU. Protoplanetary disks have been seen around several young stars in our galaxy.\nProtoplanetary disks are thought to be thin structures. They have mass that is much smaller than the young star in the center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Circumstellar_disc","surface_form":"circumstellar disc","offset":36},{"uri":"Dense","surface_form":"dense","offset":58},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":64},{"uri":"Dust","surface_form":"dust","offset":72},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":97},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radii","offset":150},{"uri":"AU","surface_form":"AU","offset":167},{"uri":"Galaxy","surface_form":"galaxy","offset":241}]}
