Holman \"et al.\" on August 14, 2019.\nSao orbits Neptune at a distance of about 22.4 million km and is about 44 kilometers in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04).\nSao has a very inclined and eccentric orbit seen on the diagram in relation to other non-sperical moons of Neptune.\nSao, or Neptune XI, like many of the farther moons of Neptune, is named after one of the Nereids; Sao was associated with sailing and is referred to as \"The rescuer\" or \"Safety\".
