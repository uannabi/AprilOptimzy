{"id":798166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_wool","text":"Mineral wool is any fibrous material made by spinning or drawing molten mineral or rock materials such as slag and ceramics. Mineral wool was first made in 1840 in Wales by Edward Parry. Mineral wool has an average diameter of 2 to 6 micrometers.\nHow mineral wool is made.\nStone wool which is a type of mineral wool is made by spinning molten rock in very fast spinning heads which is a bit like the way cotton candy is made. Mineral wool may contain a binder, often a terpolymer, and an oil to reduce dusting.\nUses.\nMineral wool is used as insulators and sound absorbers. It is used in resin bonded panels, as filler in compounds for gaskets, in brake pads, in plastics in the automotive industry, as a filtering medium, and as a growth medium in hydroponics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fibre","surface_form":"fibrous","offset":20},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":28},{"uri":"Mineral","surface_form":"mineral","offset":72},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":83},{"uri":"Slag","surface_form":"slag","offset":106},{"uri":"Ceramic","surface_form":"ceramics","offset":115},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":215},{"uri":"Micrometre","surface_form":"micrometers","offset":234},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"molten rock","offset":336},{"uri":"Cotton_candy","surface_form":"cotton candy","offset":404},{"uri":"Binder","surface_form":"binder","offset":453},{"uri":"Terpolymer","surface_form":"terpolymer","offset":469},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":488},{"uri":"Gasket","surface_form":"gaskets","offset":635},{"uri":"Brake_pad","surface_form":"brake pads","offset":647},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastics","offset":662},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":689},{"uri":"Filter","surface_form":"filtering","offset":704},{"uri":"Growth","surface_form":"growth","offset":731},{"uri":"Hydroponics","surface_form":"hydroponics","offset":748}]}
