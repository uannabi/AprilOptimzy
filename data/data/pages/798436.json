{"id":798436,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_bromide","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lithium bromide (LiBr) is a chemical compound. It is made up of lithium and bromine. It is used as a desiccant in certain air conditioning systems.\nPreparation.\nLithium bromide is made by treating an aqueous solution of lithium carbonate with hydrobromic acid or by reacting lithium hydroxide with bromine.\nUses.\nLithium bromide is used in air-conditioning systems as desiccant. It is also used as a salt in absorption chilling along with water (see absorption refrigerator). Solid lithium bromide is used as a reagent in organic synthesis. It is also used for deprotonation and dehydration of organic compounds containing acidic protons. It is also used for the purification of steroids and prostaglandins.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":41},{"uri":"Lithium","surface_form":"lithium","offset":77},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":89},{"uri":"Desiccant","surface_form":"desiccant","offset":114},{"uri":"Air_conditioning","surface_form":"air conditioning","offset":135},{"uri":"Aqueous_solution","surface_form":"aqueous solution","offset":213},{"uri":"Lithium_carbonate","surface_form":"lithium carbonate","offset":233},{"uri":"Hydrobromic_acid","surface_form":"hydrobromic acid","offset":256},{"uri":"Lithium_hydroxide","surface_form":"lithium hydroxide","offset":288},{"uri":"Bromine","surface_form":"bromine","offset":311},{"uri":"Salt","surface_form":"salt","offset":413},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":452},{"uri":"Absorption_refrigerator","surface_form":"absorption refrigerator","offset":463},{"uri":"Deprotonation","surface_form":"deprotonation","offset":574},{"uri":"Dehydration","surface_form":"dehydration","offset":592},{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compounds","offset":607},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"protons","offset":643},{"uri":"Steroid","surface_form":"steroids","offset":692},{"uri":"Prostaglandin","surface_form":"prostaglandins","offset":705}]}
