{"id":798486,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_cobalt_oxide","text":"=\"preserve\">Lithium cobalt oxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is LiCoO2. It is sometimes called lithium cobaltate or lithium cobaltite. Lithium cobalt oxide is a dark blue or bluish-gray crystalline solid. It is commonly used in the positive electrodes of lithium-ion batteries.\nPreparation.\nLithium cobalt oxide can be made by heating a stoichiometric mixture of lithium carbonate and cobalt(II,III) oxide or metallic cobalt at 600\u2013800\u00B0C, then annealing it at 900\u00B0C for many hours, all under an oxygen atmosphere.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_compound","surface_form":"chemical compound","offset":38},{"uri":"Chemical_formula","surface_form":"chemical formula","offset":61},{"uri":"Crystal","surface_form":"crystalline solid","offset":203},{"uri":"Electrode","surface_form":"electrodes","offset":258},{"uri":"Lithium-ion_battery","surface_form":"lithium-ion batteries","offset":272},{"uri":"Stoichiometry","surface_form":"stoichiometric","offset":354},{"uri":"Mixture","surface_form":"mixture","offset":369},{"uri":"Lithium_carbonate","surface_form":"lithium carbonate","offset":380},{"uri":"Cobalt(II%2CIII)_oxide","surface_form":"cobalt(II,III) oxide","offset":402},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metallic","offset":426},{"uri":"Cobalt","surface_form":"cobalt","offset":435},{"uri":"Annealing","surface_form":"annealing","offset":461},{"uri":"Oxygen","surface_form":"oxygen","offset":512}]}
