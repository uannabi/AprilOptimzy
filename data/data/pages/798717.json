In the spring and summer, it can be found in the Great Lakes region and the Great Plains region.\nFeeding.\nEastern red bats are insectivorous. They mainly eat moths. But, they also eat other insects. They eat many pests, like gypsy moths, tent caterpillar moths, \"Cydia\" moths, \"Acrobasis\" moths, cutworm moths, and coneworm moths.\nReproduction.\nEastern red bat breeding season starts in the autumn. Many males can mate with one female. Pups are born in the summer. Eastern red bats usually give birth to three pups. Eastern red bat pups learn to fly when they are a month old. After learning how to fly they are weaned. Even after the pups have learned how to fly, they stay with their mother for a short time before staying by themselves.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Microbat","surface_form":"microbat","offset":55},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":71},{"uri":"Vespertilionidae","surface_form":"Vespertilionidae","offset":78},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":138},{"uri":"Bermuda","surface_form":"Bermuda","offset":178},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":204},{"uri":"Fur","surface_form":"fur","offset":217},{"uri":"Continental_divide","surface_form":"Continental Divide","offset":595},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":634},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":658},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":673},{"uri":"Southeastern_United_States","surface_form":"southeastern United States","offset":700},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":744},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coastal","offset":772},{"uri":"Spring","surface_form":"spring","offset":794},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":805},{"uri":"Great_Lakes","surface_form":"Great Lakes","offset":836},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":848},{"uri":"Great_Plains","surface_form":"Great Plains","offset":863},{"uri":"Insectivorous","surface_form":"insectivorous","offset":914},{"uri":"Moth","surface_form":"moths","offset":945},{"uri":"Insect","surface_form":"insects","offset":977},{"uri":"Pest_(biology)","surface_form":"pests","offset":1000},{"uri":"Lymantria_dispar","surface_form":"gypsy moths","offset":1012},{"uri":"Tent_caterpillar","surface_form":"tent caterpillar moths","offset":1025},{"uri":"Cydia","surface_form":"Cydia","offset":1050},{"uri":"Acrobasis","surface_form":"Acrobasis","offset":1065},{"uri":"Cutworm","surface_form":"cutworm moths","offset":1083},{"uri":"Coneworm","surface_form":"coneworm moths","offset":1102},{"uri":"Breeding_season","surface_form":"breeding season","offset":1148},{"uri":"Autumn","surface_form":"autumn","offset":1178},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":1244},{"uri":"Weaning","surface_form":"weaned","offset":1399}]}
