It is a conservation status. The IUCN Red List is one group that decides which species are conservation dependent and which are not.\nSome conservation-dependent species live in zoos or aquariums. Others live in places that park rangers and other people protect from illegal hunters. So some conservation-dependent species are extinct in the wild and others are not.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Endangered","surface_form":"endangered","offset":95},{"uri":"Extinction","surface_form":"die out","offset":109},{"uri":"Conservation_status","surface_form":"conservation status","offset":158},{"uri":"IUCN_Red_List","surface_form":"IUCN Red List","offset":183},{"uri":"Zoo","surface_form":"zoo","offset":327},{"uri":"Aquarium","surface_form":"aquarium","offset":335},{"uri":"Poaching","surface_form":"illegal hunters","offset":416},{"uri":"Extinct_in_the_wild","surface_form":"extinct in the wild","offset":476}]}
