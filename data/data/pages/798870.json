The Seminole bat has a mahogany color with a frosted look because to white tipped dorsal hairs. They weigh around 12 grams. Females are larger than males.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nThe Seminole bat is found in the Southeastern United States. This includes Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and parts of Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina. It has also been seen as far as Mexico. It is a migratory species. In the winter, it lives along the Gulf Coast, North and South Carolina, and southern Arkansas. In the summer, they migrate as far north as Missouri and Kentucky.\nIt prefers to live in forested areas. In winter, they are found to use leaf litter and Spanish moss as insulation in their roost sites.\nFeeding.\nSeminole bats are insectivores. They eat large amounts of Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (moths). They have also been shown to eat smaller amounts of Homoptera (cicadas) and Diptera (flies).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bat","surface_form":"bat","offset":53},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":64},{"uri":"Vespertilionidae","surface_form":"Vespertilionidae","offset":71},{"uri":"Mahogany","surface_form":"mahogany","offset":178},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":187},{"uri":"Hair","surface_form":"hairs","offset":244},{"uri":"Southeastern_United_States","surface_form":"Southeastern United States","offset":369},{"uri":"Louisiana","surface_form":"Louisiana","offset":411},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":422},{"uri":"Alabama","surface_form":"Alabama","offset":431},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":440},{"uri":"South_Carolina","surface_form":"South Carolina","offset":453},{"uri":"Texas","surface_form":"Texas","offset":481},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":488},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":499},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":512},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":560},{"uri":"Migratory","surface_form":"migratory","offset":576},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":586},{"uri":"Winter","surface_form":"winter","offset":602},{"uri":"Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Gulf Coast","offset":629},{"uri":"Arkansas","surface_form":"Arkansas","offset":680},{"uri":"Summer","surface_form":"summer","offset":697},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":734},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":747},{"uri":"Forest","surface_form":"forested","offset":779},{"uri":"Plant_litter","surface_form":"leaf litter","offset":828},{"uri":"Spanish_moss","surface_form":"Spanish moss","offset":844},{"uri":"Thermal_insulation","surface_form":"insulation","offset":860},{"uri":"Insectivore","surface_form":"insectivores","offset":920},{"uri":"Hymenoptera","surface_form":"Hymenoptera","offset":960},{"uri":"Ant","surface_form":"ants","offset":973},{"uri":"Bee","surface_form":"bees","offset":979},{"uri":"Wasp","surface_form":"wasps","offset":988},{"uri":"Coleoptera","surface_form":"Coleoptera","offset":996},{"uri":"Lepidoptera","surface_form":"Lepidoptera","offset":1018},{"uri":"Moth","surface_form":"moths","offset":1031},{"uri":"Homoptera","surface_form":"Homoptera","offset":1091},{"uri":"Cicada","surface_form":"cicadas","offset":1102},{"uri":"Diptera","surface_form":"Diptera","offset":1115}]}
