{"id":798897,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was a court-like system that was created in South Africa after the end of apartheid. Witnesses who were victims of gross human rights violations during apartheid were invited to give statements about their experiences, and some were selected for public hearings.\nPerpetrators of violence could also give testimony and request amnesty from both civil and criminal prosecution.\nThe TRC, the first of the 1003 held internationally to stage public hearings, was seen by many as a crucial component of the transition to full and free democracy in South Africa. It was controversial to some because many people who committed crimes were either acquitted or never prosecuted.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":103},{"uri":"Apartheid","surface_form":"apartheid","offset":133},{"uri":"Apartheid","surface_form":"apartheid","offset":211},{"uri":"Amnesty","surface_form":"amnesty","offset":385},{"uri":"Transitional_justice","surface_form":"transition","offset":560},{"uri":"Democracy","surface_form":"democracy","offset":588}]}
