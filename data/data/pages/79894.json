{"id":79894,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorticity","text":"Vorticity is a mathematical concept used in fluid dynamics. It can be related to the amount of \"circulation\" or \"rotation\" (or more strictly, the local angular rate of rotation) in a fluid.\nThe average vorticity in a small region of fluid flow is equal to the circulation formula_1 around the boundary of the small region, divided by the area A of the small region.\nOne of the base assumptions of the potential flow assumption is that the vorticity formula_1 is zero almost everywhere, except in a boundary layer or a stream-surface immediately bounding a boundary layer.\nBecause a vortex is a region of concentrated vorticity, the non-zero vorticity in these specific regions can be modelled with vortices.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematical","offset":15},{"uri":"Fluid_dynamics","surface_form":"fluid dynamics","offset":44},{"uri":"Circulation_(fluid_dynamics)","surface_form":"circulation","offset":96},{"uri":"Circulation_(fluid_dynamics)","surface_form":"circulation","offset":260},{"uri":"Potential_flow","surface_form":"potential flow","offset":401},{"uri":"Boundary_layer","surface_form":"boundary layer","offset":498},{"uri":"Stream-surface","surface_form":"stream-surface","offset":518},{"uri":"Boundary_layer","surface_form":"boundary layer","offset":556},{"uri":"Vortex","surface_form":"vortex","offset":582}]}
