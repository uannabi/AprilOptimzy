{"id":79901,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn","text":"Popcorn is a snack food made by heating certain kinds of corn. There is a small amount of water inside the seeds, which causes them to explode. When the seed shell breaks a sharp noise is made. The name \"pop\" is because of this noise. After it pops it is white and fluffy.\nSalt and melted butter is often added to popcorn. Sometimes caramel and other flavours are melted and mixed into the popcorn.\nPopcorn is a popular food to eat at the cinema.\nKernel choking.\nMany accidents of choking on popcorn kernels were reported. This is because the popcorn kernel does go into the airway and throat, and gets stuck. Many people want other people to take kernels out of the popcorn for children.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Snack","surface_form":"snack","offset":13},{"uri":"Food","surface_form":"food","offset":19},{"uri":"Corn","surface_form":"corn","offset":57},{"uri":"Explosion","surface_form":"explode","offset":135},{"uri":"Cinema","surface_form":"cinema","offset":439},{"uri":"Airway","surface_form":"airway","offset":575},{"uri":"Throat","surface_form":"throat","offset":586}]}
