{"id":79905,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen","text":"John Bardeen (23 May 1908 \u2013 30 January 1991) was an American physicist and electrical engineer. He is the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in Physics.\nBardeen was born in Madison, Wisconsin. His father, Charles Bardeen was a Professor at the Medical School of the University of Wisconsin. He completed his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He completed his PhD in Physics at Princeton University in 1936.\nBardeen worked with William Shockley and Walter Brattain to invent the transistor on 23 December 1947. They shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1956.\nLater, Bardeen worked with Leon Cooper and John Robert Schrieffer. They created the BCS theory of superconductivity, named after them. For this work they shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1972.\nBardeen was a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1951 to 1991.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":52},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":61},{"uri":"Electrical_engineer","surface_form":"electrical engineer","offset":75},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prizes in Physics","offset":129},{"uri":"Madison%2C_Wisconsin","surface_form":"Madison, Wisconsin","offset":174},{"uri":"University_of_Wisconsin-Madison","surface_form":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","offset":380},{"uri":"Princeton_University","surface_form":"Princeton University","offset":448},{"uri":"William_Shockley","surface_form":"William Shockley","offset":498},{"uri":"Walter_Brattain","surface_form":"Walter Brattain","offset":519},{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":549},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physics","offset":597},{"uri":"Leon_Cooper","surface_form":"Leon Cooper","offset":657},{"uri":"John_Robert_Schrieffer","surface_form":"John Robert Schrieffer","offset":673},{"uri":"Superconductivity","surface_form":"superconductivity","offset":728},{"uri":"University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","surface_form":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","offset":897}]}
