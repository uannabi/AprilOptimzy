{"id":799380,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan_Japanese","text":"Okinawan Japanese (\u6C96\u7E04\u548C\u5927\u548C\u53E3, \"Uchinaa-yamatuguchi\") is a form of the Japanese language in the islands of Okinawa. It comes from Standard Japanese, but many words are taken from the Okinawan and Kunigami languages. It is spoken by much of Okinawa and is used a lot by younger people.\nOkinawan Japanese formed because of language mixing between Okinawan and Japanese. This happened because the Okinawa Islands were being assimilated by mainland Japan. The same thing also happened in the Amami Islands, causing Amami Japanese to form.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese language","offset":67},{"uri":"Okinawa","surface_form":"Okinawa","offset":103},{"uri":"Standard_Japanese","surface_form":"Standard Japanese","offset":126},{"uri":"Okinawan_language","surface_form":"Okinawan","offset":179},{"uri":"Kunigami_language","surface_form":"Kunigami","offset":192},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":441},{"uri":"Amami_Islands","surface_form":"Amami Islands","offset":484},{"uri":"Amami_Japanese","surface_form":"Amami Japanese","offset":507}]}
