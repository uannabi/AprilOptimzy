{"id":799386,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_threats","text":"e=\"preserve\">On the 29 October 2020, a man threatened people with a gun in Avignon, Vaucluse, France. He was Fabien Badaroux, who claimed to be part of the far-right identitarian group G\u00E9n\u00E9ration identitaire. This could not be confirmed. The group said the man was not one of their members. Badaroux argued with a person from the Maghreb. A bystander alerted the police. Badaroux was killed by police, wanting to arrest him at 11.15 local time. The attack is not classified as terrorism. Later, the threatened driver told police that Badaroux had done a Nazi salute, and charged his weapon, before threatening him. According to some sources, Badaroux was treated in a psychiatric hospital nearby. He was a local man from Avignon, aged 33.\nThis incident took place on the same day as a triple killing in Nice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Avignon","surface_form":"Avignon","offset":75},{"uri":"Vaucluse","surface_form":"Vaucluse","offset":84},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":94},{"uri":"Far-right","surface_form":"far-right","offset":156},{"uri":"Identitarian_movement","surface_form":"identitarian","offset":166},{"uri":"G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ration_identitaire","surface_form":"G\u00E9n\u00E9ration identitaire","offset":185},{"uri":"Maghreb","surface_form":"Maghreb","offset":330},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":363},{"uri":"Terrorism","surface_form":"terrorism","offset":477},{"uri":"Nazi_salute","surface_form":"Nazi salute","offset":554},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":583},{"uri":"Psychiatric_hospital","surface_form":"psychiatric hospital","offset":668},{"uri":"2020_Nice_stabbing","surface_form":"triple killing in Nice","offset":785}]}
