{"id":799631,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Molave_(2020)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Typhoon Molave, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Quinta, was a powerful typhoon that impacted the Philippines and later Vietnam in October 2020, becoming the strongest to strike Vietnam since Typhoon Damrey in 2017.\nThe eighteenth named storm and eighth typhoon of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season, Molave started from a tropical depression that formed on October 23 east of Palau.\nAt 15:00 UTC the next day, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Molave as it moved northwestward. Molave soon became a typhoon on October 25 as it turned west, shortly before making landfall on the San Miguel Island in Albay, with another in Malinao, San Andres, Torrijos and Pola.\nAfter striking the Philippines, Molave entered the South China Sea and began to become more violent. Molave strengthened into a powerful Category 3 typhoon later that day, before weakening again as it approached Vietnam. The typhoon struck Vietnam on October 28, before rapidly weakening as it headed further into Indochina.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":42},{"uri":"Typhoon","surface_form":"typhoon","offset":88},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":136},{"uri":"Typhoon_Damrey_(2017)","surface_form":"Typhoon Damrey","offset":208},{"uri":"Named_storm","surface_form":"named storm","offset":247},{"uri":"Typhoon","surface_form":"typhoon","offset":270},{"uri":"2020_Pacific_typhoon_season","surface_form":"2020 Pacific typhoon season","offset":285},{"uri":"Tropical_depression","surface_form":"tropical depression","offset":336},{"uri":"Palau","surface_form":"Palau","offset":390},{"uri":"Landfall_(meteorology)","surface_form":"landfall","offset":590},{"uri":"San_Miguel_Island_(Philippines)","surface_form":"San Miguel Island","offset":606},{"uri":"Albay","surface_form":"Albay","offset":627},{"uri":"Malinao%2C_Albay","surface_form":"Malinao","offset":650},{"uri":"San_Andres%2C_Quezon","surface_form":"San Andres","offset":659},{"uri":"Torrijos%2C_Marinduque","surface_form":"Torrijos","offset":671},{"uri":"Pola%2C_Oriental_Mindoro","surface_form":"Pola","offset":684},{"uri":"South_China_Sea","surface_form":"South China Sea","offset":741}]}
