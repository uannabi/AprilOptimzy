{"id":799956,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elomar","text":"Elomar (born December 21 1937) is a Brazilian writer, singer and composer. He wrote a very large amount of music, including works for Opera and vocal works. His music was influenced by both Brazilian folk music from the northeast region of Brazil and by Medieval music from Europe.\nLeomar brings to his songs the regional aspects of the sub-regions of the Northeast Region of Brazil. His use of language closely follows the dialect of inhabitants of the sert\u00E3o, employing regional terms and variations of words, as well as borrowing chivalric romances traditions and customs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"December_21","surface_form":"December 21","offset":13},{"uri":"1937","surface_form":"1937","offset":25},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":36},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":46},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":54},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":65},{"uri":"Opera","surface_form":"Opera","offset":134},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":171},{"uri":"Folk_music","surface_form":"folk music","offset":200},{"uri":"Medieval_music","surface_form":"Medieval music","offset":254},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":274},{"uri":"Chivalric_romance","surface_form":"chivalric romances","offset":533}]}
