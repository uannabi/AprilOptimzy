{"id":8,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A","text":"A or a is the first letter of the English alphabet. The small letter, a or \u03B1, is used as a lower case vowel.\nWhen it is spoken, \u0101 is said as a long a, a diphthong of \u0115 and y. A is similar to alpha of the Greek alphabet. That is not surprising, because it stands for the same sound.\n\"Alpha and omega\" (the last letter of the Greek alphabet) means from beginning to the end. In musical notation, the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below B and above G. In binary numbers, the letter A is 01000001.\nA is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old TV show, The A-Team. A capital a is written \"A\". Use a capital a at the start of a sentence if writing.\nWhere it came from.\nThe letter 'A' was in the Phoenician alphabet's aleph. This symbol came from a simple picture of an ox head.\nThis Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter alpha. The Greek alphabet was used by the Etruscans in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.\nUsing the letter.\nThe letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like \u00E6, in the International Phonetic Alphabet, such as the word \"pad\". Other sounds of this letter are in the words \"father\", which developed into another sound, such as in the word \"ace\".\nUse in mathematics.\nIn algebra, the letter \"A\" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.\nIn geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label line segments, lines, etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":34},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":42},{"uri":"Vowel","surface_form":"vowel","offset":102},{"uri":"Diphthong","surface_form":"diphthong","offset":153},{"uri":"Alpha_(letter)","surface_form":"alpha","offset":191},{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":204},{"uri":"Omega_(letter)","surface_form":"omega","offset":293},{"uri":"Musical_notation","surface_form":"musical notation","offset":376},{"uri":"B","surface_form":"B","offset":451},{"uri":"G","surface_form":"G","offset":463},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":469},{"uri":"TV","surface_form":"TV","offset":571},{"uri":"The_A-Team","surface_form":"The A-Team","offset":580},{"uri":"Aleph","surface_form":"aleph","offset":743},{"uri":"Ox","surface_form":"ox","offset":795},{"uri":"Alpha_(letter)","surface_form":"alpha","offset":952},{"uri":"Etruscan_civilization","surface_form":"Etruscans","offset":994},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"International Phonetic Alphabet","offset":1184},{"uri":"Line_segment","surface_form":"line segment","offset":1555},{"uri":"Line_(geometry)","surface_form":"lines","offset":1570}]}
