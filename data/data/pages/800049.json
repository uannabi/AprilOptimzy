{"id":800049,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Eta","text":"Hurricane Eta was a Category\u00A04 hurricane that caused almost-total damage for parts of Central America in early November\u00A02020. The twenty-eighth named storm, twelfth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the very active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Eta originated from a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October\u00A031. The system rapidly organized as it moved west, with the cyclone becoming a Category\u00A04 hurricane on November\u00A03. Peaking with winds of 150\u00A0mph (240\u00A0km/h) and 923\u00A0mbar, it was the third most intense November Atlantic hurricane on record, behind the 1932 Cuba hurricane, and Hurricane Iota just two weeks later. Some weakening took place as the system made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, late that same day. Eta rapidly weakened to a tropical depression as it moved across Central America for two days before moving north over water. It later reorganized over the Caribbean as it quickly moved toward Cuba on November\u00A07. Over the next five days, the system moved oddly, moving through the Florida Keys, before moving into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Only reaching hurricane strength for a short time, it weakened once more and quickly moved across the Southeastern United States on November\u00A012. It soon became extratropical and dissipated the next day.\nHurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings were issued along the coast of Honduras and Northeastern Nicaragua as Eta approached. More than 10,000\u00A0people went to shelters in Puerto Cabezas and surrounding villages. Eta knocked down power lines and trees while damaging roofs and causing flooding in Puerto Cabezas. At least 178\u00A0fatalities across Central America have been related to the storm, including 74 in Honduras, 53 in Guatemala, 27 in Mexico, 19 in Panama, two each in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and one in El Salvador. Once the system began to reorganize in the Caribbean, tropical storm watches were issued on November\u00A05, in the Cayman Islands. More watches were issued in parts of Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, and South Florida. Eta brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. South Florida was already dealing with overflowing rivers that forced evacuations. Heavy rainfall and tropical-storm force winds were recorded across all of the Florida Keys, South Florida and the southern half of Central Florida, bringing bad flooding. Eta's second landfall brought storm surge and gusty winds to the west coast of Central Florida and much needed rainfall to northern Florida. One person was killed in Florida after being electrocuted in floodwaters from Eta. Water from the storm also worked together with a cold front further to the north, bringing heavy rainfall and flash flooding to the Carolinas and Virginia, killing another five people in these states. 11\u00A0deaths were related to the storm in the U.S. Nearly $8 billion in damages have been reported across all affected areas by Eta as of December 2020.\nRelief efforts for those affected by the storm were very popular in several countries. About 2.5\u00A0million were affected by the storm, including 1.7\u00A0million in Honduras. Many Emergency Response Units were to help support affected people. About 98\u00A0tons of food and water were given to Nicaragua and Honduras from Panama. People left homeless were moved to many shelters after the storm had passed. Donations worth millions of USD had been given to affected countries to help recoveries. However, just two weeks later, all efforts were distracted greatly by Hurricane Iota.\nStorm history.\nOn October\u00A028, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) started watching the Southwestern Caribbean. There was an area that might become a tropical cyclone. At 12:00\u00A0UTC on October\u00A029, the area of interest turned to two tropical waves coming together moving into the Eastern Caribbean, still supposed to enter the region. The disturbance steadily moved westward into a better environment for development. This allowed it to become better organized on October\u00A031, but there was some question as to if it had formed a good circulation. However, by 21:00\u00A0UTC that day, satellite and microwave imagery said that a circulation had formed, and the NHC began issuing advisories on \"Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine\". At 03:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A01, the system intensified into \"Tropical Storm Eta\", becoming the earliest 28th\u00A0non-extratropical storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season, beating Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005.\nContinuing west because of a ridge, Eta slowly organized throughout the day as cold convection began to form on top of its center. After barely holding onto tropical storm strength for 15\u00A0hours, Eta began to intensify quickly, reaching hurricane status at 09:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A02. Six hours later, the storm turned into a high-end Category\u00A02 hurricane as a tiny eye became apparent in satellite imagery. Eta then reached Category\u00A03 status at 18:00\u00A0UTC before becoming a Category\u00A04 hurricane three hours later, with lots of lightning being observed in its eyewall. Eta begun to slow down and turn west-southwestward because of a ridge over the United States. At 03:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A03, a airplane found the system still intensifying quickly with winds of 150\u00A0mph (240\u00A0km/h) and a pressure of 927\u00A0mbar as it still slowed. According to the NHC, Eta maintained its peak winds as it reached its lowest pressure of 923\u00A0mbar at 06:00\u00A0UTC, marking its peak intensity as a strong Category\u00A04 hurricane. \"The Washington Post\" said that several experts thought Eta peaked as a Category\u00A05 hurricane based on satellite imagery as well as a lack of aircraft due to several issues. Still in a in a good location, Eta began to weaken six hours after its peak because of an eyewall replacement cycle, which it completed as it made landfall at 21:00\u00A0UTC south of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, with winds of 140\u00A0mph (225\u00A0km/h) and a pressure of 940\u00A0mbar. Land caused Eta to rapidly weaken as it moved slowly west after landfall with its eye disappearing and its convection weakening. It fell below major hurricane status just three hours after landfall at 00:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A04. Eta continued to weaken rapidly, dropping to tropical storm status at 09:00\u00A0UTC, and to a tropical depression at 00:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A05.\nEven though the storm was messy, Eta still held on to tropical cyclone status, and began turning northeastward, eventually moving back over the Caribbean Sea on November\u00A06 and speeding up due to the influence of a developing trough over the Gulf of Mexico. On November\u00A07, following a couple of center reformations, the system became better organized and became a tropical storm again, at 15:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A07. Even with strong wind shear, the storm continued to strengthen through the day and reached a second peak of winds of 65\u00A0mph (100\u00A0km/h) and a pressure of 991\u00A0mbar at 00:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A08. It then held its strength and slowed slightly before making landfall on the south central coast of Cuba at 09:00\u00A0UTC. Eta weakened after making landfall in Cuba's Sancti Sp\u00EDritus Province, but this was short as it quickly moved back over water in the Atlantic Ocean and began to strengthen again as it turned northwestward around the northeastern side of a low that had formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea near the Isle of Youth.\nEta briefly gained a eye feature before bad conditions removed most of its convection, although the storm was able to maintain its intensity as it grew in size and approached South Florida. At 04:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A09, Eta made its third landfall on the Lower Matecumbe Key in the Florida Keys with the same intensity as its Cuban landfall. It then passed just south of the southwestern coast of Florida as it turned westward. Eta then turned southwestward under the influence of a strong ridge across the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and near the US East Coast. This also brought it into an area of really dry air, causing the storm to weaken and its area of gale-force winds to shrink. However, even after its center became sheared to the west of its convection, Eta began to intensify again over the warm waters of the Gulf. Eta than began to speed up north-northeast around the western edge of a subtropical ridge as its center reformed under the convection and an eye formed. Eta then regained minimal hurricane status at 12:35\u00A0UTC on November\u00A011, reaching a fourth peak intensity with winds of 75\u00A0mph (120\u00A0km/h) and a pressure of 983\u00A0mbar.\nShortly after its peak, dry air rapidly removed the convection and caused the eye to be gone, causing Eta to weaken back into a tropical storm at 18:00\u00A0UTC. The system turned further east and made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida at 09:00\u00A0UTC on November\u00A012, with winds of 50\u00A0mph (85\u00A0km/h). The storm weakened over land as it sped toward the north-northeastward, eventually emerging over the waters of the Atlantic near the Florida\u2013Georgia border at 18:00\u00A0UTC. Eta came out with winds of 40\u00A0mph (65\u00A0km/h) before restrengthening as it began its extratropical transition. The storm completed its transition on November\u00A013. On the next day, Eta was absorbed into another frontal system to the north.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["hurricane"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":86},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone_naming","surface_form":"named storm","offset":144},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":165},{"uri":"2020_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2020 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":220},{"uri":"Rapid_deepening","surface_form":"rapidly organized","offset":343},{"uri":"Mbar","surface_form":"mbar","offset":492},{"uri":"1932_Cuba_hurricane","surface_form":"1932 Cuba hurricane","offset":578},{"uri":"Hurricane_Iota","surface_form":"Hurricane Iota","offset":603},{"uri":"Puerto_Cabezas%2C_Nicaragua","surface_form":"Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua","offset":699},{"uri":"Florida_Keys","surface_form":"Florida Keys","offset":1027},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":1073},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":1249},{"uri":"Honduras","surface_form":"Honduras","offset":1373},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Northeastern Nicaragua","offset":1386},{"uri":"Puerto_Cabezas","surface_form":"Puerto Cabezas","offset":1472},{"uri":"Central_America","surface_form":"Central America","offset":1644},{"uri":"Cayman_Islands","surface_form":"Cayman Islands","offset":1936},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":2012},{"uri":"The_Carolinas","surface_form":"the Carolinas","offset":2721},{"uri":"Virginia","surface_form":"Virginia","offset":2739},{"uri":"USD","surface_form":"USD","offset":3367},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":3548},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":3614},{"uri":"Atmospheric_circulation","surface_form":"circulation","offset":4045},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical","offset":4342},{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"Atlantic hurricane season","offset":4378},{"uri":"Tropical_Storm_Zeta_(2005)","surface_form":"Tropical Storm Zeta","offset":4413},{"uri":"2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2005","offset":4436},{"uri":"Ridge_(meteorology)","surface_form":"ridge","offset":4471},{"uri":"Eye_(cyclone)","surface_form":"eye","offset":4804},{"uri":"Lightning","surface_form":"lightning","offset":4965},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":5085},{"uri":"The_Washington_Post","surface_form":"The Washington Post","offset":5437},{"uri":"Puerto_Cabezas%2C_Nicaragua","surface_form":"Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua","offset":5787},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Mexico","surface_form":"Gulf of Mexico","offset":6480},{"uri":"Sancti_Sp%C3%ADritus_Province","surface_form":"Sancti Sp\u00EDritus Province","offset":7005},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":7093},{"uri":"Isle_of_Youth","surface_form":"Isle of Youth","offset":7264},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"South Florida","offset":7454},{"uri":"Florida_Keys","surface_form":"Florida Keys","offset":7559},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":7674},{"uri":"Cedar_Key%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Cedar Key, Florida","offset":8631},{"uri":"Georgia_(U.S._state)","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":8852}]}
