{"id":80017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Article_Number","text":"The European Article Number (often shortened to \"EAN\") is a standard to encode product numbers. The EAN is a special case of a Global Trade Item Number. The EAN is made of either 8 or 13 digits (EAN-8, and EAN-13). In many cases, the EAN allows to uniquely identify the item. Most of the time, the EAN is printed on the packaging of a product. Special scanners are able to decode these numbers. They then look up the product-specific data (such as the price) and print it on the bill, for exampe.\nNote that the EAN is often encoded using a barcode (such as the ones in the example), but this does not have to be thecase. There are other machine-readable codes which can also be used.\nEAN-8/GTIN-8.\nThere are special organisations which give out both EAN-8 and EAN-13 numbers. Since EAN-8 numbers with a starting digit 2 are free use, many retailers (such as Aldi) use them for their own products. As an example, Aldi uses EAN-8 codes starting with 290 or 221; 290 and 221 are the country-specific parts \"for internal use\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Standard","surface_form":"standard","offset":60},{"uri":"Global_Trade_Item_Number","surface_form":"Global Trade Item Number","offset":127}]}
