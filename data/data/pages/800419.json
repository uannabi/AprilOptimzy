Golden doodles have a curly coat. The coat can be golden, cream, white, or even red!

A Golden doodle needs at least 15 to 30\u00A0minutes of exercise three times a day. When a puppy, they tend to want to play interactive games like fetch, but as they grow older, they enjoy a gentle stroll. Haircuts are necessary for Golden doodles every six weeks. This will keep the fur from tangles or matting. Make sure to take your Golden doodle out every 45-60\u00A0minutes.\nFeeding.\nGolden doodle puppies need to be fed 4 small meals a day. When your puppy grows up to 6 months old, you can feed the golden doodle larger meals twice a day.\nTraining.\nGolden doodles are an energetic breed, so training will be much harder. To sit: Hold a treat up in the air over the Golden\u2019s head until it sits. Reward the dog with the treat. To lay down: While the dog is sitting, hold a treat in your hand and wave your free hand up and down while beckoning the dog to lay down. Reward the Golden with the treat when it lays down.\nFinances.\nGolden doodles usually cost around $500 to $4000 depending on where you pick up the pup. Basic dry kibble costs $100-$250 per year. Premium dog kibble will cost around $200-$400 per year. For maintenance, smaller golden doodles cost less than bigger golden doodles.
