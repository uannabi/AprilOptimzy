It later aired on Adult Swim in 2013, although censored.\nPlot.\nDexter has made a Rude Removal machine to remove the rudeness from Dee Dee. They argued on who is the rudest. They got into the machine and made rude and profane clones of themselves while the nice ones have British mannerisms. The rude clones make a mess in the kitchen with their mother around and swear up a storm. They get grounded and decide to ruin Dexter's lab. Dexter and Dee Dee tricked the clones into going to the Rude Removal system, making the two whole. They went to Dee Dee's room and saw their mom with a bar of soap. Dexter ends the episode by saying \"Oh, shit.\"\nProduction.\nGenndy Tartakovsky revealed that the episode was made just for fun and not an actual Dexter episode.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dexter%27s_Laboratory","surface_form":"Dexter's Laboratory","offset":46},{"uri":"Adult_Swim","surface_form":"Adult Swim","offset":178},{"uri":"Genndy_Tartakovsky","surface_form":"Genndy Tartakovsky","offset":815}]}
