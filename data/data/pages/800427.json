{"id":800427,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_%26_Stimpy_%26quot%3BAdult_Party_Cartoon%26quot%3B","text":"\"Ren and Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon\" is an American adult animated cartoon created by John Kricfalusi and based on \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\". It had three episodes aired on Spike TV in 2003 but the last three episodes were unaired until a DVD release. It was much more vulgar than the original show and used constant gross-out and sex jokes.\nProduction.\nSpike TV offered John Kricfalusi to have not only reruns of the original Ren & Stimpy show but also new adult-oriented episodes. Billy West was considered to return as the voice of Stimpy, but he declined due to Kricfalusi's involvement. Eric Bauza would voice Stimpy.\nReception.\nThe adult-oriented cartoon is seen as a major step down from the original cartoon. The pacing of each episode wasn't liked either.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Kricfalusi","surface_form":"John Kricfalusi","offset":87},{"uri":"The_Ren_%26amp%3B_Stimpy_Show","surface_form":"The Ren & Stimpy Show","offset":117},{"uri":"Billy_West","surface_form":"Billy West","offset":482},{"uri":"Eric_Bauza","surface_form":"Eric Bauza","offset":591}]}
