It is mostly set in the human body.\nProduction.\nThe movie was going to be rated PG-13 with raunchy scenes involving Ozzy and Drix visiting Gonad's Gym (Frank's testicles) and that there would be more swearing. The swearing was overdubbed, for example, in the first cut, Ozzy says \"What the hell is a uvula?\" In the final cut, \"hell\" is replaced with \"heck\".\nReception.\nThe movie flopped at the box office with mixed reviews but was able to make it's budget back with home video sales.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Farrelly_brothers","surface_form":"Farrelly brothers","offset":92}]}
