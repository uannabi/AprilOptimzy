{"id":800884,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyds_Banking_Group","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lloyds Bank plc is a British retail and commercial bank with branches across England and Wales. It has traditionally been considered one of the \"Big Four\" clearing banks. The bank was founded in Birmingham in 1765. It expanded during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and took over a number of smaller banking companies. In 1995 it merged with the Trustee Savings Bank and traded as Lloyds TSB Bank plc between 1999 and 2013.\nThe bank is the principal subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group, which was formed in January 2009 by the acquisition of HBOS by the then-Lloyds TSB Group. That year, following the UK bank rescue package, the British Government took a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group. As a condition imposed by the European Commission regarding state aid, the group later announced that it would create a new standalone retail banking business, made up of a number of Lloyds TSB branches and those of Cheltenham & Gloucester. The new business began operations on 9 September 2013 under the TSB brand. Lloyds TSB was subsequently renamed Lloyds Bank on 23 September 2013. On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold.\nLloyds Bank is the largest retail bank in Britain, and has an extensive network of branches and ATM in England and Wales (as well as an arrangement for its customers to be serviced by Bank of Scotland branches in Scotland, Halifax branches in Northern Ireland and vice versa) and offers 24-hour telephone and online banking services. As of 2012 it has 16 million personal customers and small business accounts.\nIt has its operational Headquarters in London and other offices in Wales and Scotland. It also operates a number of office complex, brand headquarters and data centres in Yorkshire including Leeds, Sheffield and Halifax.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"bank","offset":64},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":90},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":102},{"uri":"Clearing_bank","surface_form":"clearing bank","offset":168},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":208}]}
