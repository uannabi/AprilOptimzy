{"id":80093,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_ascent","text":"In climbing, the first climb to reach the top of a mountain is called first ascent.\nThe risks for the climbers are often very high, because the way to the top is not known. That is why first ascents are often carefully recorded as part of the history of a mountain and usually mentioned in books about that mountain.\nSome use the words \"last ascent\" as a joke for a way that was no pleasure and no one wants to do it like the first climbers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Climbing","surface_form":"climbing","offset":3},{"uri":"Climbing_route","surface_form":"climb","offset":23},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":51}]}
