{"id":801023,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100-ball_cricket","text":"=\"preserve\">100-ball cricket is a short form of cricket. The 100 ball game has two teams each having one innings, which ends after 100 legal balls (deliveries), and the game ends in two and a half hours. Overs are done with 5 or 10 balls, rather than 6 balls.\nThe England Cricket Board is starting a 100-ball competition named The Hundred in 2021.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":48},{"uri":"Innings","surface_form":"innings","offset":105},{"uri":"Over_(cricket)","surface_form":"Overs","offset":204},{"uri":"England_Cricket_Board","surface_form":"England Cricket Board","offset":264},{"uri":"The_Hundred","surface_form":"The Hundred","offset":327}]}
