{"id":801094,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal","text":"The Enron scandal was an accounting scandal of Enron Corporation, which was an American energy company. It caused the company to go bankrupt in 2001 after people found out about the scandal. The company Arthur Andersen also ended because of it, as they did not audit the company correctly. Arthur Anderson was one of the five largest audit companies in the world. Enron was often said to be the worst audit failure in history.\nEnron's shareholders filed a lawsuit of $40 billion after the stock price of the company went from US$90.75 to less than $1 in November 2001. This meant the shareholders lost almost all of their money. Dynegy tried to buy Enron for a low price, but this didn't work so Enron went bankrupt on December 2, 2001 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. This was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at $63.4 billion in assets. This was not passed until the WorldCom scandal in 2002.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Accounting_scandal","surface_form":"accounting scandal","offset":25},{"uri":"Enron","surface_form":"Enron Corporation","offset":47},{"uri":"Bankruptcy","surface_form":"bankrupt","offset":132},{"uri":"Arthur_Andersen","surface_form":"Arthur Andersen","offset":203},{"uri":"Audit","surface_form":"audit","offset":261},{"uri":"Big_four_auditors","surface_form":"five largest","offset":321},{"uri":"Shareholder","surface_form":"shareholder","offset":435},{"uri":"Lawsuit","surface_form":"lawsuit","offset":456},{"uri":"Stock_market","surface_form":"stock price","offset":489},{"uri":"United_States_dollar","surface_form":"US$","offset":526},{"uri":"Dynegy","surface_form":"Dynegy","offset":629},{"uri":"Chapter_11","surface_form":"Chapter 11","offset":742},{"uri":"Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"United States Bankruptcy Code","offset":760},{"uri":"WorldCom_scandal","surface_form":"WorldCom scandal","offset":897}]}
