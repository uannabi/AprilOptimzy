{"id":80112,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waluigi","text":"Waluigi is a character in Nintendo's series of Mario video games. He is the villain version of Luigi in the same way that Wario is the evil version of Mario. Waluigi is a very long, thin, tall man, who wears purple. However, Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, and Yoshi are all friends.\nCharacteristics.\nWaluigi is very tall and thin. He wears black overalls with a purple shirt, and has brown, pointed shoes. He has upside-down Ls (\u0393s) on hat, gloves and mustache, and is the evil counterpart to Luigi.\nHe was made as a partner for Wario by the company Camelot in Mario Tennis and other Mario spinoff games and has no real story behind him. He is in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\", and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" as an Assist Trophy. Waluigi is known to be smarter than Wario, but acts sillier.\nReception.\nWaluigi was ranked in the tenth slot on GameDaily's top 10 Nintendo characters that deserve their own games. They also listed him as one of the top 25 video-game anti-heroes, saying that it was too bad that he has never had the spotlight.\nHowever, he also ranked number one on the Top 10 Worst \"Mario\" Characters list from Game Daily, which said, \"for every likable character there's one that continues to annoy us even years after we're done with the game they came from\". Waluigi has been criticised by others as well. Cracked.com said that he was a lazy excuse to add a new villain to the spin-off games and even called him an \"abomination\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"character","offset":13},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":26},{"uri":"Mario_(Nintendo)","surface_form":"Mario","offset":47},{"uri":"Video_games","surface_form":"video games","offset":53},{"uri":"Villain","surface_form":"villain","offset":76},{"uri":"Luigi","surface_form":"Luigi","offset":95},{"uri":"Wario","surface_form":"Wario","offset":122},{"uri":"Evil","surface_form":"evil","offset":135},{"uri":"Counterpart","surface_form":"counterpart","offset":477},{"uri":"Luigi","surface_form":"Luigi","offset":492},{"uri":"Wario","surface_form":"Wario","offset":528},{"uri":"Camelot","surface_form":"Camelot","offset":549},{"uri":"Mario_Tennis_and","surface_form":"Mario Tennis and","offset":560},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.
