Humboldt's work on botanical geography was very important in the field of biogeography.\nLife.\nHumboldt was born in Berlin. His father, Alexander Georg von Humboldt, was a major in the Prussian Army. He married Maria Elizabeth von Colomb in 1766. The couple had two sons, the younger was Alexander. Alexander's elder brother was the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt.\nIn his childhood Humboldt already liked to collect plants, shells, and insects. Humboldt's father died very early (in 1779). From that time on his mother took care of his education.\nBetween 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled to Latin America and was the first scientist who wrote about it. He was one of the first who said that South America and Africa was once one continent. Many places and species are named for him, as is the Humboldt Current.\nLate in his life he attempted to bring together different fields of science in his work \"Kosmos\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":24},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":78},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":87},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botanical","offset":131},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":141},{"uri":"Biogeography","surface_form":"biogeography","offset":186},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":227},{"uri":"Major","surface_form":"major","offset":283},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":296},{"uri":"Minister","surface_form":"minister","offset":453},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":463},{"uri":"Linguistics","surface_form":"linguist","offset":480},{"uri":"Wilhelm_von_Humboldt","surface_form":"Wilhelm von Humboldt","offset":489},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":738},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":876},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":903},{"uri":"Humboldt_Current","surface_form":"Humboldt Current","offset":940}]}
