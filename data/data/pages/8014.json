{"id":8014,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin","text":"Vlad\u00EDmir Vlad\u00EDmirovich Putin (,) is a Russian politician. He is currently President of Russia. Putin was born in Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, on 7 October 1952. He was the Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000, then President of Russia from March 2000 to May 2008, and Prime Minister again from 2008 to 2012. He became president again in 2012. He originally trained as a lawyer.\nEarly life.\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952, in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. His parents were Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911\u20131999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (\"n\u00E9e\" Shelomova; 1911\u20131998).\nEarly career.\nFrom 1985 to 1990, Putin worked for the KGB, the Soviet Union's secret spy service. Putin worked in Dresden, which was part of the former East Germany. After East Germany collapsed in 1989, Putin was told to come back to the Soviet Union. He chose to go to Leningrad, which is where he went to university. In June 1990, he started working in the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University. In June 1991, he was appointed head of the International Committee of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's office. His job was to promote international relations and foreign investments.\nPutin gave up his position in the KGB on August 20, 1991, during the putsch against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1994, he became First Deputy Chairman of the city of Saint Petersburg. In August 1996, he came to Moscow, and served in a variety of important positions in Boris Yeltsin's government. He was head of the FSB (a newer version of the KGB) from July 1998 to August 1999, and he was Secretary of the Security Council from March to August 1999.\nPresident of Russia.\nPutin became President of Russia in May 2000.\nPutin is the leader of the ruling United Russia party. This party has been winning the Russian elections ever since the fall of the Soviet Union.\nCritics of Putin say that he has taken away people's freedoms, and that he has failed to make the country more developed. Russia makes lots of money from selling oil and gas to other counties, but because of corruption, this money is not used for improving living conditions.\nRecently, the Russian opposition has held anti-government rallies, campaigned against Putin on the Internet, and published independent reports for general public. Because of censorship in the mass media, it's very difficult to get different information out to the public.\nPutin was against invading Libya in 2011. He is also against invading Syria and Iran.\nAccording to the Constitution of Russia, no-one can be president three times in a row. Because of this, Putin didn't put himself forward for the March 2008 election. However, you're allowed to be president as many times as you want, as long as it's not for more than two times in a row. In March 2012, Putin put himself forward for the elections, and won 64% of the vote. This means he will be president of Russia until 2018.\nIn December 6, 2017 Russia President Vladimir Putin announced he would run for a fourth term in the upcoming election, 2018 Russian Presidential Election.\nG8 suspension.\nOn March 24, 2014, Putin and Russia were suspended from the G8. This was because the United States thought that the Ukraine crisis was Putin's fault.\n2020 referendum.\nIn July 2020, Russian voters backed a referendum that would allow Putin to serve as president until 2036.\nPersonal life.\nHe is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and is divorced with two daughters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"President_of_Russia","surface_form":"President of Russia","offset":74},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg","offset":128},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Russia","surface_form":"Prime Minister of Russia","offset":176},{"uri":"President_of_Russia","surface_form":"President of Russia","offset":225},{"uri":"Lawyer","surface_form":"lawyer","offset":380},{"uri":"Leningrad","surface_form":"Leningrad","offset":437},{"uri":"Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","surface_form":"Russian SFSR","offset":448},{"uri":"Soviet_Union","surface_form":"Soviet Union","offset":462},{"uri":"Dresden","surface_form":"Dresden","offset":704},{"uri":"German_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"East Germany","offset":742},{"uri":"East_Germany","surface_form":"East Germany","offset":762},{"uri":"Saint_Petersburg","surface_form":"Saint Petersburg","offset":1085},{"uri":"Putsch","surface_form":"putsch","offset":1259},{"uri":"Mikhail_Gorbachev","surface_form":"Mikhail Gorbachev","offset":1291},{"uri":"Moscow","surface_form":"Moscow","offset":1411},{"uri":"Boris_Yeltsin","surface_form":"Boris Yeltsin","offset":1469},{"uri":"Federalnaya_Sluzhba_Bezopasnosti","surface_form":"FSB","offset":1516},{"uri":"President_of_Russia","surface_form":"President of Russia","offset":1686},{"uri":"United_Russia","surface_form":"United Russia","offset":1753},{"uri":"Corruption","surface_form":"corruption","offset":2073},{"uri":"Censorship","surface_form":"censorship","offset":2315},{"uri":"Constitution_of_Russia","surface_form":"Constitution of Russia","offset":2516},{"uri":"2018_Russian_Presidential_Election","surface_form":"2018 Russian Presidential Election","offset":3044},{"uri":"G8","surface_form":"G8","offset":3155},{"uri":"Euromaidan","surface_form":"Ukraine crisis","offset":3211},{"uri":"Referendum","surface_form":"referendum","offset":3300},{"uri":"Russian_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Russian Orthodox Church","offset":3405}]}
