{"id":801415,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)","text":"e=\"preserve\">In cricket, one team puts all of its players in the field and tries to stop the other team from scoring. These players in the field are called fielders, and they can get the other team's players out by hitting a wicket with the ball when the other team's players are not in the batsman's ground of the wicket.\nFielding positions.\nFielders can stand anywhere in the field, and there are many names for the different parts of the field they can stand in. Most of the names are based on what angle the fielder stands away from the batter (it also depends on whether the batter is left-handed or right-handed), and how far away they are from the batter.\nSome common fielding positions are the wicketkeeper and the bowler.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":16},{"uri":"Scoring_(cricket)","surface_form":"scoring","offset":109},{"uri":"Out_(cricket)","surface_form":"out","offset":208},{"uri":"Wicket","surface_form":"wicket","offset":225},{"uri":"Batsman%27s_ground","surface_form":"batsman's ground","offset":291},{"uri":"Wicketkeeper","surface_form":"wicketkeeper","offset":702},{"uri":"Bowler","surface_form":"bowler","offset":723}]}
