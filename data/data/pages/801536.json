The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the Olympic Games, first held in modern times in 1896 in Athens, Greece and inspired by the Ancient Olympic Games, one of a number of such events held in antiquity. Most modern multi-sports events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the\ncourse of several days in and around a \"host city\", which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports. Athletes or teams are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for first, second and third place respectively. Each games are generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sporting","offset":36},{"uri":"Nation_state","surface_form":"nation-states","offset":178},{"uri":"Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Olympic Games","offset":274},{"uri":"1896_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1896","offset":319},{"uri":"Ancient_Olympic_Games","surface_form":"Ancient Olympic Games","offset":362},{"uri":"Gold_medal","surface_form":"gold","offset":777},{"uri":"Silver_medal","surface_form":"silver","offset":783},{"uri":"Bronze_medal","surface_form":"bronze medal","offset":793}]}
