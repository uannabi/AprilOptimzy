{"id":8016,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England","text":"Henry VII or Henry Tudor (28 January 1457\u201321 April 1509) was King of England from 1485 to 1509. He founded the Tudor dynasty by winning the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. His son became king Henry VIII of England.\nBiography.\nHenry VII was born in 1457 to Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort. His father died two months before he was born, leaving his 13-year-old mother as his only parent. After Henry's birth, he spent a lot of time with his uncle Jasper Tudor. Jasper took Henry to France, where he spent most of his youth. Henry had a claim to the throne of England, but it was not a very good one, and he had to wait a long time for a chance to take the throne.\nIn 1483, a new king came to the throne in England, called Richard III. King Richard was not popular with everyone. Some thought he had stolen the throne from his young nephews and had killed them. This gave Henry the chance he had been waiting for. With help from the French, he raised an army. They landed at Dale in Pembrokeshire, close to where Henry had been born, so he was able to gather more supporters on the way.\nThe Wars of the Roses (1455\u20131485) had been going on for years. They were fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster and supporters of the House of York. Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house, tracing their descent from King Edward III.\nKing Henry VI and his family the House of Lancaster fought against their enemies for many years. The wars finally came to an end when King Henry VII of England came to the throne in 1485\nOn 22 August 1485, Henry's army defeated Richard III's army at the Battle of Bosworth Field. When Richard III died in this battle, Henry VII became king. Other people also had a claim on the throne, and Henry did his best to stop them from taking it from him, either by executing them, putting them in prison, or trying to make friends of them, as he did with the Earl of Lincoln. Another step he took was to marry Elizabeth of York, the niece of King Richard III, who would herself have been the heir to the throne if she had not been a girl.\nThere were also people who pretended to be long-lost members of the royal family, so that they could try to take the throne. One of these was a little boy called Lambert Simnel, who looked very like Edward, Earl of Warwick. The real Earl of Warwick was Henry's prisoner, but this did not stop other people from believing that Lambert was him. The Earl of Lincoln rebelled against King Henry and raised an army to make Lambert king, thinking that he himself could rule the country. There was a battle, and the Earl of Lincoln was killed. Lambert Simnel was captured, but, because he was only a child, Henry spared his life and he became a royal servant.\nHenry VII increased taxes so future kings would have enough money. People disliked that.\nDeath.\nHenry VII died in 1509 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his son, Henry VIII on 21 April 1509.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"King_of_England","surface_form":"King of England","offset":61},{"uri":"Tudor_dynasty","surface_form":"Tudor dynasty","offset":111},{"uri":"Battle_of_Bosworth_Field","surface_form":"battle of Bosworth Field","offset":140},{"uri":"Henry_VIII_of_England","surface_form":"Henry VIII of England","offset":194},{"uri":"Edmund_Tudor","surface_form":"Edmund Tudor","offset":258},{"uri":"Margaret_Beaufort","surface_form":"Margaret Beaufort","offset":275},{"uri":"Jasper_Tudor","surface_form":"Jasper Tudor","offset":451},{"uri":"Richard_III_of_England","surface_form":"Richard III","offset":726},{"uri":"Pembrokeshire","surface_form":"Pembrokeshire","offset":986},{"uri":"Wars_of_the_Roses","surface_form":"Wars of the Roses","offset":1094},{"uri":"Plantagenet","surface_form":"Plantagenet","offset":1312},{"uri":"Edward_III_of_England","surface_form":"King Edward III","offset":1364},{"uri":"Henry_VI_of_England","surface_form":"King Henry VI","offset":1381},{"uri":"Richard_III_of_England","surface_form":"Richard III","offset":1609},{"uri":"Battle_of_Bosworth_Field","surface_form":"Battle of Bosworth Field","offset":1635},{"uri":"Elizabeth_of_York","surface_form":"Elizabeth of York","offset":1983},{"uri":"Lambert_Simnel","surface_form":"Lambert Simnel","offset":2274},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster Abbey","offset":2902}]}
