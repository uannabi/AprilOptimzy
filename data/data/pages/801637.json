{"id":801637,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_poetry","text":"e=\"preserve\">Puerto Rican poetry refers to poems written by Puerto Rican authors.\nPuerto Ricans are American citizens. Thus, Puerto Rican poetry is considered part of American poetry because the island is a United States territory. Puerto Rican poetry is also considered part of Caribbean poetry and Latin American poetry due to the islands location in the Caribbean, and its cultural and linguistic ties to the region.\nPuerto Rican poetry is often written in Spanish. However, Puerto Rican poets also use English and Spanish within the same poem. Sometimes poets mix Spanish and English words into Spanglish expressions.\nThemes include: personal identity, cultural heritage, oppression, discrimination, racism, sexism, and Puerto Rican politics. Poems about the island often use images of oceans, rivers, beaches, local foods, and family traditions. However, Puerto Ricans poets who move to the mainland USA write about city streets, crowds, and the pressures of urban life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American_poetry","surface_form":"American poetry","offset":167},{"uri":"Caribbean_poetry","surface_form":"Caribbean poetry","offset":279},{"uri":"Latin_American_poetry","surface_form":"Latin American poetry","offset":300},{"uri":"Spanglish_(language)","surface_form":"Spanglish","offset":599},{"uri":"Oppression","surface_form":"oppression","offset":676},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":688},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racism","offset":704},{"uri":"Sexism","surface_form":"sexism","offset":712}]}
