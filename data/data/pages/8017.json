They were forced back by the Celts, who fiercely defended the coastline. It was not until 43 AD, under the rule of Emperor Claudius, that Roman forces landed on British soil at Richborough and took control of the land as far as the northern border. Dover, then called DVBRIS, became the Romans' most important naval town.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dover%2C_Delaware","surface_form":"capital of Delaware","offset":45},{"uri":"Town","surface_form":"town","offset":77},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":89},{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":98},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":111},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Romans","offset":147},{"uri":"Castle","surface_form":"castle","offset":166},{"uri":"Dover_Castle","surface_form":"Dover Castle","offset":190},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":232},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":245},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":284},{"uri":"Harbour","surface_form":"port","offset":318},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Britain","offset":326},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":377},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":389},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":415},{"uri":"Calais","surface_form":"Calais","offset":430},{"uri":"Strait_of_Dover","surface_form":"Strait of Dover","offset":451},{"uri":"English_Channel","surface_form":"English Channel","offset":500},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":534},{"uri":"Ostende","surface_form":"Ostende","offset":588},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":597},{"uri":"Vehicle","surface_form":"vehicle","offset":638},{"uri":"Tourism","surface_form":"tourist attractions","offset":698},{"uri":"White_Cliffs_of_Dover","surface_form":"White Cliffs of Dover","offset":739},{"uri":"Invasion","surface_form":"invade","offset":803},{"uri":"Julius_Caesar","surface_form":"Julius Caesar","offset":831},{"uri":"Celts","surface_form":"Celts","offset":875},{"uri":"Fierce","surface_form":"fiercely","offset":886},{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":908},{"uri":"List_of_Roman_emperors","surface_form":"Emperor","offset":961},{"uri":"Claudius","surface_form":"Claudius","offset":969},{"uri":"Richborough","surface_form":"Richborough","offset":1023},{"uri":"Navy","surface_form":"naval","offset":1156}]}
