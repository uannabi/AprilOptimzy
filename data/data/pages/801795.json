After school, he entered the Minsk State College of Architecture and Construction, and then the Belarusian State Academy of Arts, graduating from the Faculty of Design in 2012.\nIn 2014, he was conscripted into the Special Forces of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus (military unit 3214), and subsequently stayed in contact with his colleagues. Later, he worked as an administrator and then director of one of the retail stores of the \"Ostrov Chistoty\" in Minsk.\nCircumstances of his death.\nDuring the protests, the yard next to the house in which Raman lived became widely known as the \"Square of Changes)\". This name arose after residents of the residential complex in the quarter between Chervyakova, Kakhovskaya and Smorgovsky tract streets painted a mural with \"DJs of Change,\" two DJs who played the Russian pop song called \"Change\" at an event and were subsequently arrested, on one of the walls of a transformer booth. This mural was repeatedly destroyed, but then restored again by the local residents. The yard was often covered with red and white ribbons, symbolising the flag of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, which has become a symbol for the freedom movement in Belarus.\nOn November 11, 2020, at about 22:00, six men and three women in civilian clothes and in masks arrived at the \"Change Square\" and began to cut off the red and white ribbons placed by local residents. Raman Bandarenka found out about this in a local text chat in the popular app Telegram. He posted his final message in the group, \"I'm going out!\" before going out to the street to see what was happening.\nOutside, he stood watching what was happening. According to reports, he may have made a remark to which one of the masked people replied to him harshly before pushing Raman to the ground. At this time, Raman hit his head on a children's slide as he fell. The masked assailants proceeded to pin Raman to the ground and command him to \"Lie down!\" The main initiator of the fight left, and three others continued to beat him.\nFollowing the assault, Raman was dragged off to a silver minibus. This is the last known time he was seen conscious. The events of this evening were filmed by eyewitnesses from different angles and then posted on the net.\nHe was taken to the Central District Department of Internal Affairs (Police Station), from which he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the Minsk City Clinical Emergency Hospital on November 12 at 0:05. He was diagnosed with multiple injuries. He underwent an operation in an attempt to save his life. Raman Bandarenka died on November 12, 2020.\nAs of January, 14, 2021, no criminal case was opened on his killing.\nSuspects and independent investigation.\nOn November 16, 2020 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia imposed a travel ban against the kickboxer Dmitry Shakuta and the president of the Belarusian hockey federation Dzmitry Baskau \u2018for an unspecified period\u2019 because of their alleged involvement in the killing of Raman Bandarenka. A number of sportspeople have previously identified them in photos and videos of the masked persons who attacked Bandarenka. Baskau and Shakuta did not comment on the suspicions. In the same month Estonia also imposed a travel ban against Shakuta and Baskau. In January 2020 the International Ice Hockey Federation declared that it opened an independent investigation concerning the involvement of Dzmitry Baskau in this incident.\nPublic reaction.\nOn the evening of November 12, several thousand Belarusians came to the \u201CSquare of Change\u201D to pay tribute to Raman Bandarenka.

At the conference, he said that he instructed the chairman of the Investigative Committee to investigate the incident and instructed the Prosecutor General to take it under \"the most serious control.\" Lukashenko told reporters: \"But in this case, as I was told, a fight broke out, moreover, a serious fight. And someone from the protesters called the \"police.\" A reinforced police squad was sent. When they arrived, as usual, everyone fled. And this one was either injured or something... inebriated. This is a fact. The conclusion was presented today by the Investigative Committee. They posted it all. He was drunk. Of course, he was taken and taken by this department. He felt ill on the way, as I was told. They called an ambulance and sent him to the hospital.\"\nOther reactions.\nChairman of the Council of the Republic Natalya Kochanova stated: \"Now there is a radicalization [of the protests]....This is the case with this Bondarenko. He himself went out [into the yard]. The fact that he was drunk is one hundred percent fact. Now there is an investigation, and have already established that false information was put on the Internet, that he was sober (we are talking about information and documents from the doctors of the emergency room.). But the investigation will go further. But did you see how he [Bondarenko] was honored? A memorial! And how many drunks [in the whole country] are fighting? Every day they die. And they [the protesters] are arranging memorial services. The President said it right: we need to clean up the city!\"\nAs of November 27, 2020, no criminal case has been instituted on Bandarenka's death, while TUT.BY journalist Katsyaryna Barysevich and doctor Artsyom Sorokin, who reported medical information that the murdered man was completely sober, refuting the words of Alexander Lukashenko and Natalya Kochanova that Bandarenka was drunk, had been detained in connection with the criminal case upon them. Amnesty International has recognized the journalist and doctor as prisoners of conscience. Belarusian human rights organizations have recognized Borisevich as a political prisoner. Boris Haretski, deputy chairman of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, said that the authorities were not fighting the problem, but the media, \u201CThey think that if the press does not write about Bandarenka, people will not find out about it. Of course, they will know everything, but the media is still under attack.\"\nThe chairman of the human rights center \"Viasna\" Ales Bialiatski accused the death of Roman Bondarenko of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus.\nIn a statement dated 13 November 2020, the EU condemned the brutality.
