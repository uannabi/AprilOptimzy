{"id":801888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_80_(software_platform)","text":"Series 80 (formerly \"Crystal\") is a mobile software platform introduced in 2000 that uses Symbian. It was made by Nokia for their enterprise and professional level smartphones. All devices that use it have a screen resolution of 640\u00D7200 pixels and a full QWERTY keyboard. The large size of the screens are used to good effect, but software has to be developed specifically for it and the market for it was relatively small.\nThe last Series 80 device is the Nokia 9300i, announced in 2005 and shipped in 2006. The last Communicator, the Nokia E90 Communicator, released in 2007, uses S60 3rd Edition instead of Series 80.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Symbian","surface_form":"Symbian","offset":90},{"uri":"QWERTY","surface_form":"QWERTY","offset":255},{"uri":"Nokia_9300i","surface_form":"Nokia 9300i","offset":457},{"uri":"Nokia_E90_Communicator","surface_form":"Nokia E90 Communicator","offset":536},{"uri":"S60_(software_platform)","surface_form":"S60 3rd Edition","offset":583}]}
