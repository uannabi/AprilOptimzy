{"id":80201,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frauenfeld","text":"Frauenfeld is the capital city of the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland. It is also the capital city of the district of Frauenfeld.\nEarly history.\nThe city is first written about in 1246. It grew up around the Frauenfeld castle on the land of the Reichenau convent.\nIn 1264, it became the property of the Habsburgs. In 1374, the Habsburgs bestowed the right of judgment for all of Thurgau (which then included St. Gallen) on the Duke of Frauenfeld.\nTwice in the 1700s, Frauenfeld was partly destroyed by fire, in 1771 and in 1788.\nThe fall of the old Old Swiss Confederacy in 1798 as a result of the French invasion brought an end to the gatherings in Frauenfeld.\nModern history.\nIn 1919, the municipalities of Langdorf, Kurzdorf, Huben, Herten, and Horgenbach became part of Frauenfeld. In 1998, Gerlikon, Sch\u00F6nenhof, and Zelgli joined Frauenfeld.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":18},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":38},{"uri":"Thurgau","surface_form":"Thurgau","offset":48},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":59},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":87},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":107},{"uri":"Frauenfeld_(district)","surface_form":"Frauenfeld","offset":119},{"uri":"1246","surface_form":"1246","offset":181},{"uri":"Reichenau","surface_form":"Reichenau","offset":246},{"uri":"1264","surface_form":"1264","offset":268},{"uri":"Habsburg","surface_form":"Habsburg","offset":304},{"uri":"1374","surface_form":"1374","offset":318},{"uri":"St._Gallen","surface_form":"St. Gallen","offset":409},{"uri":"1700s","surface_form":"1700s","offset":461},{"uri":"1771","surface_form":"1771","offset":512},{"uri":"1788","surface_form":"1788","offset":524},{"uri":"Old_Swiss_Confederacy","surface_form":"Old Swiss Confederacy","offset":550},{"uri":"1798","surface_form":"1798","offset":575},{"uri":"1919","surface_form":"1919","offset":682},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":692},{"uri":"Langdorf","surface_form":"Langdorf","offset":710},{"uri":"Kurzdorf","surface_form":"Kurzdorf","offset":720},{"uri":"Huben","surface_form":"Huben","offset":730},{"uri":"Herten","surface_form":"Herten","offset":737},{"uri":"Horgenbach","surface_form":"Horgenbach","offset":749},{"uri":"1998","surface_form":"1998","offset":790},{"uri":"Gerlikon","surface_form":"Gerlikon","offset":796},{"uri":"Sch%C3%B6nenhof","surface_form":"Sch\u00F6nenhof","offset":806},{"uri":"Zelgli","surface_form":"Zelgli","offset":822}]}
