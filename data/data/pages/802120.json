It belongs to the Maghrebi Arabic language continuum and is partially mutually intelligible with Tunisian and Moroccan.\nLike other varieties of Maghrebi Arabic, Algerian has a mostly Semitic vocabulary. It contains Berber and Latin (African Romance) influences and has numerous loanwords from French, Andalusian Arabic, Ottoman Turkish and Spanish.\nAlgerian Arabic is the native dialect of 75% to 80% of Algerians and is mastered by 85% to 100% of them. It is a spoken language used in daily communication and entertainment, while Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is generally reserved for official use and education.\nStandard positional numeral systems.\nThe common names are derived somewhat arbitrarily from a mix of Latin and Greek, in some cases including roots from both languages within a single name. There have been some proposals for standardisation.\nNon-positional notation.\nAll known numeral systems developed before the Babylonian numerals are non-positional, as are many developed later, such as the Roman numerals. The French Cistercian monks created their own numeral system.\nHistory.\nImmediately after conquering Ry\u016Bky\u016B, Satsuma conducted a land survey in Okinawa in 1609 and in Yaeyama in 1611. By doing so, Satsuma decided the amount of tribute to be paid annually by Ry\u016Bky\u016B. Following that, Ry\u016Bky\u016B imposed a poll tax on Yaeyama in 1640. A fixed quota was allocated to each island and then was broken up into each community. Finally, quotas were set for the individual islanders, adjusted only by age and gender. Community leaders were notified of quotas in the government office on Ishigaki. They checked the calculation using \"warazan\" (\"barazan\" in Yaeyama), a straw-based method of calculation and recording numerals that was reminiscent of Incan Quipu. After that, the quota for each household was written on a wooden plate called. That was where Kaid\u0101 glyphs were used. Although \"s\u014Dr\u014D\"-style Written Japanese had the status of administrative language, the remote islands had to rely on pictograms to notify illiterate peasants. According to a 19th-century document cited by the \"Yaeyama rekishi\" (1954), an official named \u014Chama Seiki designed \"perfect ideographs\" for \"itafuda\" in the early 19th century although it suggests the existence of earlier, \"imperfect\" ideographs. Sud\u014D (1944) recorded an oral history on Yonaguni: 9 generations ago, an ancestor of the Kedagusuku lineage named Mase taught Kaid\u0101 glyphs and \"warazan\" to the public. Sud\u014D dated the event to the second half of the 17th century.\nAccording to Ikema (1959), Kaid\u0101 glyphs and \"warazan\" were evidently accurate enough to make corrections to official announcements. The poll tax was finally abolished in 1903. They were used until the introduction of the nationwide primary education system rapidly lowered the illiteracy rate during the Meiji period. They are currently used on Yonaguni and Taketomi for folk art, T-shirts, and other products, more for their artistic value than as a record-keeping system.\nBy type of notation.\nThe common names are derived somewhat arbitrarily from a mix of Latin and Greek, in some cases including roots from both languages within a single name.
