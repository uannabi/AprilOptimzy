{"id":802123,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alutor_Numerals","text":"Algerian Arabic (known as Darja in Algeria) is a dialect derived from the form of Arabic spoken in northern Algeria. It belongs to the Maghrebi Arabic language continuum and is partially mutually intelligible with Tunisian and Moroccan.\nLike other varieties of Maghrebi Arabic, Algerian has a mostly Semitic vocabulary. It contains Berber and Latin (African Romance) influences and has numerous loanwords from French, Andalusian Arabic, Ottoman Turkish and Spanish.\nAlgerian Arabic is the native dialect of 75% to 80% of Algerians and is mastered by 85% to 100% of them. It is a spoken language used in daily communication and entertainment, while Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is generally reserved for official use and education.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["language"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Maghrebi_Arabic","surface_form":"Darja","offset":26},{"uri":"Variety_(linguistics)","surface_form":"form","offset":74},{"uri":"Arabic","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":82},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":108},{"uri":"Maghrebi_Arabic","surface_form":"Maghrebi Arabic","offset":135},{"uri":"Language_continuum","surface_form":"language continuum","offset":151},{"uri":"Tunisian_Arabic","surface_form":"Tunisian","offset":214},{"uri":"Moroccan_Arabic","surface_form":"Moroccan","offset":227},{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic","offset":300},{"uri":"Berber_languages","surface_form":"Berber","offset":332},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":343},{"uri":"African_Romance","surface_form":"African Romance","offset":350},{"uri":"Loanword","surface_form":"loanword","offset":395},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":410},{"uri":"Andalusian_Arabic","surface_form":"Andalusian Arabic","offset":418},{"uri":"Ottoman_Turkish_language","surface_form":"Ottoman Turkish","offset":437},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":457},{"uri":"Native_language","surface_form":"native dialect","offset":489},{"uri":"Modern_Standard_Arabic","surface_form":"Modern Standard Arabic","offset":648}]}
