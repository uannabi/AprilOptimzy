{"id":80228,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinfelden","text":"Weinfelden is a municipality in the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland. It is the capital of the district of the same name.\nIn December 2004 it had about 9500 people. Since it is in the middle of the canton, part of the canton's government is in the town. The Thurgau cantonal bank is also there. The grand council of the canton meets in Weinfelden during the winter.\nEarly history.\nAlready in the year 124 AD, there was a Roman bridge over the Thur at Weinfelden. The name \"Weinfelden\" is first documented in 838.\nWeinfelden was by far the biggest town in the canton of Thurgau. In 1798, Paul Reinhart and his committee led the area to freedom from the domination of the \"Eidgenossen\". In 1803, Thurgau became an independent canton, through the mediation of Napoleon, with Frauenfeld as capital.\nModern history.\nIn 1830, Thomas Bornhauser spoke to a large crowd in Weinfelden, demanding a liberal constitution for the canton. It is one of the first (if not the first) such document.\nPortraits of both Paul Reinhart and Thomas Bornhauser hang in the \"Rathaus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":16},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":36},{"uri":"Thurgau","surface_form":"Thurgau","offset":46},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":57},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":95},{"uri":"Ancient_Rome","surface_form":"Roman","offset":421},{"uri":"Thur","surface_form":"Thur","offset":443},{"uri":"1798","surface_form":"1798","offset":581},{"uri":"Paul_Reinhart_(Swiss_politician)","surface_form":"Paul Reinhart","offset":587},{"uri":"Eidgenosse","surface_form":"Eidgenosse","offset":671},{"uri":"1803","surface_form":"1803","offset":688},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":757},{"uri":"Frauenfeld","surface_form":"Frauenfeld","offset":772},{"uri":"1830","surface_form":"1830","offset":814},{"uri":"Thomas_Bornhauser","surface_form":"Thomas Bornhauser","offset":820}]}
