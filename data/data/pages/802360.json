{"id":802360,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_wicket_cricket","text":"=\"preserve\">Single wicket cricket is a form of cricket which is mainly played between two opponents, the batter and bowler.\nRules.\nThe main feature of single wicket cricket is that the batter had to run from his ground at the striker's end to the bowling crease at the bowler's end and back to score a run. This is different from regular cricket, in which a batter only needs to run between the two batsmens' grounds, and means that one run can only be scored when the batter runs 124 feet (37.7 meters), rather than 58 feet (17.6 meters).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cricket","surface_form":"cricket","offset":47},{"uri":"Batsman%27s_ground","surface_form":"ground","offset":212},{"uri":"Striker%27s_end","surface_form":"striker's end","offset":226},{"uri":"Bowling_crease","surface_form":"bowling crease","offset":247},{"uri":"Bowler%27s_end","surface_form":"bowler's end","offset":269},{"uri":"Batsmens%27_grounds","surface_form":"batsmens' grounds","offset":399}]}
