{"id":802366,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_coconut","text":"A falling coconut that hits a person can cause injury to their back, neck, shoulders, and head. It could even kill a person.\nA 1984 study on \"Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts\" made people exaggerate statements about how many people died by falling coconuts. An urban legend says that falling coconuts kill a few people every year. This became more known in 2002 when an expert in shark attacks says that falling coconuts kill 150 people every year around the world. This statement is often compared to the number of deaths that are caused by a shark (which is around 5 deaths every year). Reports of death by coconuts have happened in the 1770s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coconut","surface_form":"coconut","offset":10},{"uri":"Injury","surface_form":"injury","offset":47},{"uri":"Neck","surface_form":"neck","offset":69},{"uri":"Shoulder","surface_form":"shoulder","offset":75},{"uri":"Study","surface_form":"study","offset":132},{"uri":"Due_to","surface_form":"Due to","offset":151},{"uri":"Exaggerate","surface_form":"exaggerate","offset":188},{"uri":"Urban_legend","surface_form":"urban legend","offset":261},{"uri":"Expert","surface_form":"expert","offset":370},{"uri":"Shark_attack","surface_form":"shark attack","offset":380},{"uri":"World","surface_form":"world","offset":459},{"uri":"Often","surface_form":"often","offset":484},{"uri":"Shark","surface_form":"shark","offset":544}]}
