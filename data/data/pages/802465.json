{"id":802465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Act","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Quebec Act was a British law passed in 1774. It was about Quebec in Canada.\nBritain ruled Quebec after the French and Indian War. Before that, it had been ruled by France. Most of the white people in Quebec spoke the French language and used the Roman Catholic part of the Christian religion instead of the Church of England part of the Christian religion.\nThe British Parliament passed the Quebec Act in 1774. It said that French Canadians did not need to say a loyalty oath any more. It gave Roman Catholics more rights. It let the French Canadians use some French laws instead of only British laws.\nThis made many British settlers in Canada angry because they did not like Roman Catholics. They called the Quebec Act an Intolerable Act.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":75},{"uri":"French_and_Indian_War","surface_form":"French and Indian War","offset":124},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French language","offset":234},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic","surface_form":"Roman Catholic","offset":263},{"uri":"Church_of_England","surface_form":"Church of England","offset":324},{"uri":"Loyalty_oath","surface_form":"loyalty oath","offset":480},{"uri":"Roman_Catholics","surface_form":"Roman Catholics","offset":511},{"uri":"Intolerable_Act","surface_form":"Intolerable Act","offset":740}]}
