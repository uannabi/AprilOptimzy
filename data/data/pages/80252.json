{"id":80252,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiviuq_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Kiviuq is a non-spherical moon of Saturn. It was found by Brett J. Gladman in 2000, and given the designation S/2000\u00A0S\u00A05.\nIt was named in 2003 after a \"giant\" of Inuit mythology. Kiviuq (also spelled Keeveeok, Qiviuq or Kivioq) is a legendary and heroic Inuk, a sort of Inuit Odysseus. He has lived very long (or has had several lives), has wandered and journeyed, living all sorts of adventures whose details depend on the story-teller's local tradition.\nKiviuq is about 16 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 11.1 million kilometers in 450 days. It is a member of the Inuit group of non-spherical moons.\nKiviuq displays \"light-red\" colours and the infrared spectrum very similar to Siarnaq and Paaliaq, further supporting the thesis of a possible common origin of the Inuit group in the break-up of a bigger body.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":29},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":47},{"uri":"Brett_J._Gladman","surface_form":"Brett J.
