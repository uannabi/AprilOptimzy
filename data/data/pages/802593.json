{"id":802593,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterminism","text":"e=\"preserve\">In computer science, a nondeterministic algorithm is an algorithm that does not give the same result each time it is used.\nEven for the same input, it may show different behaviors on different runs. This may be contrasted with a deterministic algorithm.\nThe projection of an automaton almost always results in nondeterminism.\nExhibiting nondeterminism; involving choices between indistinguishable possibilities.\nBeing nondeterministic; involving arbitrary choices; necessitating the choice between various indistinguishable possibilities.\nDependence on factors other than initial state and input.\nMoving from a single-processor to a multi-processor system often exposes hidden nondeterminism due to invalid assumptions about scheduling.\nThere are several ways an algorithm may behave differently from run to run. Referring to the inability to objectively predict an outcome or result of a process due to lack of knowledge of a cause and effect relationship or the inability to know initial conditions.\nNon-predictive. Referring to the inability to objectively predict an outcome or result of a process due to lack of knowledge of a cause and effect relationship or the inability to know initial conditions.\nIn telecommunications switching and routing, the unpredictability of a path between nodes.
