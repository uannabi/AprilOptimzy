{"id":802622,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Americans","text":"Swiss Americans are Americans of Swiss descent. Swiss emigration to America predates the formation of the United States, often as the result of the persecution of Anabaptism during the Swiss Reformation and the formation of the Amish community. In the 19th century, there was lots of immigration of Swiss farmers, who preferred rural settlements in the Midwest.\nSwiss immigration slowed down after 1930, although limited immigration continues. The number of Americans of Swiss descent is nearly one million. The Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs reported the permanent residency of Swiss people in the United States as 80,218 in 2015.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"Americans","offset":20},{"uri":"Swiss_people","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":33},{"uri":"Anabaptism","surface_form":"Anabaptism","offset":163},{"uri":"Swiss_Reformation","surface_form":"Swiss Reformation","offset":185},{"uri":"Amish","surface_form":"Amish","offset":228},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":252},{"uri":"Farmer","surface_form":"farmer","offset":305},{"uri":"Midwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Midwest","offset":353},{"uri":"Federal_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs","surface_form":"Federal Department of Foreign Affairs","offset":518}]}
