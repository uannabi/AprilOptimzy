It was found by Brett Gladman,Kavelaars, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000\u00A0S\u00A08.\nSkathi is about 6.4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 15,576,000\u00A0km in 725.784 days, at an inclination of 149\u00B0 to the ecliptic (150\u00B0 to Saturn's equator) with an eccentricity of 0.246.\nSkathi may have been formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe by big impacts at some point in the solar system's history.\nIts name comes from Norse mythology, where Ska\u00F0i is a giantess (female giant) who is the wife of the Vanir god Njord.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":41},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":49},{"uri":"Brett_Gladman","surface_form":"Brett Gladman","offset":73},{"uri":"John_J._Kavelaars","surface_form":"Kavelaars","offset":87},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":277},{"uri":"Ecliptic","surface_form":"ecliptic","offset":304},{"uri":"Eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":348},{"uri":"Debris","surface_form":"debris","offset":404},{"uri":"Phoebe_(moon)","surface_form":"Phoebe","offset":426},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":513},{"uri":"Ska%C3%B0i","surface_form":"Ska\u00F0i","offset":536},{"uri":"Giantess","surface_form":"giantess","offset":547},{"uri":"Vanir","surface_form":"Vanir","offset":594},{"uri":"Njord","surface_form":"Njord","offset":604}]}
