{"id":802724,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETC_(Philippine_TV_Channel)","text":"ETC (stylized as) is a commercial broadcasting television network in the Philippines owned by the Southern Broadcasting Network subsidiary of Solar Entertainment Corporation. Its digital free-to-air broadcast is carried by SBN's flagship station, DWCP-DTV (channel 21) in Metro Manila. The channel's analog broadcast is fed on its lone provincial TV station, DXSS-TV (channel 7) in Davao City. The channel is also carried by cable and satellite providers, including Sky Cable, Destiny Cable, Cablelink, Sky Direct, G Sat, Cignal and SatLite, along with various provincial cable operators and through online streaming.\nETC operates 24 hours daily (including the annual Paschal Triduum) on Solar's digital free TV (under test broadcast) as well as on most pay TV and streaming service providers. It formerly operated daily from 5:00\u00A0a.m. to 1:00\u00A0a.m. on free-to-air analog TV broadcast until September 2019, when SBN permanently closed its analog signal.\nETC broadcasts from Solar's master control facility and studios located at the Third Floor of the Worldwide Corporate Center, Epifanio de los Santos corner Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City, while SBN's sales office is located at the 22/F Strata 2000 Bldg., F. Ortigas Jr., Road, Ortigas Center, Pasig City. SBN holds free-to-air broadcasts from its transmitter and tower site located at Nuestra Se\u00F1ora de la Paz Subdivision, Bo. Sta. Cruz, Antipolo, Rizal.\nHistory.\nOn January 1, 2004, ETC was launched on various cable and satellite providers as \"Entertainment Central\".\nOn January 1, 2008, ETC ceased to air over Sky Cable as a separate channel. As part of the Solar network's block-time agreements with various terrestrial channels, ETC started airing over SBN 21, a terrestrial UHF TV station in the Philippines.\nOn March 2, 2011, ETC had moved to RPN after the network was privatized, while Talk TV, a news-oriented channel airing local and US news programs, launched on SBN 21.\nHowever, ETC returned to SBN on November 30, 2013, as Solar News Channel moved to RPN the following day to allow SNC's wider coverage. (SNC and RPN, however, were sold to ALC Group of Companies chair, Ambassador Antonio Cabangon Chua, in August the following year, due to the Tieng's loss of revenue after investing on RPN.)\nAfter its sister channel 2nd Avenue ended broadcasting on June 5, 2018 after 12 years of broadcasts, many of its programs moved to this channel.\nOn November 21, 2018, ETC unveiled its new station ID and on-air graphics. At the same time, the network also launched their new slogans, \"In Full Bloom\" and \"#IamETC\".\nProgramming.\nMainly targeting the young adult demographics, ETC's programming currently consists of sitcoms, drama series, reality and entertainment news programs from the U.S. The network also produces and/or airs local programming, including news programs, lifestyle, infotainment and entertainment programs \"Etcetera\" and reality programs \"Project Runway Philippines\", \"I Am Meg\" and \"Mega Fashion Crew\", the latter of which is produced by the One Mega Group and TV 100 Production.\nRatings.\nAccording to National Urban Television Audience Measurement, ETC is the top-ranked female television channel with cable and free TV ratings combined (January 2012 - May 2012) with a 10.33% audience share.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television channel"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Commercial_broadcasting","surface_form":"commercial broadcasting","offset":23},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"television network","offset":47},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":73},{"uri":"Southern_Broadcasting_Network","surface_form":"Southern Broadcasting Network","offset":98},{"uri":"Solar_Entertainment_Corporation","surface_form":"Solar Entertainment Corporation","offset":142},{"uri":"DWCP-DTV","surface_form":"DWCP-DTV","offset":247},{"uri":"Metro_Manila","surface_form":"Metro Manila","offset":272},{"uri":"DXSS-TV","surface_form":"DXSS-TV","offset":359},{"uri":"Davao_City","surface_form":"Davao City","offset":382},{"uri":"Sky_Cable","surface_form":"Sky Cable","offset":466},{"uri":"Destiny_Cable","surface_form":"Destiny Cable","offset":477},{"uri":"Cablelink","surface_form":"Cablelink","offset":492},{"uri":"Sky_Direct","surface_form":"Sky Direct","offset":503},{"uri":"G_Sat","surface_form":"G Sat","offset":515},{"uri":"Cignal","surface_form":"Cignal","offset":522},{"uri":"EDSA_(road)","surface_form":"Epifanio de los Santos","offset":1079},{"uri":"Shaw_Boulevard","surface_form":"Shaw Boulevard","offset":1109},{"uri":"Mandaluyong","surface_form":"Mandaluyong City","offset":1125},{"uri":"Ortigas_Center","surface_form":"Ortigas Center","offset":1232},{"uri":"Pasig_City","surface_form":"Pasig City","offset":1248},{"uri":"Antipolo","surface_form":"Antipolo","offset":1393},{"uri":"Rizal","surface_form":"Rizal","offset":1403},{"uri":"Sky_Cable","surface_form":"Sky Cable","offset":1568},{"uri":"Southern_Broadcasting_Network","surface_form":"SBN 21","offset":1713},{"uri":"Ultra_high_frequency","surface_form":"UHF","offset":1735},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"TV","offset":1739},{"uri":"Radio_Philippines_Network","surface_form":"RPN","offset":1805},{"uri":"Talk_TV_(Philippines)","surface_form":"Talk TV","offset":1849},{"uri":"Solar_News_Channel","surface_form":"Solar News Channel","offset":1991},{"uri":"Antonio_Cabangon_Chua","surface_form":"Antonio Cabangon Chua","offset":2149},{"uri":"2nd_Avenue_(television_channel)","surface_form":"2nd Avenue","offset":2287},{"uri":"Sitcom","surface_form":"sitcom","offset":2676},{"uri":"Drama_(film_and_television)","surface_form":"drama series","offset":2685},{"uri":"Reality_television","surface_form":"reality","offset":2699},{"uri":"Entertainment","surface_form":"entertainment","offset":2711},{"uri":"News","surface_form":"news","offset":2725},{"uri":"Etcetera_(TV_program)","surface_form":"Etcetera","offset":2887},{"uri":"Project_Runway_Philippines","surface_form":"Project Runway Philippines","offset":2919},{"uri":"One_Mega_Group","surface_form":"One Mega Group","offset":3023},{"uri":"AGB_Nielsen_Philippines","surface_form":"National Urban Television Audience Measurement","offset":3083}]}
