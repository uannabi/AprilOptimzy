{"id":802725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWCP-DTV","text":"DWCP-DTV (digital UHF and virtual channel 21) is a television station owned by Southern Broadcasting Network, a subsidiary of Solar Entertainment Corporation, and is currently the flagship station of Philippine television network, ETC. Its studios are located at the Third Floor Worldwide Corporate Center, Shaw Boulevard corner EDSA, Mandaluyong City, with transmitter facilities located at the Solar Entertainment Complex, along Nuestra Se\u00F1ora de la Paz Subdivision, Barangay Sta. Cruz, Antipolo, Rizal. SBN-21 became the first local UHF TV station in Metro Manila that broadcast in May 1992 and formerly known as World TV 21. It operates 24 hours daily.\nAs of September 12, 2019, the station's analog signal is permanently off the air.\nHistory.\nSouthern Broadcasting Network of Davao launched SBN Channel 21, the first local UHF TV station in Metro Manila since 1992. It was then known as World TV 21 by Kampana Television Corporation, which provided programming content from ABC, CNN and ESPN on this channel then. The idea is to bring back programming similar to the forcibly shut-down FEN Channel 17 of the former Clark US Air Base a year earlier due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.\nBeginning on January 1, 2008, Solar Entertainment began to lease airtime on SBN, choosing to broadcast programming from its entertainment channel ETC. This partnership ended on March 2, 2011, as Solar transferred ETC to RPN. As a result, SBN renewed partnership with Solar Entertainment to create the news network Talk TV. On October 30, 2012, the channel was renamed as the Solar News Channel.\nOn December 1, 2013, SNC's programming was moved to RPN for wider national coverage, with ETC returned to SBN a day before.\nIn 2015, SBN ceased using its old analog transmitter tower at Strata 2000 building in Pasig City (which was obvious to consider even after Solar's purchase of SBN due to the old Sign-on and Sign-off sequences) and began using Solar's newly constructed tower located in Antipolo for a clearer and better signal reception in both the analog and digital signals.\nAs of September 12, 2019, SBN closed down its analog signal.\nDigital television.\nSBN launches its digital television broadcast in 2015. Solar Entertainment supplies its DTV channels through the new platform. For unknown reasons, the transmitter's encryption system was activated throughout its run, making two of the station's subchannels receivable only on set-top boxes with this capability. The technical issue was fixed by September 25, 2017.\nDigital channels.\nDWCP-TV operates on UHF Channel 21 (515.143\u00A0MHz).\nIn addition, Solar operates its secondary channel via DZBC-TV on UHF Channel 30 (569.143\u00A0MHz) under a subchannel lease agreement from its frequency owner Byers Communications.\nAnalog-to-digital transition.\nOn September 12, 2019, SBN closed down UHF Channel 21's analog signal in preparation of the DTV transition implementation. SBN is the 5th television network in the Philippines to permanently terminate its analog TV broadcasts, and go digital only.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["television station"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Television_station","surface_form":"television station","offset":51},{"uri":"Southern_Broadcasting_Network","surface_form":"Southern Broadcasting Network","offset":79},{"uri":"Solar_Entertainment_Corporation","surface_form":"Solar Entertainment Corporation","offset":126},{"uri":"Flagship_(television)","surface_form":"flagship station","offset":180},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippine","offset":200},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"television network","offset":211},{"uri":"ETC_(Philippine_TV_Channel)","surface_form":"ETC","offset":231},{"uri":"Shaw_Boulevard","surface_form":"Shaw Boulevard","offset":307},{"uri":"Mandaluyong_City","surface_form":"Mandaluyong City","offset":335},{"uri":"Antipolo","surface_form":"Antipolo","offset":489},{"uri":"Rizal","surface_form":"Rizal","offset":499},{"uri":"UHF","surface_form":"UHF","offset":536},{"uri":"Davao_City","surface_form":"Davao","offset":781},{"uri":"Metro_Manila","surface_form":"Metro Manila","offset":846},{"uri":"Far_East_Network","surface_form":"FEN Channel 17","offset":1091},{"uri":"Solar_Entertainment_Corporation","surface_form":"Solar Entertainment","offset":1220},{"uri":"ETC_(Philippine_TV_channel)","surface_form":"ETC","offset":1336},{"uri":"Radio_Philippines_Network","surface_form":"RPN","offset":1410},{"uri":"Talk_TV_(Philippines)","surface_form":"Talk TV","offset":1504},{"uri":"Solar_News_Channel","surface_form":"Solar News Channel","offset":1565},{"uri":"Pasig","surface_form":"Pasig City","offset":1795}]}
