{"id":802859,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSEPR_theory","text":"=\"preserve\">The shape of a molecule or ion is determined by the repulsion between the electron pairs surrounding the central atom.\n- Only the electron pairs arranged round the central atom in a covalent molecule need to be considered\n- Pairs of electrons repel each other and move as far apart as possible\n- Lone pair-lone pair repulsion is greater than lone pair-bonding pair repulsion which is greater than bonding pair- bonding pair repulsion\n- The actual shape of species is determined by the \"atoms\" attached round the central atom (and influenced by the lone pairs of electrons)\n- All bonds - single bonds, double bonds and triple bonds - take up the same space.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
