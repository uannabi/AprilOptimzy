{"id":80288,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albiorix_(moon)","text":"Albiorix is a non-spherical moon of Saturn. It was found by Holman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000\u00A0S\u00A011.\nAlbiorix is the biggest member of the Gallic group of non-spherical moons.\nIt was named in August 2003 from one of the Celtic names for the god of tribal unity, better known as Toutatis.\nAlbiorix orbits Saturn at a distance of about 16,000,000 km and its diameter is estimated at 32 kilometers, assuming an albedo of 0.04. A day on Albiorix is 13 hours and 19 minutes long.\nThe diagram illustrates its orbit in relation to other prograde non-spherical moons of Saturn. The eccentricity of the orbits is represented by the yellow segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre.\nDifferent colours seen recently suggest a possibility of a big crater, suggesting that Erriapo and Tarvos could be pieces of Albiorix following a near break-up collision with another body.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":18},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":36},{"uri":"Matthew_J._Holman","surface_form":"Holman","offset":60},{"uri":"Saturn%27s_Gallic_group_of_satellites","surface_form":"Gallic group","offset":161},{"uri":"Celtic_mythology","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":242},{"uri":"Toutatis","surface_form":"Toutatis","offset":300},{"uri":"Albedo","surface_form":"albedo","offset":430},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":565},{"uri":"Apsis","surface_form":"pericentre","offset":680},{"uri":"Apsis","surface_form":"apocentre","offset":698},{"uri":"Crater","surface_form":"crater","offset":772},{"uri":"Erriapo_(moon)","surface_form":"Erriapo","offset":796},{"uri":"Tarvos_(moon)","surface_form":"Tarvos","offset":808}]}
