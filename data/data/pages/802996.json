{"id":802996,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taih%C5%8D_Code","text":"The Taih\u014D Code was a group of laws in Japan. It was the law during the 700s c.e., which was the Nara period in Japan. Here, \"code\" means \"set of rules.\"\nThe Taih\u014D Code had two kinds of laws. It had \"ritsu\" which were laws about crime and how to arrest people. It had \"ry\u014D\", which were laws about how to run the government. For example, the ry\u014D said which areas were provinces and who would run them and what things the governors were and were not allowed to do.\nThe lawmakers who wrote the Taih\u014D Code copied things from Chinese laws. This was the Tang Dynasty in China. But the Japanese lawmakers wrote the Taih\u014D Code to give more government jobs to Japanese noblemen. This was different from the Tang Dynasty laws, which said anyone from any family could work for the government if they took and passed the right tests.\nModern scholars do not have a copy of the entire Taih\u014D Code, but they think it is about the same as the later Y\u014Dr\u014D Code.\nIf the Taih\u014D Code and the Y\u014Dr\u014D Code count as the same thing, then they lasted from 702 c.e. until the start of the Tokugawa period in 1232 c.e.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nara_period","surface_form":"Nara period","offset":96},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":228},{"uri":"Tang_Dynasty","surface_form":"Tang Dynasty","offset":547},{"uri":"Tokugawa_shogunate","surface_form":"Tokugawa","offset":1057}]}
