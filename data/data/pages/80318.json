{"id":80318,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertosaurus","text":"\"Albertosaurus\" was a relative of \"Tyrannosaurus\". \"Albertosaurus\" was smaller than \"T. rex\" and lived a few million years earlier. \"Albertosaurus\" walked on two legs and had a large head with sharp, saw-toothed teeth. It had two-fingered hands on short arms. Its long tail provided balance and quick turning. It had powerful back legs with clawed, three-toed feet.\nIt was about 30 feet (9 m) long, about 11 feet (3.4 m) tall at the hips, and up to 3 tons in weight (averaging roughly 2500 kg). The lower jaw of \"Albertosaurus\" had from 14 and 16 teeth; the upper jaw had 17-19 teeth. It had one row of teeth in each jaw but had at least one replacement tooth growing up from under each tooth.\n\"Albertosaurus\" was more lightly built than \"Tyrannosaurus\", and therefore probably a faster mover in open spaces.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus","offset":35},{"uri":"Teeth","surface_form":"teeth","offset":212},{"uri":"Arm","surface_form":"arm","offset":254},{"uri":"Jaw","surface_form":"jaw","offset":505},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus","offset":739}]}
