Later he made discoveries about infrared radiation and the physical properties of the air. In 1859 he proved the connection between atmospheric CO and what is now known as the greenhouse effect.\nTyndall also published more than a dozen science books which brought state-of-the-art 19th century experimental physics to a wide audience. From 1853 to 1887 he was professor of physics at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in London.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","surface_form":"FRS","offset":13},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":80},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":86},{"uri":"Diamagnetism","surface_form":"diamagnetism","offset":108},{"uri":"Infrared_radiation","surface_form":"infrared radiation","offset":154},{"uri":"Greenhouse_effect","surface_form":"greenhouse effect","offset":298},{"uri":"Experiment","surface_form":"experiment","offset":416},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":429},{"uri":"Royal_Institution_of_Great_Britain","surface_form":"Royal Institution of Great Britain","offset":510},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":548}]}
