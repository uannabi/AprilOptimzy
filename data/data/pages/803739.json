There is a dark stripe down each side of its body with white on the edges of the stripe. Adult male frogs have a dark-colored vocal sac on their throats and females do not.\nThis frog lives in river valleys with many trees, but it also lives in gardens, parks, and places where humans grow fruit trees. It hides in the plants during the day and looks for food at night and in the evening. Because this frog can jump a long way, flying insects are a great part of its food.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tree_frog","surface_form":"tree frog","offset":108},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":123},{"uri":"Crete","surface_form":"Crete","offset":157},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":167},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":211},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":222},{"uri":"Orchard","surface_form":"places where humans grow fruit trees","offset":738}]}
