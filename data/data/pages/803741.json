{"id":803741,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_Incorrect","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Politically Incorrect\" is an American late-night, half-hour political talk show hosted by Bill Maher that aired from 1993 to 2002. It premiered on Comedy Central in 1993, before moving to ABC in January 1997. On September 17, 2001, Bill Maher criticized United States foreign policy on the show and argued that the perpetrators of the September 11 terrorist attacks were not cowards. The comments were widely condemned, and while Maher later apologized, major advertisers stopped advertising with the show. The show was canceled in 2002.\nThe show first originated from New York City, but soon moved to Los Angeles. The New York episodes were shot at the CBS Broadcast Center and the Los Angeles episodes at CBS Television City, where it remained even after its move to ABC.\nThe first episode featured comedian Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern co-host Robin Quivers, Republican Party strategist Ed Rollins, and comedian Larry Miller. Frequent guests included Dave Matthews, Arianna Huffington, Michael McKean, Ann Coulter, Carrot Top, and Christine O'Donnell.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Talk_show","surface_form":"talk show","offset":84},{"uri":"Bill_Maher","surface_form":"Bill Maher","offset":104},{"uri":"Comedy_Central","surface_form":"Comedy Central","offset":161},{"uri":"American_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"ABC","offset":202},{"uri":"United_States_foreign_policies","surface_form":"United States foreign policy","offset":268},{"uri":"September_11_terrorist_attacks","surface_form":"September 11 terrorist attacks","offset":349},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":583},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":616},{"uri":"CBS_Broadcast_Center","surface_form":"CBS Broadcast Center","offset":668},{"uri":"CBS_Television_City","surface_form":"CBS Television City","offset":721},{"uri":"Jerry_Seinfeld","surface_form":"Jerry Seinfeld","offset":824},{"uri":"Howard_Stern","surface_form":"Howard Stern","offset":840},{"uri":"Robin_Quivers","surface_form":"Robin Quivers","offset":861},{"uri":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Republican Party","offset":876},{"uri":"Ed_Rollins","surface_form":"Ed Rollins","offset":904},{"uri":"Larry_Miller_(entertainer)","surface_form":"Larry Miller","offset":929},{"uri":"Dave_Matthews","surface_form":"Dave Matthews","offset":968},{"uri":"Arianna_Huffington","surface_form":"Arianna Huffington","offset":983},{"uri":"Michael_McKean","surface_form":"Michael McKean","offset":1003},{"uri":"Ann_Coulter","surface_form":"Ann Coulter","offset":1019},{"uri":"Carrot_Top","surface_form":"Carrot Top","offset":1032},{"uri":"Christine_O%27Donnell","surface_form":"Christine O'Donnell","offset":1048}]}
