{"id":80384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundilfari_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Mundilfari or Saturn\u00A0XXV, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by Brett J. Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000\u00A0S\u00A09.\nMundilfari is about 5.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 18,360,000\u00A0km in 928.806 days, at an inclination of 170\u00B0 to the ecliptic (150\u00B0 to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.198.\nMundilfari may have formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe by big impacts at some point in the solar system's history.\nIt was named in August 2003 from Norse mythology, where Mundilfari is a Jotun or giant who is the father of the goddess Sol and the god Mani.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":44},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":52},{"uri":"Brett_J._Gladman","surface_form":"Brett J.
