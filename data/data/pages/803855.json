The cut \u2013 and the scars it leaves \u2013 form an extension of what resembles a smile. Sometimes further to hurt or even kill the victim, he or she would then be stabbed or kicked, most notably in the stomach (or in case of kicking, the groin), so that the face would be ripped apart when the victim screamed. Mutilation of this kind is commonly inflicted with a utility knife.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"370x370px","surface_form":"Glasgow Smile","offset":237}]}
