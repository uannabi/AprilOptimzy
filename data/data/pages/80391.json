{"id":80391,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergelmir_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Bergelmir or Saturn XXXVIII (provisional designation S/2004 S 15) is a moon of Saturn. Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Jan Kleyna, and Brian G. Marsden on May 4, 2005, from observations taken between December 12, 2004, and March 9, 2005.\nBergelmir is about 6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,372,000\u00A0km in 1006.659 days, at an inclination of 157\u00B0 to the ecliptic (134\u00B0 to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.152.\nIt was named in April 2007 after Bergelmir, a giant from Norse mythology and the grandson of Ymir, the primordial giant. Bergelmir and his wife alone among their kind were the only survivors of the enormous deluge of blood from Ymir's wounds when he was killed by Odin and his brothers at the dawn of time. Bergelmir then became the progenitor of a new race of giants.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":84},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":92},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
