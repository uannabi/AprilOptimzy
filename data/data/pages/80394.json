{"id":80394,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narvi_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Narvi () or Saturn\u00A0XXXI is a moon of Saturn. It was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and given the designation S/2003\u00A0S\u00A01.\nDescription.\nNarvi is about 7\u00A0kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,371,000\u00A0km in 1006.541\u00A0days, at an inclination of 137\u00B0 to the ecliptic (109\u00B0 to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.320.\nNaming.\nIt was named in January 2005 after Narvi from Norse mythology, also known as Narfi or Nari, a son of Loki by Sigyn who was killed to punish Loki for his crimes. The gods turned his brother V\u00E1li into a slavering wolf who tore his throat out. His entrails were used to bind Loki to a stone slab for all eternity, or at least until Ragnarok. The name was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on January 21, 2005.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":42},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":50},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
