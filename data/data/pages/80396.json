{"id":80396,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suttungr_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Suttungr or Saturn\u00A0XXIII, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by Brett J. Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000\u00A0S\u00A012.\nSuttungr is about 5.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,667,000\u00A0km in 1029.703 days, at an inclination of 174\u00B0 to the ecliptic (151\u00B0 to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.131.\nSuttungr may have formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe at some point in the past.\nIt was named in August 2003 from Norse mythology, where Suttung is a Jotun or giant who once owned the mead of poetry.\nThe name was said as Suttung in [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/08100/08177.html IAU Circular 8177]. However, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature later decided to add the nominative case ending \"-r\" to the base form \"Suttung\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":44},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":52},{"uri":"Brett_J._Gladman","surface_form":"Brett J.
