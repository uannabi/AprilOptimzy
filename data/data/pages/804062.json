It was written and published during the 1848 revolution, initially with the name \"Un r\u0103sunet\" (). It was first sung in late June in the same year in the city of Bra\u0219ov, on the streets of the \u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului neighborhood. It was immediately accepted as the revolutionary anthem and renamed \"De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00E2ne!\"\nSince then, this song, which contains a message of liberty and patriotism, has been sung during all major Romanian conflicts, including during the 1989 anti-communist revolution. After the revolution, it became the national anthem on 24 January 1990, replacing the communist-era national anthem \"Trei culori\" ().\nJuly 29 is now the \"National Anthem Day\" \"(Ziua Imnului na\u021Bional)\", an annual observance in Romania.\nThe song was also used on various solemn occasions in the Moldavian Democratic Republic during its brief existence between 1917 and 1918. Furthemore, between 1991 and 1994, \"De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00E2ne!\" also was the national anthem of Moldova, but it was subsequently replaced by the current Moldovan anthem, \"Limba noastr\u0103\" ().","categories":[],"infobox_types":["anthem"],"annotations":[{"uri":"National_anthem","surface_form":"national anthem","offset":130},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":149},{"uri":"Andrei_Mure%C8%99anu","surface_form":"Andrei Mure\u0219anu","offset":186},{"uri":"Wallachian_Revolution_of_1848","surface_form":"1848 revolution","offset":352},{"uri":"Bra%C8%99ov","surface_form":"Bra\u0219ov","offset":473},{"uri":"%C8%98cheii_Bra%C8%99ovului","surface_form":"\u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului","offset":503},{"uri":"Romanian_Revolution_of_1989","surface_form":"1989 anti-communist revolution","offset":774},{"uri":"Trei_culori","surface_form":"Trei culori","offset":923},{"uri":"Holidays_in_Romania","surface_form":"observance in Romania","offset":1018},{"uri":"Moldavian_Democratic_Republic","surface_form":"Moldavian Democratic Republic","offset":1099},{"uri":"Moldova","surface_form":"Moldova","offset":1270},{"uri":"Limba_noastr%C4%83","surface_form":"Limba noastr\u0103","offset":1345}]}
