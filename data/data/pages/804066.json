{"id":804066,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_alphabet","text":"The letters Q (\"chiu\"), W (\"dublu v\"), and Y (\"igrec\" or \"i grec\") were formally introduced in the Romanian alphabet in 1982, although they had been used earlier. They occur only in foreign words and their Romanian derivatives, such as \"quasar\", \"watt\", and \"yacht\". The letter \"K\", although relatively older, is also rarely used and appears only in proper names and international neologisms such as \"kilogram\", \"broker\", \"karate\". These four letters are still perceived as foreign, which explains their usage for stylistic purposes in words such as \"nomenklatur\u0103\" (normally \"nomenclatur\u0103\", meaning \"nomenclature\", but sometimes spelled with \"k\" instead of \"c\" if referring to members of the Communist leadership in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries, as \"Nomenklatura\" is used in English).\nIn cases where the word is a direct borrowing having diacritical marks not present in the above alphabet, official spelling tends to favor their use (\"M\u00FCnchen\", \"Angoul\u00EAme\" etc., as opposed to the use of \"Istanbul\" over \"\u0130stanbul\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Quasar","surface_form":"quasar","offset":237},{"uri":"Watt","surface_form":"watt","offset":247},{"uri":"Yacht","surface_form":"yacht","offset":259},{"uri":"Nomenklatura","surface_form":"Nomenklatura","offset":769},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnchen","surface_form":"M\u00FCnchen","offset":955},{"uri":"Angoul%C3%AAme","surface_form":"Angoul\u00EAme","offset":966},{"uri":"Istanbul","surface_form":"Istanbul","offset":1009}]}
