{"id":804067,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-comma","text":"S-comma (majuscule: \u0218, minuscule: \u0219) is a letter which is part of the Romanian alphabet, used to represent the sound, the voiceless postalveolar fricative (like \"sh\" in \"shoe\").\nHistory.\nThe letter was proposed in the \"Buda Lexicon\", a book published in 1825, which included two texts by Petru Maior, \"Orthographia romana sive latino-valachica una cum clavi\" and \"Dialogu pentru inceputul linbei rom\u00E2ne\", introducing \u0219 for and \u021B for.\nUnicode support.\nS-comma was not initially supported in early Unicode versions, nor in the predecessors like IEC 8859-2 and Windows-1250. Instead, \u015E (S-cedilla), a character available since Unicode 1.1.0 (1993), was used for digital texts written in Romanian. In some contexts, like with low-resolution screens and printouts, the visual distinction between \"\u0219\" and \"\u015F\" is minimal. In 1999, at the request of the Romanian Standardization Association, S-comma was introduced in Unicode 3.0. Nevertheless, encoding for the S-comma was not supported in retail versions of Microsoft Windows XP, but a later [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ec6f335-c3de-44c5-a13d-a1e7cea5ddea&DisplayLang=en European Union Expansion Font Update] provided the feature. While digital accessibility to S-comma has since improved, both characters continue to be used interchangeably in various contexts like publishing.\nThe letter is part of Unicode's Latin Extended-B range, under \"Additions for Romanian\", titled as \"Latin capital letter S with comma below\" (U+0218) and \"Latin small letter s with comma below\" (U+0219). In HTML, these can be encoded by codice_2 and codice_2, respectively.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Romanian_alphabet","surface_form":"Romanian alphabet","offset":70},{"uri":"Voiceless_postalveolar_fricative","surface_form":"voiceless postalveolar fricative","offset":122},{"uri":"Petru_Maior","surface_form":"Petru Maior","offset":288},{"uri":"Unicode","surface_form":"Unicode","offset":496},{"uri":"IEC_8859-2","surface_form":"IEC 8859-2","offset":543},{"uri":"Windows-1250","surface_form":"Windows-1250","offset":558},{"uri":"%C5%9E","surface_form":"\u015E","offset":581},{"uri":"S","surface_form":"S","offset":584},{"uri":"Cedilla","surface_form":"cedilla","offset":586},{"uri":"Asociatia_de_Standardizare_din_Rom%C3%A2nia","surface_form":"Romanian Standardization Association","offset":846},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":1002},{"uri":"Windows_XP","surface_form":"Windows XP","offset":1012},{"uri":"Publishing","surface_form":"publishing","offset":1342},{"uri":"HyperText_Markup_Language","surface_form":"HTML","offset":1560}]}
