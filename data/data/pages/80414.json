{"id":80414,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrymr_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Thrymr or Saturn\u00A0XXX, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000\u00A0S\u00A07.\nThrymr is about 5.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 20,810,000\u00A0km in 1120.809 days, at an inclination of 175\u00B0 to the ecliptic (151\u00B0 to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.453.\nThrymr may have formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe at some point in the past.\nIts name comes from Norse mythology, where Thrymr is a Jotun or frost giant.\nThe name was said as Thrym in [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/08100/08177.html IAU Circular 8177]. However, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature later decided to add the nominative case ending \"-r\" to the root \"Thrym\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":40},{"uri":"Saturn_(planet)","surface_form":"Saturn","offset":48},{"uri":"Brett_J._Gladman","surface_form":"Gladman","offset":72},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":261},{"uri":"Ecliptic","surface_form":"ecliptic","offset":288},{"uri":"Eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":333},{"uri":"Debris","surface_form":"debris","offset":384},{"uri":"Phoebe_(moon)","surface_form":"Phoebe","offset":406},{"uri":"Norse_mythology","surface_form":"Norse mythology","offset":460},{"uri":"Thrymr","surface_form":"Thrymr","offset":483},{"uri":"Jotun","surface_form":"Jotun","offset":495},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"IAU","offset":630},{"uri":"Working_Group_on_Planetary_System_Nomenclature","surface_form":"Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature","offset":634},{"uri":"Nominative_case","surface_form":"nominative case","offset":706}]}
