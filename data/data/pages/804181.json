{"id":804181,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Nine_Angles","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Order of Nine Angles (also called ONA or O9A) is a Satanic group based in the United Kingdom. The group say that the organization was created in the 1960s. The organisation became popular in the 1980s, because of its Neo-Nazi beliefs.\nThe ONA believe that human history can be broken up into nine aeons - groups of time each representing a human civilization. They want to create a government based on Satanism, Fascism and Social Darwinism, which is the idea that both people and countries succeed because they are naturally better than other people or countries. (Social Darwinism has been proven to be wrong.) Some parts of the ONA say people should rape women and children. According to the BBC, pedophiles have joined the ONA.\nThe government of the United Kingdom says one part of the ONA, the Sonnenkrieg Division, is a terrorist organization. The Sonnenkrieg Division is now illegal in the United Kingdom.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satanism","surface_form":"Satanic","offset":68},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":95},{"uri":"Neo-Nazism","surface_form":"Neo-Nazi","offset":234},{"uri":"Eon","surface_form":"aeon","offset":314},{"uri":"Civilization","surface_form":"civilization","offset":363},{"uri":"Social_Darwinism","surface_form":"Social Darwinism","offset":441},{"uri":"Rape","surface_form":"rape","offset":670}]}
