First resources of library were the collections of John III Sobieski. Later, this collection was confiscated by Russian troops and placed in Imperial Public Library.\nWhen Poland regained her independence in 1918, there was no central institution to serve in the capacity of a national library. Recreation of National Library of Poland was made on 24 February 1928, by the decree of president Ignacy Mo\u015Bcicki. It was opened in 1930 and initially had 200 thousand volumes. Its first Director General was Stefan Demby. In 1934, the Director has been changed. Stefan Vrtel-Wierczy\u0144ski became the new Director.\nCollections.\nToday the collections of the National Library are one of the largest in the country.
