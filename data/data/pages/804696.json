{"id":804696,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj","text":"e=\"preserve\">Purna Swaraj, or \"total independence,\" was a document written by the Indian National Congress session at Lahore in December 19, 1929. It said that India should be separate from the British Empire. Purna Swaraj was announced on January 26, 1930. This is one reason why January 26 is India's Republic Day.\nThe Purna Swaraj was 750 words long. Scholars such as Mithi Mukherjee say it was an important part of Indian independence because it said becoming independent was about justice.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":194},{"uri":"Republic_Day","surface_form":"Republic Day","offset":303}]}
