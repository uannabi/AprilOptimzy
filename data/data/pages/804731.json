It lives in parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Portugal, Spain, France and Italy where there is plenty of water in the air.\nThe female frog lays eggs on groups of plants near the edge of a body of water. The tadpoles hatch after eight to ten days. The very largest tadpoles grow to 5.5 cm long. They become frogs after three or four months. The frogs eat insects and insect-like animals, for example spiders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":79},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":89},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":100},{"uri":"Morocco","surface_form":"Morocco","offset":129},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":138},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":147},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":156},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":166},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":173},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":184},{"uri":"Humidity","surface_form":"water in the air","offset":215},{"uri":"Arthropoda","surface_form":"insect-like animals","offset":476}]}
