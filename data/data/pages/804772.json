{"id":804772,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_grinder","text":"An angle grinder is a handheld power tool. It is also known as a disc grinder or side grinder. They are commonly used in machine shops and metal workshops. Most angle grinders today are powered by electricity. They can be corded or battery-powered. Angle grinders can be used for cutting, grinding, and polishing objects.\nThere are different kinds of discs that are used for various materials and tasks. Angle grinders can use grinding stones, sanding discs, wire brush wheels, cut-off discs, abrasive grinding discs, and polishing pads. Angle grinders come in different disc sizes and motor specifications. Other differences include a power source, rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is measured in imperial or metric units. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy-duty jobs.\nAngle grinders generate sparks when cutting ferrous metals. The blades on the angle grinder may also break during operation. Proper personal protective equipment must always be worn when using an angle grinder. Angle grinders should never be used without their guard or handle attached. Inspect the discs for cracks, defects, and wear before using an angle grinder.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"RPM","surface_form":"rpm","offset":650},{"uri":"Ferrous","surface_form":"ferrous","offset":979}]}
