{"id":804773,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboard_core_material","text":"Core Material Function.\nThe core material of the snowboard must withstand 3 types of loading: transverse loading, longitudinal loading, and torsional loading. Transverse loading is applied on the middle of longitudinal axis and the edge of the board. Longitudinal loading is applied on the middle of the rear binding of the board. Torsional loading is applied in the middle where the front section of the board will twist towards the opposite direction of the rear section.\nCore Material Selection Objective.\nThe objectives of a snowboard core is to minimize mass and cost of production. Mass affects the performance of a snowboard, as it is easier to reach higher speed. Cost is minimized to lower expenditure and increase sales.\nConstraints.\nThe constraints on a snowboard core are width, length, and fracture toughness. Width is constrained to 240mm to 260 mm. Length is constrained to 1000mm to 1600mm. Fracture toughness must be above 0.7 MPa*m^(1/2) so that the snowboard does not break easily.\nCommon Core Materials.\nSome common core materials include wood, Kevlar, and aluminum. Wood is used in the core as a sandwich-like structure. Kevlar is resistant to heat and have tightly knitted fibers. Aluminum is used in a honeycomb like a bee's nest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Snowboard","surface_form":"snowboard","offset":49}]}
