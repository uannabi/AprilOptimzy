{"id":804778,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis","text":"Demosthenes \"Demis\" Hassabis (born 27 July 1976) is a significant figure in artificial intelligence. He is a British researcher, neuroscientist, video game designer, entrepreneur, and five times winner of the Pentamind board games championship.\nHassabis is the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, a machine learning AI startup, founded in London in 2010 with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. Hassabis met Legg when both were postdocs at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, and he and Suleyman had been friends through family. Hassabis also recruited his university friend and Elixir partner David Silver.\nDeepMind's mission is to \"solve intelligence\" and then use intelligence \"to solve everything else\". More concretely, DeepMind aims to use powerful general-purpose learning algorithms to build an artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nThe company was bought by Google for \u00A3400 million.\nThey created AlphaGo, a program which defeated world champion Lee Sedol at the complex game of Go. Go had been considered a holy grail of AI, for its high number of possible board positions and resistance to existing programming techniques. However, AlphaGo beat European champion Fan Hui 5-0 in October 2015 before winning 4-1 against former world champion Lee Sedol in March 2016.\nMore recently, DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein-folding, one of the toughest problems in science. In December 2018, DeepMind's tool AlphaFold won the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins.\nAlthough Hassabis is expert at many games, he does not program specific rules into Deep Mind. For Go and chess, the machine played many games with itself, learning from its results. In other words it taught itself how to play, given the basic rules of the game.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Artificial_intelligence","surface_form":"artificial intelligence","offset":76},{"uri":"Neuroscientist","surface_form":"neuroscientist","offset":129},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":145},{"uri":"DeepMind","surface_form":"DeepMind","offset":283},{"uri":"Shane_Legg","surface_form":"Shane Legg","offset":355},{"uri":"Mustafa_Suleyman","surface_form":"Mustafa Suleyman","offset":370},{"uri":"Postdoctoral_researcher","surface_form":"postdocs","offset":421},{"uri":"University_College_London","surface_form":"University College London","offset":433},{"uri":"Algorithms","surface_form":"algorithms","offset":805},{"uri":"Artificial_general_intelligence","surface_form":"artificial general intelligence","offset":828},{"uri":"Google","surface_form":"Google","offset":893},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":909},{"uri":"AlphaGo","surface_form":"AlphaGo","offset":931},{"uri":"Lee_Sedol","surface_form":"Lee Sedol","offset":980},{"uri":"Go_(game)","surface_form":"Go","offset":1013},{"uri":"Fan_Hui","surface_form":"Fan Hui","offset":1199},{"uri":"Lee_Sedol","surface_form":"Lee Sedol","offset":1276},{"uri":"Protein","surface_form":"protein","offset":1363}]}
