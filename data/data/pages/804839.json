{"id":804839,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_vivant","text":"A tableau vivant is when people pose and make the scene look like the one in a picture. In general, people in a tableau vivant don't move. They are also silent. The name comes from French, and translates to \"living picture\". The plural is tableaux vivants. The people may also be lit like in the theatre, to better resemble the picture. In Europe, tableaux vivants became popular towards the end of the 18th century. Sometimes, there was even music. Jean Sibelius composed his work \"Finlandia\" (1900) for a sequence of tableaux vivants.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, they became notorious, because usually naked women would present them in revue theatres. The dancer Olga Desmond became well-known because of her posing naked in revues at the beginning of the 20th century.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":79},{"uri":"Jean_Sibelius","surface_form":"Jean Sibelius","offset":450},{"uri":"Olga_Desmond","surface_form":"Olga Desmond","offset":675}]}
