{"id":80487,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leberk%C3%A4se","text":"is a meat specialty. Other names include \"Leberk\u00E4s\", \"Leberka(a)s\"and Fleischk\u00E4se. It originally was from the South of Germany. It can also be found in Austria and Switzerland. It is similar to meatloaf. It is made of corned beef, sometimes pork, bacon and onions. The ingredients are ground until they are very fine. They are then packed together into loaves. These are baked in an oven, until they get a brown crust.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Leberk\u00E4se\" literally translates to \"liver-cheese\". In Bavaria there is neither cheese nor liver in the dish, though. Some linguists say, that the word may be related to the German word \"Laib\" (loaf). Perhaps it also contains the Slavic root \"quas\" (yeast).\nWhat can be in Leberk\u00E4se.\nAccording to German food laws, only products called \"Bavarian Leberk\u00E4se\" are allowed not to have liver in them; otherwise, there must be a minimum liver content of 4%. Some local variants must contain even more liver; for example, the liver content of \"Stuttgarter Leberk\u00E4se\" must be at least 5%.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":5},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":119},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":152},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":164},{"uri":"Meatloaf","surface_form":"meatloaf","offset":194},{"uri":"Corned_beef","surface_form":"corned beef","offset":218},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":241},{"uri":"Bacon","surface_form":"bacon","offset":247},{"uri":"Onion","surface_form":"onion","offset":257},{"uri":"Loaf","surface_form":"loaves","offset":353},{"uri":"Cheese","surface_form":"cheese","offset":519},{"uri":"Liver","surface_form":"liver","offset":530},{"uri":"Linguist","surface_form":"linguist","offset":562},{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic","offset":669},{"uri":"Stuttgart","surface_form":"Stuttgart","offset":976}]}
