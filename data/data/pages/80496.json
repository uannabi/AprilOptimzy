{"id":80496,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophelia_(moon)","text":"Ophelia is a closer moon of Uranus. It was found from the images taken by \"Voyager 2\" on January 20, 1986, and was given the designation S/1986\u00A0U\u00A08. It was not seen until the Hubble Space Telescope saw it in 2003.\nOphelia was named after the daughter of Polonius, Ophelia, in William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\". It is also designated Uranus\u00A0VII.\nUnfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 23\u00A0km and geometric albedo of 0.08, almost nothing is known about it. At the Voyager 2 images Ophelia appears as a streched object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":28},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":75},{"uri":"January_20","surface_form":"January 20","offset":89},{"uri":"1986","surface_form":"1986","offset":101},{"uri":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"Hubble Space Telescope","offset":175},{"uri":"2003","surface_form":"2003","offset":208},{"uri":"Polonius","surface_form":"Polonius","offset":254},{"uri":"Ophelia","surface_form":"Ophelia","offset":264},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":276},{"uri":"Hamlet","surface_form":"Hamlet","offset":304},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":471},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":558}]}
