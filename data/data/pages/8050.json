{"id":8050,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics","text":"Marvel Comics (founded in 1939 as Marvel Worldwide Inc., then Marvel Publishing, Inc. and later Marvel Comics Group) is an American comic book company that makes \"superhero\" comic books. Its top rival is DC Comics. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company bought Marvel for US$4 billion. Its comic book characters were created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others.\nIt is responsible for iconic and well-known characters such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, War Machine, Iron Fist, Deadpool, Thor, Wolverine, Hercules, the Hulk, She-Hulk, Hawkeye, Falcon, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Ms. Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man, the Wasp, Ghost Rider, Black Panther, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Howard the Duck, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Nick Fury, Silver Surfer, the Punisher, Blade, Daredevil, Elektra, and Vision.\nMost of the characters take place in the fictional Marvel Universe (MU) with locations that either mirror real-life cities or are fictional places and its fictional teams include the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the Guardians of the Galaxy, S.H.I.E.L.D., the Sinister Six, and the X-Men.\nIt is also famous for fictional villains such as Green Goblin, Doctor Doom, Doctor Octopus, Ultron, Venom, Thanos, the Sandman, Galactus, Enchantress, Black Cat, Loki, Shocker, Mephisto, Morbius, Blackheart, the Lizard, Blackout, Electro, Vengeance, Mysterio, Annihilus, Vulture, Kang the Conqueror, Scorpion, Abomination, Mister Negative, Magneto, Hobgoblin, Red Hulk, Rhino, Barracuda, Kingpin, Jigsaw, Kraven the Hunter, Copperhead, Chameleon, Red Skull, Tinkerer, the Mandarin, Tombstone, MODOK, Jackal, Bullseye, Prowler, Dormammu, Mystique, and Apocalypse.\nHistory.\nMarvel used to be a company called Timely Comics in the 1940s and then Atlas Comics in the 1950s. The first comic published with the name \"Marvel Comics\" was \"The Fantastic Four\" #1 in November, 1961. The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. In order to capitalize on the growing popularity of comic books\u2014especially those starring superheroes\u2014Goodman created Timely Comics. Timely\u2019s first comic book was \"Marvel Comics\" no. 1 (cover dated October 1939), which featured several superhero characters, most notably the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero characters during comics\u2019 \u201CGolden Age\u201D in the 1940s, most importantly Captain America, who first appeared in \"Captain America Comics\" no. 1 (March 1941). Timely characters were often portrayed as fighting against the Nazis and the Japanese even before the United States entered World War II. As the 1940s came to a close, superheroes fell out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely canceled the last of its books in this genre in 1950. In 1951, Goodman formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas Magazines. Though there was a brief experiment in bringing back superheroes such as Captain America in 1953, Atlas\u2019s output was mostly in other genres such as humour, westerns, horror, war, and science fiction.\nIn 1956, rival company DC Comics ushered in the so-called Silver Age of comics by reintroducing superhero titles with significant commercial success. In the early 1960s Atlas changed its name to Marvel Comics. For several decades Marvel and DC were the top companies in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and \u201990s Marvel changed hands numerous times, becoming a publicly held company in 1991. Questionable management decisions and a general slump in sales in the comic book industry drove Marvel Comics into bankruptcy in 1996. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 1998 and began to diversify its output, launching imprints aimed at a variety of demographics and expanding its cinematic offerings under the Marvel Studios banner. In 2007 Marvel began publishing digital comics. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company purchased the parent company of Marvel Comics.\nThe Marvel Universe.\nThe shared storytelling palette known as the Marvel universe was unveiled in 1961, when Goodman responded to the growing interest in superhero books by commissioning writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby to create the Fantastic Four. With the release of \"Fantastic Four\" no. 1 (November 1961), readers were introduced to a superheroic setting that was, nevertheless, rooted in the real world. Lee and Kirby attempted to make their comic book characters more original by allowing them to interact with each other in a realistic fashion, including heroes often fighting or arguing with each other. This trend continued with a flood of other superhero characters introduced by Marvel Comics during the early 1960s, including Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, and the X-Men. Lee wrote the majority of Marvel\u2019s books during that time, and Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko were the most important and influential artists.\nThis more realistic approach to characterizations built up Marvel\u2019s reputation and began to attract university-age readers. Stories also began to deal with social issues such as pollution, race relations, and drug abuse. A Spider-Man story arc from 1971 dealing with drug abuse had to be published without the approval of the Comic Code Authority\u2014the self-regulatory body that had policed comic content since 1954\u2014despite the fact that it was portraying drug use in a negative light. This caused the Comic Code Authority to revise its policy in such matters.\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s saw a new generation of creative talent emerge at Marvel. In 1967 Jim Steranko began to write and draw stories featuring secret agent Nick Fury in the anthology book \"Strange Tales\". Steranko was influenced in his work by James Bond films and the psychedelic and Op art movements, and the resulting stories melded groundbreaking visuals with equally innovative storytelling techniques. Writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne began a long collaboration on \"The Uncanny X-Men\" in 1975. The pair revitalized the flagging series with characters such as Wolverine and complex story arcs that soon made the X-Men franchise one of Marvel\u2019s best sellers.\nIn 1985, Mark Gruenwald started a critically acclaimed 10-year run as the writer of \"Captain America\". That same year he also began the miniseries \"Squadron Supreme\" (1985\u201386), a deconstructionist take on superheroes that preceded Alan Moore\u2019s graphic novel \"Watchmen\", published by DC Comics. The 1980s also saw Frank Miller\u2019s stint on \"Daredevil\", which took that book in a darker and grittier direction, reviving sagging sales and making it one of Marvel\u2019s best sellers. In 1988, Todd MacFarlane began a popular run as artist on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Four years later MacFarlane and a number of other popular artists, including Jim Lee, Erik Larsen, and Rob Liefeld, left Marvel to found rival Image Comics, a company that allowed creators to retain the copyrights of their characters.\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, a new wave of writers, including Brian Michael Bendis (\"Daredevil\", \"The Avengers\"), Jonathan Hickman (\"Fantastic Four\"), and Ed Brubaker (\"Captain America\"), became well known for their mature and sometimes controversial takes on Marvel\u2019s characters. The 2010s saw the emergence of another new wave of talent, with writer Matt Fraction and artist David Aja turning in a visually arresting run on \"Hawkeye\", longtime Spider-Man writer Dan Slott teaming with artist Mike Allred for a bold take on a classic character in \"Silver Surfer\", and writer G. Willow Wilson and artist Adrian Alphona breaking new ground with their critically acclaimed \"Ms. Marvel\".\nIn the 21st century, Marvel\u2019s profits were increasingly derived from toys, video games, and other merchandise featuring their most popular characters and from the production of a string of commercially successful movies. Those films differed from prior efforts to translate comics to the big screen in that they were set in a single shared world. That ambitious plan generated huge dividends with \"The Avengers\" (2012), a film that featured Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America\u2014three heroes that had scored individual blockbuster successes\u2014and grossed more than $1.5 billion worldwide. The Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it came to be known, grew into one of the most lucrative franchises in film history. Its success spawned a wave of television programs, beginning with \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" (2013\u20132020) on ABC and continuing with \"Daredevil\" (2015\u201318), \"Jessica Jones\" (2015\u20132019), and \"Luke Cage\" (2016\u201318), a string of critically lauded series that appeared on Netflix. In 2015 an agreement between Disney and Sony brought Spider-Man (who had previously appeared only in Sony-produced films) into the shared universe; the character would subsequently be available for use by both studios. Marvel Studios, the company\u2019s film and television division, continued to set records with its flagship Avengers, but it also packed theatres with relatively unknown heroes such as the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014), \"Ant-Man\" (2015), and \"Doctor Strange\" (2016). By 2016 more than a dozen films had been released under the banner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the franchise\u2019s cumulative global box office receipts had topped $10 billion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"American","surface_form":"American","offset":123},{"uri":"Comic_book","surface_form":"comic
