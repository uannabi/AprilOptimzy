{"id":80508,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrastea_(moon)","text":"Adrastea or, is the second closest moon to Jupiter. It was found by David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson in \"Voyager 2\" probe photographs taken in 1979 and received the designation. In 1983, it was named after the mythological Adrastea, who was a daughter of Jupiter and Ananke.\nAdrastea was the first moon to be found from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft, rather than through telescopic photography.\nPhysical characteristics.\nAdrastea is non-spherical and measures 20x16x14 km\u00B3 across. What Adrastea is made of and the mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86 g/cm\u00B3) its mass can be estimated at ~2\u00D71015 kg. Amalthea's density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10-15%, and Adrastea may be similar.\nNo surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.\nOrbit.\nAdrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the closer moons to Jupiter. It orbits Jupiter at ~129,000\u00A0km (1.806 Jupiter radii) within the planet's Main Ring. The orbital eccentricity of ~0.0015 and inclination of ~ 0.03\u00B0 relative to the equator of Jupiter are very small.\nExploration.\nAdrastea was found in \"Voyager 1 and 2\" images, but appeared only as a dot. The \"Galileo\" spacecraft was able to see its shape, but the images remain poor.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":43},{"uri":"David_Jewitt","surface_form":"David C.
