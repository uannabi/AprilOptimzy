And that thousands of members of QAnon would be arrested by Trump.</comment>\nQAnon () is a disproven far-right conspiracy theory believing that a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring and are planning against US president Donald Trump, who is fighting the cabal.\nQAnon also believes that Trump is planning a day known as the \"Storm\", when thousands of members of the cabal will be arrested. No part of the conspiracy claim is based in fact.\nQAnon supporters have accused many liberal Hollywood actors, Democratic politicians, and high-ranking government officials of being members of the cabal.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Far-right","surface_form":"far-right","offset":181},{"uri":"Conspiracy_theory","surface_form":"conspiracy theory","offset":191},{"uri":"Cabal","surface_form":"cabal","offset":226},{"uri":"Satanism","surface_form":"Satan-worshipping","offset":235},{"uri":"Pedophilia","surface_form":"pedophiles","offset":253},{"uri":"Sex-trafficking","surface_form":"sex-trafficking","offset":290},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"US president","offset":336},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":349},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":611},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":629}]}
