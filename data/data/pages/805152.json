{"id":805152,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hot Jupiters are a class of gas giant exoplanets that are physically similar to Jupiter but have very short orbital periods (). The closeness to their stars and their high surface-atmosphere temperatures led to the nickname.\nHot Jupiters are the easiest extrasolar planets to detect via the radial-velocity method. The oscillations they induce in their parent stars' motion are large and rapid compared to those of other types of planets. One of the best-known hot Jupiters is. Discovered in 1995, it was the first extrasolar planet found orbiting a Sun-like star. has an orbital period of about 4\u00A0days.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Gas_giant","surface_form":"gas giant","offset":41},{"uri":"Exoplanet","surface_form":"exoplanet","offset":51},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":93},{"uri":"Orbital_period","surface_form":"orbital period","offset":121},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":228},{"uri":"Radial_velocity","surface_form":"radial-velocity","offset":304},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"star","offset":572},{"uri":"Orbital_period","surface_form":"orbital period","offset":585}]}
