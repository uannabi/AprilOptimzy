{"id":805160,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_tree_frog","text":"The Arabian tree frog or Sanchiang tree toad (\"Hyla felixarabica\") is a frog from the Middle East. Scientists saw it in Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Syria.\nScientists say there are two separate groups of Arabian tree frogs: one in the hills in Yemen and Asir Mountains in Saudia Arabia and another group in Syria, Israel and the hills in Jordan.\nScientists used to think that this was the same frog as the Middle East tree frog, but it is not. Scientists believe that the Arabian tree frog separated from the Middle East tree frog 8.4 million years ago. They believe the two groups of frogs were separated by the Dead Sea Rift and then became different species over time.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":72},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":86},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":120},{"uri":"Jordan","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":128},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":136},{"uri":"Yemen","surface_form":"Yemen","offset":150},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":160},{"uri":"Middle_East_tree_frog","surface_form":"Middle East tree frog","offset":417},{"uri":"Speciation","surface_form":"separated","offset":501},{"uri":"Dead_Sea","surface_form":"Dead Sea","offset":624}]}
