{"id":805195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_indicator","text":"Tripindicator.com is a travel metasearch engine and comparison website which provides dedicated price comparison of airport transfer, tourist attractions tickets, sightseeing tours, walking tours, food tours, day trips, night tours, etc. from leading attractions tickets websites including Viator, Tiqets, Ticketbar, GetYourGuide, Klook and Civitatis.\nHistory.\nTripindicator.com was founded in 2014 by Reddy Yattapu. The idea was originated when the founder Reddy Yattapu thought that there were lots of websites for flights, hotels and car rentals comparison but not one which enabled families and tourists to compare ticket prices of sightseeing tours and attractions and thus this would make a difference to those holiday budgets, while attractions would also feel the benefit with increased footfall. Tripindicator brought all this together by comparing the leading attractions tickets to providing travellers with the sightseeing tours and attractions through their tickets comparison site.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":23},{"uri":"Metasearch_engine","surface_form":"metasearch engine","offset":30}]}
