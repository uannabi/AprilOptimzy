It is a super heavy launch vehicle, meaning it is capable of lifting more than 50 tonnes of payload into Low Earth orbit, Starship is a fully reusable spacecraft, which will reduce the cost per launch dramatically.\nSpaceX had a test on December 9, 2020 which showed that it could fly to a high altitude, and was mostly a success, however it was not able to land soft enough, resulting in the loss of the SN8 Starship.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"SpaceX","surface_form":"SpaceX","offset":55},{"uri":"Aerospace_engineering","surface_form":"Aerospace","offset":73},{"uri":"Low_Earth_orbit","surface_form":"Low Earth orbit","offset":209}]}
