{"id":805241,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambudiri","text":"The Nambudiri, also transliterated Namb\u016Bdiri, Namboodiri, Namboothiri, and Namp\u016Btiri, are a Malayali Brahmin caste, native to what is now the state of Kerala, India.\nAs the traditional feudal elite, Nambudiris owned a large portion of the land in the region of Malabar until the Kerala Land Reforms starting in 1957. Nambudiris have been noted for their unique practices such as the adherence to srauta ritualism and orthodox tradition. Cyriac Pullapilly mentions that the dominating influence of the Nambudiris was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture of Kerala.\nOrigin.\nNambudiri mythology associates their immigration to Kerala from the banks of Narmada, Krishna, Kaveri rivers with the legendary creation of Kerala by Parasurama, the 6th avatar of Vishnu. According to this legend, the region was created when Parasurama threw his axe into the sea Although it is known that the present-day region of Kerala was once governed by the Chera dynasty, little information exists regarding its early ethnography.\nBrahmin presence in the Tamil country is attested from the Sangam period onward. Based on the fact that Nambudiris are P\u016Brva\u015Bikh\u0101 Brahmins wearing the traditional hair tuft on the front, T.P Mahadevan proposes that they are the descendants of these Sangam age Brahmins who moved west into the region of Malabar during the Kalabhra interregnum. This sets them apart from the later Apara\u015Bikh\u0101 Brahmin (wearing their hair tufts on the back) migrants to South India such as the Tamil Iyers. According to T.P Mahadevan, the Nambudiris brought with them a very early recension of the Mahabharata which became the basis of the Malayalam language version of the epic.\nAnthropologists Heike Moser and Paul Younger note that the Nambudiri Brahmin presence predates the 9th century, as attested by grants of land given to them by ruling families. According to the historian Romila Thapar, local kings and chiefs encouraged them to move to the area by offering such tax-exempt land grants in return for them officiating in Vedic rites that would legitimise the grantors' status as rulers. They also gained land and improved their influence over the socio-economic life of the region by helping rulers during the wars between the Chola and Chera dynasties when Vedic schools were turned into military academies.\nEarly history.\nOperating from their \"illam\" houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the janmi system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they \"established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste\". The Nambudiris have been described to be responsible for the Sanskrit influence on Malayalam, basically a Dravidian language, due to the Nambudiri Brahmin's mixing of Sanskrit and the local Tamil language.\nMedieval Kerala has been characterised as an oligarchy which was dominated by the Nambudiris, who owned all the temples and their subsidiary villages. The Nambudiris had influence with the ruling class through the practice of \"sambandam\", where younger Nambudiris used to have relationships with Kshatriya women or women from the upper sections of the Nair caste. The children of such unions were not considered Nambudiris, but a part of their matrilocal lineages. As a result of such unions, many kings and ruling chiefs in Kerala would be the offspring of Nambudiri fathers. These arrangements allowed the Nambudiris to gain political power in addition to religious and cultural dominance.\nThe Nambudiri's grip on land was maintained through the practice of strict primogeniture and patrilineal inheritance. Despite their younger members having hypergamous relationships with Nairs, whose caste traditions were matrilineal, Nambudiri families remained aloof from general society. Although the historian E. K. Pillai has claimed that the Nambudiris from the 1100s enforced matrilineal polyandry on the previously patrilineal communities of the area, sociologist Randall Collins thinks it is unlikely that such a change could be imposed and says that \"more probably it was the result of a process of marriage politics spread by emulation in the decentralised situation of status competition.\" Some other scholars believe that the matrilineal customs predate the period entirely and cite the queens of the Pandyan dynasty as evidence for this.\nModern history.\nThe unwillingness of Nambudiris to adapt to changes in wider society persisted until the early years of the 20th century but Susan Bayly believes that their decline in significance can be traced to the period 1729-1748 when Marthanda Varma established the Kingdom of Travancore and chose to use Deshastha Brahmins from Tamil Nadu in his civil service. She believes that decision undermined the relationship between the Nambudiri Brahmins and royalty in the region, although others have said that Varma's influence was short-lived and that the main cause of change was the arrival of British colonial administrators, such as Colin Macaulay and John Munro, from the early 1800s. After the passing of the Charter Acts of 1833 and 1853 in the British Parliament, the British encouraged the work of Christian missionaries, notably in provision of education, and began the introduction of a judicial system that would have a significant impact on the landholdings, inheritance customs and marriage arrangements of both the Nambudiris and Nairs. The traditional basis of life was challenged by these and other changes, affecting also the other major ethnic groups of the area, such as the Ezhavas and the Syrian Christians.\nEarly history.\nOperating from their \"illam\" houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the janmi system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they \"established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste\".

Although it may have largely died out elsewhere in India and thus be symptomatic of the community's resistance to change, David Knipe notes that it is still performed regularly in Andhra Pradesh and has been for centuries.\nAttire.\nTraditionally, they wore a simple cloth around the waist called a thorthu (or thortumundu), in domestic settings. When they had to travel, they wore two sets of cloth in addition known as a vasthram.\nNambudiris wore their traditional hair tufts (\"ku\u1E6Dumi\" or \"\u015Bikh\u0101\") on the front like the Dikshitars of Tamil Nadu.\nMarriage customs.\nAlthough it is certain that in theory hypergamy can cause a shortage of marriageable women in the lowest ranks of a caste and promote upwards social movement from the lower Nair subdivisions, the numbers involved would have been very small. It was not a common practice outside the higher subcaste groups and the Nambudiris had mostly stopped the practice by the 1920s.\nKoodiyattam (artform).\nThe form of Sanskrit theatre known as Koodiyattam, which is native to Kerala, was traditionally patronised by Nambudiris.{citation needed|date=September 2019","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Malayali_Brahmin","surface_form":"Malayali Brahmin","offset":92},{"uri":"Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala","offset":151},{"uri":"Land_reform_in_Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala Land Reforms","offset":279},{"uri":"%C5%9Arauta","surface_form":"srauta","offset":396},{"uri":"Cyriac_Pullapilly","surface_form":"Cyriac Pullapilly","offset":437},{"uri":"Narmada","surface_form":"Narmada","offset":691},{"uri":"Krishna_River","surface_form":"Krishna","offset":700},{"uri":"Kaveri","surface_form":"Kaveri","offset":709},{"uri":"Parasurama","surface_form":"Parasurama","offset":764},{"uri":"Vishnu","surface_form":"Vishnu","offset":794},{"uri":"Chera_dynasty","surface_form":"Chera dynasty","offset":978},{"uri":"Sangam_period","surface_form":"Sangam","offset":1111},{"uri":"Kalabhra_dynasty","surface_form":"Kalabhra","offset":1374},{"uri":"Iyer","surface_form":"Iyer","offset":1532},{"uri":"Mahabharata","surface_form":"Mahabharata","offset":1630},{"uri":"Romila_Thapar","surface_form":"Romila Thapar","offset":1915},{"uri":"Chola_dynasty","surface_form":"Chola","offset":2269},{"uri":"Illam","surface_form":"illam","offset":2388},{"uri":"Janmi","surface_form":"janmi","offset":2456},{"uri":"Malayalam","surface_form":"Malayalam","offset":2700},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":2784},{"uri":"Tamil_language","surface_form":"Tamil","offset":2807},{"uri":"Sambandam","surface_form":"sambandam","offset":3050},{"uri":"Primogeniture","surface_form":"primogeniture","offset":3590},{"uri":"Patrilineality","surface_form":"patrilineal","offset":3608},{"uri":"Hypergamy","surface_form":"hypergamous relationships","offset":3670},{"uri":"Nair","surface_form":"Nair","offset":3701},{"uri":"Matrilineality","surface_form":"matrilineal","offset":3736},{"uri":"Polyandry","surface_form":"polyandry","offset":3909},{"uri":"Randall_Collins","surface_form":"Randall Collins","offset":3986},{"uri":"Pandyan_dynasty","surface_form":"Pandyan dynasty","offset":4328},{"uri":"Susan_Bayly","surface_form":"Susan Bayly","offset":4507},{"uri":"Marthanda_Varma","surface_form":"Marthanda Varma","offset":4606},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Travancore","surface_form":"Kingdom of Travancore","offset":4638},{"uri":"Deshastha_Brahmin","surface_form":"Deshastha Brahmin","offset":4677},{"uri":"Tamil_Nadu","surface_form":"Tamil Nadu","offset":4701},{"uri":"Colin_Macaulay","surface_form":"Colin Macaulay","offset":5006},{"uri":"John_Munro%2C_9th_of_Teaninich","surface_form":"John Munro","offset":5025},{"uri":"Ezhava","surface_form":"Ezhava","offset":5564},{"uri":"Saint_Thomas_Christians","surface_form":"Syrian Christian","offset":5580},{"uri":"Illam","surface_form":"illam","offset":5636},{"uri":"Janmi","surface_form":"janmi","offset":5704},{"uri":"Malayalam","surface_form":"Malayalam","offset":5948},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":6032},{"uri":"Tamil_language","surface_form":"Tamil","offset":6055},{"uri":"Sambandam","surface_form":"sambandam","offset":6298},{"uri":"Primogeniture","surface_form":"primogeniture","offset":6838},{"uri":"Patrilineality","surface_form":"patrilineal","offset":6856},{"uri":"Hypergamy","surface_form":"hypergamous relationships","offset":6918},{"uri":"Nair","surface_form":"Nair","offset":6949},{"uri":"Matrilineality","surface_form":"matrilineal","offset":6984},{"uri":"Polyandry","surface_form":"polyandry","offset":7157},{"uri":"Randall_Collins","surface_form":"Randall Collins","offset":7234},{"uri":"Pandyan_dynasty","surface_form":"Pandyan dynasty","offset":7576},{"uri":"Susan_Bayly","surface_form":"Susan Bayly","offset":7755},{"uri":"Marthanda_Varma","surface_form":"Marthanda Varma","offset":7854},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Travancore","surface_form":"Kingdom of Travancore","offset":7886},{"uri":"Deshastha_Brahmin","surface_form":"Deshastha Brahmin","offset":7925},{"uri":"Tamil_Nadu","surface_form":"Tamil Nadu","offset":7949},{"uri":"Colin_Macaulay","surface_form":"Colin Macaulay","offset":8254},{"uri":"John_Munro%2C_9th_of_Teaninich","surface_form":"John Munro","offset":8273},{"uri":"Ezhava","surface_form":"Ezhava","offset":8812},{"uri":"Saint_Thomas_Christians","surface_form":"Syrian Christian","offset":8828},{"uri":"Shakha","surface_form":"recensions","offset":8883},{"uri":"Agnicayana","surface_form":"Agnicayana","offset":8959},{"uri":"Frits_Staal","surface_form":"Frits Staal","offset":9029},{"uri":"Andhra_Pradesh","surface_form":"Andhra Pradesh","offset":9343},{"uri":"Dikshitar","surface_form":"Dikshitar","offset":9683},{"uri":"Koodiyattam","surface_form":"Koodiyattam","offset":10158}]}
