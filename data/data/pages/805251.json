Even though settled in Kerala, most of the Embranthiries still speak Tulu as mother-tongue, and are considered as Tulu Brahmins.\nSome sects of Embranthiris have adopted the Malayali Brahmin surnames \"Namboothiri\" and \"Potti\" after arriving in Kerala. They are the followers of Vaishnavism. Because of their Vaishnava Dharma they mainly serve in Vishnu temples, Krishna temples and more than other gods.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Malayali","surface_form":"Malayali","offset":85},{"uri":"Brahmin","surface_form":"Brahmin","offset":94},{"uri":"Tulu_language","surface_form":"Tulu","offset":114},{"uri":"Brahmin","surface_form":"Brahmins","offset":144},{"uri":"Kerala","surface_form":"Kerala","offset":169},{"uri":"Tulu_Nadu","surface_form":"Tulu Nadu","offset":185},{"uri":"Udupi","surface_form":"Udupi","offset":208},{"uri":"Karnataka","surface_form":"Karnataka","offset":217},{"uri":"Tulu_language","surface_form":"Tulu","offset":298},{"uri":"Vaishnavism","surface_form":"Vaishnavism","offset":506}]}
