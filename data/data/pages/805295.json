{"id":805295,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdis","text":"Verdis, officially called the Free Republic of Verdis, is a micronation also known as an unrecognised sovereign state that started on an unclaimed piece of land (pocket 3 of the Croatia-Serbia border dispute) on the western part of the Danube River between Croatia and Serbia near Liberland. Verdis was founded on 30 May 2019 by Australian activist Daniel Jackson.\nThe official Verdis website, like Liberland's says the nation was created on no-man's land (terra nullius) that emerged because Croatia and Serbia have not been able to agree on their borders for over 25 years. This border dispute includes some areas to the east of the Danube which are claimed by both Serbia and Croatia. Croatia considers some areas on the west side of the river, including Verdis, to be part of Serbia, although Serbia no longer claims that land.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Micronation","surface_form":"micronation","offset":60}]}
