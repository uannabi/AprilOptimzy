{"id":805331,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole","text":"e=\"preserve\">A white hole is a hypothetical region in spacetime. It has \"not\" been proved to exist.\nIt is said to be the exact opposite of a black hole. While a black hole sucks in objects to its singularity, the white hole emits matter from its singularity. A white hole may be formed after a black hole can no longer suck things in. Immediately, it turns into a white hole and starts emitting the things that it has previously sucked in before. Nothing can enter a white hole as its emitting force is too great. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black hole, which can be entered only from the outside and from which energy-matter, light and information cannot escape.\nLike black holes, white holes have properties like mass, charge, and angular momentum. They attract matter like any other mass, but objects falling towards a white hole would never actually reach the white hole's event horizon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spacetime","surface_form":"spacetime","offset":54},{"uri":"Black_hole","surface_form":"black hole","offset":141},{"uri":"Gravitational_singularity","surface_form":"singularity","offset":196},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":725},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"charge","offset":731},{"uri":"Angular_momentum","surface_form":"angular momentum","offset":743},{"uri":"Event_horizon","surface_form":"event horizon","offset":887}]}
