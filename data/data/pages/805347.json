{"id":805347,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phumulani","text":"Phumulani is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing domestic violence and sexual abuse in communities of color throughout Minnesota and globally.\nHistory.\nPhumulani was founded by Comfort Dondo, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and domestic violence. Born and raised in Zimbabwe and now residing in Minnesota, Comfort\u2019s struggle with domestic violence was compounded by the inability of women\u2019s shelters in America to provide the language, cultural and societal resources she and her children needed to feel safe and supported. Often, she found herself back in her abuser\u2019s home with no alternative.\nNow free from the dangerous situation, Comfort wants to make sure women and children of African descent have the cultural resources they need to feel comfortable in sharing their stories and recovering from their experiences. She understands firsthand that individuals who\u2019ve fled African countries to save their lives often have lasting trauma that needs to be acknowledged and treated holistically to ensure long-term progress.\nMeaning Of The Name Phumulani:.\n\"Comfort created Phumulani, named for a Zulu word meaning \u201Clover of peace,\u201D as a way of helping African immigrants and refugees in Minnesota. It is truly a place where survivors of gender-based abuse and violence can find peace and recovery.\"\nTO STOP VIOLENCE AND ABUSE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.\nPhumulani is a non-profit organization dedicated to preventing domestic violence and sexual abuse in communities of color throughout Minnesota and the nation. By providing culturally-specific resources to women and girls of African descent, we hope to change the cycle of gender-based abuse in the vulnerable populations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nonprofit_organization","surface_form":"nonprofit organization","offset":15},{"uri":"Zimbabwe","surface_form":"Zimbabwe","offset":284},{"uri":"Zulu_language","surface_form":"Zulu","offset":1116},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"African immigrants","offset":1172},{"uri":"Refugee","surface_form":"refugees","offset":1195},{"uri":"Abuse","surface_form":"ABUSE OF WOMEN","offset":1340}]}
