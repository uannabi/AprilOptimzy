It was the first quasi-satellite to be found around a planet in the Solar System. It looks like it travels around venus during one Venerean year but it actually orbits the Sun, not Venus.\nDiscovery, orbit and physical properties.\nIt was discovered on 11 November 2002 at Lowell Observatory. It has a semi-major axis of 0.7237 AU. Its eccentricity is 0.4104. Its orbital inclination is 9.0060\u00B0. It is calculated to measure 236 meters in diameters. Its rotational period is 13.5 hours.\nPotentially hazardous asteroid.\n2002 VE68 is in the Minor Planet Center list of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) because it frequently comes as close as 0.05 AU (7,479,894 km) to Earth. It comes as close as 0.04 AU (5,983,915 km) every 8 years.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":38},{"uri":"Quasi-satellite","surface_form":"quasi-satellite","offset":63},{"uri":"Venus","surface_form":"Venus","offset":82},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":143},{"uri":"Solar_System","surface_form":"Solar System","offset":157},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbits","offset":250},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":261},{"uri":"Lowell_Observatory","surface_form":"Lowell Observatory","offset":360},{"uri":"Semi-major_axis","surface_form":"semi-major axis","offset":389},{"uri":"Eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":423},{"uri":"Orbital_inclination","surface_form":"orbital inclination","offset":451},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameters","offset":525},{"uri":"Minor_Planet_Center","surface_form":"Minor Planet Center","offset":625},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":758}]}
