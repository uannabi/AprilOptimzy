{"id":805357,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-satellite","text":"A quasi-satellite is an astronomical object that crosses a planet's orbit during its own orbit.\nA quasi-satellite's orbit around the Sun takes exactly the same time as the planet's orbit. Its eccentricity is different from the eccentricity of the planet. The orbits of quasi-satellites are unstable and over time they will break free from the planet's gravity.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Astronomical_object","surface_form":"astronomical object","offset":24},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet's","offset":59},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":68},{"uri":"Eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":192},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":352}]}
