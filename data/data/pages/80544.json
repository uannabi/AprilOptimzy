{"id":80544,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydome_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Eurydome or, is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.\nEurydome is about 3\u00A0kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,231,000\u00A0km in 723.359 days, at an inclination of 149\u00B0 to the ecliptic (147\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.3770.\nIt was named in August 2003 after Eurydome in Greek mythology, who is sometimes described as the mother of the Graces by Zeus (Jupiter).\nEurydome belongs to the Pasipha\u00EB group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Jupiter%27s_moons","surface_form":"moon","offset":31},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":39},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":95},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
