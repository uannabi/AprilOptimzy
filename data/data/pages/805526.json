{"id":805526,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abusir_Papyri","text":"The Abusir Papyri are the largest find of papiri so far. They are from the Old Kingdom in ancient Egypt.\nThe first papyri were discovered in 1893 at Abu Gorab near Abusir in northern Egypt.\nThey were written about the 24th century BC during the Fifth dynasty of Egypt. They are just fragments, but they are some of the oldest surviving papyri we have. Later on many more fragments were found in the area.\nTheir content.\nThe Abusir papyri tell about the running of a royal mortuary temple. There are duty rosters for priests, lists of temple equipment, lists of daily offerings to the temples at Abu Gorab, north of Abusir. Also, there are letters and permits.\nThe fragments bear the remains of two different writings.\nThe introduction is written in hieroglyphs. It starts with a date referring to the reign of Djedkare Isesi. This dates the manuscripts near the end of the Fifth Dynasty.\nThe fragmented papyri are written in columns divided into three horizontal registers.\nThe text on the right summarizes allocations of grain. All writings were done in what is called the hieratic script. That is the original writing done in ink with reed pens on papyrus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Papyrus","surface_form":"papiri","offset":42},{"uri":"Old_Kingdom","surface_form":"Old Kingdom","offset":75},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"ancient Egypt","offset":90},{"uri":"Abu_Gorab","surface_form":"Abu Gorab","offset":149},{"uri":"Abusir","surface_form":"Abusir","offset":164},{"uri":"24th_century_BC","surface_form":"24th century BC","offset":218},{"uri":"Fifth_dynasty","surface_form":"Fifth dynasty","offset":245},{"uri":"Mortuary","surface_form":"mortuary","offset":472},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":481},{"uri":"Roster","surface_form":"roster","offset":504},{"uri":"Priests","surface_form":"priests","offset":516},{"uri":"Temple","surface_form":"temple","offset":534},{"uri":"Abu_Gorab","surface_form":"Abu Gorab","offset":595},{"uri":"Egyptian_hieroglyphs","surface_form":"hieroglyphs","offset":749},{"uri":"Djedkare_Isesi","surface_form":"Djedkare Isesi","offset":810},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":1022},{"uri":"Hieratic","surface_form":"hieratic","offset":1074},{"uri":"Papyrus","surface_form":"papyrus","offset":1150}]}
