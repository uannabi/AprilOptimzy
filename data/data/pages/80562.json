{"id":80562,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpalyke_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Harpalyke or, is a non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the designation. In August 2003,the moon was named after Harpalyke, the incestuous daughter of Klymenos, who was in some accounts a lover of Zeus (Jupiter).\nHarpalyke belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured asteroid. It is about 4 kilometres in diameter and appears grey similar to C-type asteroids. The moon orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,064,000\u00A0km in 624.542 days, at an inclination of 147\u00B0 to the ecliptic (147\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator) with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2441.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":36},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":54},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":110},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
