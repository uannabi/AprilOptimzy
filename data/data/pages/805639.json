{"id":805639,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_tree_frog","text":"The Middle East tree frog (\"Hyla savignyi\"), also known as the Lemon yellow tree frog, Savigny's tree frog, is a frog from the Middle East. It can be found in Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.\nThis frog can live in places that are very hot and dry. Unless it is the breeding season, this frog hides during the day and moves around at night. Adult frogs eat arthropods, for example insects, and tadpoles eat plants and animals. The tadpoles turn into frogs at different times of year depending on how high up a mountain they are.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Frog","surface_form":"frog","offset":113},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":127},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":159},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":166},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":174},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":182},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":189},{"uri":"Iran","surface_form":"Iran","offset":195},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":201},{"uri":"Azerbaijan","surface_form":"Azerbaijan","offset":210},{"uri":"Georgia","surface_form":"Georgia","offset":225},{"uri":"Arthropod","surface_form":"arthropod","offset":398}]}
