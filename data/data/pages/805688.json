{"id":805688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattan","text":"Rattan (from the Malay \"rotan\") is the name for about 600 species of old world climbing palms.\nThey belong to the subfamily Calamoideae.\nRattan is also known as \"manila\", or \"malacca\", after the ports of Manila and Malacca City, and as \"manau\" (from the Malay \"rotan manau\", the trade name for \"Calamus manan\" canes in Southeast Asia).\nThe climbing habit comes with a flexible woody stem, got from a secondary growth. This makes rattan a liana rather than a normal or true wood. It grows much faster than most tropical wood.\n'Dragon's blood' is a red resin used in dyes, varnishes and incense. It can come from the fruit of a rattan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Malay_language","surface_form":"Malay","offset":17},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":58},{"uri":"Old_world","surface_form":"old world","offset":69},{"uri":"Climbing_plants","surface_form":"climbing","offset":79},{"uri":"Palm","surface_form":"palm","offset":88},{"uri":"Subfamily","surface_form":"subfamily","offset":114},{"uri":"Manila","surface_form":"Manila","offset":204},{"uri":"Malacca_City","surface_form":"Malacca City","offset":215},{"uri":"Malay_language","surface_form":"Malay","offset":254},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":319},{"uri":"Climbing_plant","surface_form":"climbing habit","offset":340},{"uri":"Plant_stem","surface_form":"stem","offset":383},{"uri":"Liana","surface_form":"liana","offset":438},{"uri":"Wood","surface_form":"wood","offset":473},{"uri":"Resin","surface_form":"resin","offset":551},{"uri":"Dyes","surface_form":"dyes","offset":565},{"uri":"Varnish","surface_form":"varnish","offset":571},{"uri":"Incense","surface_form":"incense","offset":585}]}
