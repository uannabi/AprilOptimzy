It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.\nOrthosie is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,568,000\u00A0km in 602.619 days, at an inclination of 142\u00B0 to the ecliptic (143\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2433.\nIt was named in August 2003 after Orthosie, the Greek goddess of prosperity and one of the Horae. The Horae (Hours) were daughters of Zeus and Themis.\nOrthosie belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000\u00A0km, at inclinations of about 150\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":31},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":39},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":95},{"uri":"Scott_Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott Sheppard","offset":123},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":300},{"uri":"Ecliptic","surface_form":"ecliptic","offset":327},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"orbital eccentricity","offset":373},{"uri":"Orthosie","surface_form":"Orthosie","offset":439},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek","offset":453},{"uri":"Goddess","surface_form":"goddess","offset":459},{"uri":"Horae","surface_form":"Horae","offset":496},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":539},{"uri":"Themis","surface_form":"Themis","offset":548},{"uri":"Ananke_group","surface_form":"Ananke group","offset":580},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":609}]}
