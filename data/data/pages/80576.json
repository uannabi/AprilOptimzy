{"id":80576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism","text":"e=\"preserve\">Expressionism is an art and cultural movement of the 20th century.\nExpressionist artists try to express a feeling with what they create. Colours and shapes are not used in a way people see them, but as the artist feels them.\nExpressionism emerged as an 'avant-garde movement' in poetry and painting before the First World War. In the Weimar years it was appreciated by a mass audience, peaking in popularity in 1920s Berlin.\nExpressionism presents the world as subjective: how the artist feels it, not how it is scientifically. The art looks to get an emotional effect, and transmits personal moods and ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of \"being alive\" and emotional experience rather than physical reality.\nExpressionism is exhibited in many art forms, including: painting, literature, theatre, dance, film, architecture and music. The term often implies emotional angst. In a general sense, painters such El Greco could be called expressionist; in practice, the term is applied only to 20th century works.\nThe Expressionist stress on the individual perspective was also a reaction to positivism and other artistic movements such as naturalism and impressionism.\nTypical modern expressionists are Edvard Munch (\"The Scream\"), August Macke, Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde, Marc Chagall, and others. The First World War, with the many young men who died, left deep impressions on artists' minds.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":33},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultural","offset":41},{"uri":"Avant-garde","surface_form":"avant-garde","offset":267},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":323},{"uri":"Weimar_Republic","surface_form":"Weimar years","offset":347},{"uri":"Subjective","surface_form":"subjective","offset":474},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":782},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painting","offset":804},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":814},{"uri":"Theatre","surface_form":"theatre","offset":826},{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":835},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"film","offset":842},{"uri":"Architecture","surface_form":"architecture","offset":848},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":865},{"uri":"Angst","surface_form":"angst","offset":905},{"uri":"El_Greco","surface_form":"El Greco","offset":946},{"uri":"Positivism","surface_form":"positivism","offset":1125},{"uri":"Naturalism","surface_form":"naturalism","offset":1173},{"uri":"Impressionism","surface_form":"impressionism","offset":1188},{"uri":"Edvard_Munch","surface_form":"Edvard Munch","offset":1237},{"uri":"August_Macke","surface_form":"August Macke","offset":1266},{"uri":"Ernst-Ludwig_Kirchner","surface_form":"Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner","offset":1280},{"uri":"Emil_Nolde","surface_form":"Emil Nolde","offset":1303},{"uri":"Marc_Chagall","surface_form":"Marc Chagall","offset":1315},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":1345}]}
