It was found in 2001 by astronomers at the University of Hawaii, and was originally designated as.\nKale is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,409,000 km in 685.324 days, at an orbital inclination of 165\u00B0 to the ecliptic (166\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.2011.\nIt was named in August 2003 after one of the Charites (Greek \u03A7\u03AC\u03C1\u03B9\u03C4\u03B5\u03C2, Latin \"Gratiae\", \"Graces\"), daughters of Zeus (Jupiter). Kale is the spouse of Hephaestus according to some authors (although most have Aphrodite play that role).\nIt belongs to the Carme group, made up of non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000 km and at an inclination of about 165\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":31},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":49},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":74},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":101},{"uri":"Orbital_inclination","surface_form":"orbital inclination","offset":279},{"uri":"Ecliptic","surface_form":"ecliptic","offset":314},{"uri":"Eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricity","offset":360},{"uri":"Charites","surface_form":"Charites","offset":429},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":495},{"uri":"Hephaestus","surface_form":"Hephaestus","offset":533},{"uri":"Aphrodite","surface_form":"Aphrodite","offset":590},{"uri":"Carme_group","surface_form":"Carme group","offset":635}]}
