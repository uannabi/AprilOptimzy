The affair was revealed by satiric newspaper \"Le Canard Encha\u00EEn\u00E9\" on October 10, 1979, towards the end of Giscard's presidency.\nMany believe this was the reason for Giscard losing his 1981 reelection bid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":43},{"uri":"French_Republic","surface_form":"5th French Republic","offset":116},{"uri":"Minister_of_Finance","surface_form":"Minister of Finance","offset":150},{"uri":"Val%C3%A9ry_Giscard_d%27Estaing","surface_form":"Val\u00E9ry Giscard d'Estaing","offset":188},{"uri":"Central_African_Empire","surface_form":"Central African Empire","offset":263},{"uri":"Bokassa_I","surface_form":"Bokassa I","offset":286},{"uri":"Le_Canard_Encha%C3%AEn%C3%A9","surface_form":"Le Canard Encha\u00EEn\u00E9","offset":343},{"uri":"1981_French_presidential_election","surface_form":"1981 reelection bid","offset":481}]}
