It is more of how the President of France should use their power.\n\"Neo-Gaullism\" has been used to describe a movement after the death of de Gaulle in 1970 from people who are economic liberal than both traditional and social Gaullism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":89},{"uri":"French_Resistance","surface_form":"French Resistance","offset":102},{"uri":"Charles_de_Gaulle","surface_form":"Charles de Gaulle","offset":135},{"uri":"Political_ideology","surface_form":"political ideology","offset":187},{"uri":"Left-wing_politics","surface_form":"left","offset":225},{"uri":"Right-wing_politics","surface_form":"right","offset":233},{"uri":"President_of_France","surface_form":"President of France","offset":262},{"uri":"Economic_liberal","surface_form":"economic liberal","offset":415}]}
