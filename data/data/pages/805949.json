{"id":805949,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Gonzales","text":"Ricardo Alonso \"Pancho\" Gonz\u00E1lez (May 9, 1928 \u2013 July 3, 1995), known sometimes as Richard Gonzales, was an American tennis player. He won 14 major singles titles (12 Pro Slam events, 2 Grand Slam events).\nGonzales was the world's leading professional player at a time when almost all players were amateur. His peak was from about 1952 to about 1958. He won many professional and open titles. He was always a serve-and-volley player at a time when many amateurs played a baseline game.\nWhen he first turned professional, the reigning top man was Jack Kramer. At first, Kramer crushed him. Gonzales semi-retired in 1950/51. When he came back in late 1951, Gonzales was much improved. He reached the top in 1952, winning the professional hard-court title in Los Angeles.\nThe Tennis Hall of Fame says Gonzales rose to the rank of number one in 1952.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tennis","surface_form":"tennis","offset":116},{"uri":"Major_professional_tennis_tournaments_before_the_Open_Era","surface_form":"Pro Slam events","offset":166},{"uri":"Grand_Slam_(tennis)","surface_form":"Grand Slam events","offset":185},{"uri":"Serve-and-volley","surface_form":"serve-and-volley","offset":408},{"uri":"Baseline","surface_form":"baseline","offset":470},{"uri":"Jack_Kramer","surface_form":"Jack Kramer","offset":545},{"uri":"Los_Angeles","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":755},{"uri":"Tennis_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Tennis Hall of Fame","offset":772}]}
