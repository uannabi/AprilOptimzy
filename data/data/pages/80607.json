It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the designation.\nIocaste orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,723,000\u00A0km in 609.427 days, at an inclination of 147\u00B0 to the ecliptic (146\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator) with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2874.\nIt was named in October 2002 after Jocasta, the mother/wife of Oedipus in Greek mythology.\nIocaste belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured asteroid.\nThe moon is about 5 kilometres in diameter and appears grey, similar to C-type asteroids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":34},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":52},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":108},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
