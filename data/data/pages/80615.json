It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003. It received the designation.\nAoede is about in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of in 714.657 days, at an inclination of 160\u00B0 to the ecliptic (162\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.6012.\nIt was named in March 2005 after A\u0153de, one of the three original Muses. A\u0153de was the Muse of song, and was a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter) by Mnemosyne.\nAoede belongs to the Pasipha\u00EB group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between and, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":28},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":36},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":71},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":92},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
