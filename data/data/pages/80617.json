This edition was started in January, 2002 and has over articles. It is currently the 8th largest edition by article count.\n2011 mass blanking protest.\nVolunteers on the Italian Wikipedia decided they did not like a proposed law before the Italian Parliament. The proposal was from October 4 to October 6 2011. During this time, all of the site's articles were hidden. Wikipedia's administrators blocked the website which was being debated at the time in the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian parliament.\nThis was the first time that a Wikipedia had blanked all its content to protest. The Wikimedia Foundation released a statement on October 4. The Foundation Board officially supported the short closing of Italian Wikipedia. In October 2011, the manifesto, which replaced the Italian Wikipedia, had been viewed approximately 19 million times. On October 6, 2011, the website content was put back. Wikipedia added a banner across the top of each page explaining the reason for the protest.\nItalian newspaper Il Tempo journalist Alberto Di Majo described the closure of the Italian-language Wikipedia as an \"unexpected merit\" of the proposed law. Some people questioned whether a non-profit United States foundation should try to change laws written in Italy.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":26},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian-language","offset":67},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":95},{"uri":"Camera_dei_Deputati","surface_form":"Chamber of Deputies","offset":564},{"uri":"Italian_parliament","surface_form":"Italian parliament","offset":591},{"uri":"Wikimedia_Foundation","surface_form":"Wikimedia Foundation","offset":696},{"uri":"Il_Tempo","surface_form":"Il Tempo","offset":1116}]}
