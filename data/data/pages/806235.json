{"id":806235,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow","text":"A spherical cow is a metaphor that is used when a complex scientific model is made more simple than it really should be.\nThe words \"spherical cow\" came from a joke where a dairy farmer talks to a theoretical physicist about how to get more prices for his milk. The physicist later talks about an answer to the problem at a seminar. The physicist says \"First, we assume a spherical cow...\" Sometimes, a \"spherical horse\" is used instead of a cow. For example, there is a joke about a physicist who says that he can find out who will win a race if it had a \"spherical horse moving through a vacuum\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":21},{"uri":"Scientific_model","surface_form":"scientific model","offset":58},{"uri":"Joke","surface_form":"joke","offset":159},{"uri":"Dairy_farming","surface_form":"dairy farmer","offset":172},{"uri":"Theoretical_physicist","surface_form":"theoretical physicist","offset":196},{"uri":"Seminar","surface_form":"seminar","offset":323},{"uri":"Assume","surface_form":"assume","offset":362},{"uri":"Win","surface_form":"win","offset":532},{"uri":"Racing","surface_form":"race","offset":538},{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":589}]}
