{"id":806277,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election","text":"A general election was held on the 10 October 1974 to elect all 635 members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The Labour Party won the election with a very small majority of 3 seats and Harold Wilson stayed as Prime Minister.\nThis was the second general election to happen in 1974. The last election in February ended in a hung parliament and no parties wanted to start a coalition government. This meant Labour had to start a minority government. This is why a second election was held, because governments are very hard to run if they do not have a majority.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"General_election","surface_form":"general election","offset":2},{"uri":"List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_October_1974","surface_form":"635 members","offset":64},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons of the United Kingdom","offset":83},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":127},{"uri":"Majority","surface_form":"majority","offset":175},{"uri":"Harold_Wilson","surface_form":"Harold Wilson","offset":199},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":223},{"uri":"February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"last election in February","offset":299},{"uri":"Hung_parliament","surface_form":"hung parliament","offset":336},{"uri":"Coalition_government","surface_form":"coalition government","offset":385},{"uri":"Minority_government","surface_form":"minority government","offset":440}]}
