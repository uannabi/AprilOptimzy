{"id":806279,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election","text":"A general election was held on 28 February 1974 to elect all 635 members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The election ended in a hung parliament as no party had a majority. Nobody agreed to start a coalition, so Labour had to start a minority government (as they had won the most seats), and Harold Wilson became Prime Minister.\nIt is very hard to run a government if the party has no majority, and so the House of Commons agreed to hold another general election in October. This was done so that a party could win a majority.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"General_election","surface_form":"general election","offset":2},{"uri":"List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_February_1974","surface_form":"635 members","offset":61},{"uri":"House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"House of Commons of the United Kingdom","offset":80},{"uri":"Hung_parliament","surface_form":"hung parliament","offset":144},{"uri":"Majority","surface_form":"majority","offset":178},{"uri":"Coalition","surface_form":"coalition","offset":213},{"uri":"Labour_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Labour","offset":227},{"uri":"Minority_government","surface_form":"minority government","offset":249},{"uri":"Harold_Wilson","surface_form":"Harold Wilson","offset":307},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":328},{"uri":"October_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election","surface_form":"another general election in October","offset":453}]}
