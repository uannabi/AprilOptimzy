It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2002, and got the designation.\nArche is about 3 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,717,000 km in 746.185 days, at an inclination of 165\u00B0 to the ecliptic (162\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.149.\nIt was named in 2005 after Arche, whom some Greek writers described as one of the four original Muses, an addition to the earlier three (Aoede, Melete, and Mneme).\nArche belongs to the Carme group, made up of non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000 km and at an inclination of about 165\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":28},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":36},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":92},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
