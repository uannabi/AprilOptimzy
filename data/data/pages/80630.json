It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and got the designation.\nEukelade is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,484,000\u00A0km in 735.200 days, at an inclination of 164\u00B0 to the ecliptic (165\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2829.\nIt was named in March 2005 after Eukelade, described by some Greek writers as one of the Muses, and thus a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter).\nEukelade belongs to the Carme group, made up of non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000\u00A0km and at an inclination of about 165\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":35},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":53},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":109},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
