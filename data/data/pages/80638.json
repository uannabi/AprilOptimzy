{"id":80638,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(books)","text":"Many novels of great length do not have chapters. Non-fiction books, especially those used for reference, almost always have chapters for ease of navigation. In these works, chapters are often subdivided into sections. The chapters of reference works are almost always listed in a table of contents. Novels sometimes use a table of contents, but not always.\nIn ancient civilizations, books were often in the form of papyrus scrolls, which contained about the same amount of text as a typical chapter in a modern book. This is the reason chapters in recent reproductions and translations of works of these periods are often presented as \"Book 1\", \"Book 2\", etc.\nTracks on a DVD or laserdisc are also called chapters.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":5},{"uri":"Non-fiction","surface_form":"Non-fiction","offset":50},{"uri":"Table_of_contents","surface_form":"table of contents","offset":281},{"uri":"Civilization","surface_form":"civilization","offset":369},{"uri":"Papyrus","surface_form":"papyrus","offset":416},{"uri":"Scroll","surface_form":"scroll","offset":424},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":673},{"uri":"Laserdisc","surface_form":"laserdisc","offset":680}]}
