{"id":806447,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system","text":"=\"preserve\">A Dynamical system is a mathematical model of a process, that is dependent on time. The process is homogeneous, it only depends on the initial state. The current terminology was established by Henri Poincar\u00E9 and George David Birkhoff.\nDynamical systems are very common. Examples are the movement of a pendulum in physics, or the predator-prey equations in biology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematical_model","surface_form":"mathematical model","offset":36},{"uri":"Process","surface_form":"process","offset":60},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":90},{"uri":"Henri_Poincar%C3%A9","surface_form":"Henri Poincar\u00E9","offset":205},{"uri":"George_David_Birkhoff","surface_form":"George David Birkhoff","offset":224},{"uri":"Pendulum","surface_form":"pendulum","offset":313},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":325},{"uri":"Predator-prey_equations","surface_form":"predator-prey equations","offset":341},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":368}]}
