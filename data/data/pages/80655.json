{"id":80655,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponde_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Sponde or, is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.\nSponde is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,253,000\u00A0km in 771.604 days, at an inclination of 154\u00B0 to the ecliptic (156\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.443.\nIt was named in August 2003 after one of the Horae (Hours), which presided over the seventh hour (libations poured after lunch). The Hours, goddesses of the time of day but also of the seasons, were daughters of Zeus (Jupiter) and Themis.\nIt belongs to the Pasipha\u00EB group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":29},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":37},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":93},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
