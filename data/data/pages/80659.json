{"id":80659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Uhud","text":"The Battle of Uhud () was fought on 23 March 625 (3 Shawwal 3 AH of the Islamic calendar) at Mount Uhud, in what is now north-western Saudi Arabia. It occurred between a force from the Muslim community of Medina led by Muhammad, and a force led by Abu Sufyan from Mecca, the town from which many of the Muslims had previously emigrated (\"hijra\"). The Battle of Uhud was the second military encounter between the Meccans and the Muslims, after the Battle of Badr in 624, where a small Muslim army had defeated the larger Meccan army.\nFor the Muslims, the battle was a big setback.\nBackground.\nMuhammad had preached the religion of Islam in Mecca from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also had opposition from the rest of the Quraysh, the clan that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as \"Yathrib\"). They considered themselves to be in a state of war with Mecca and raided Meccan caravans that had Muslim belongings left in Mecca. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 624, a small Muslim force had defeated the much larger Meccan army.\nMany Muslims considered this beany victory a proof that they had been favored by God (Arabic: Allah), and believed they were assured such victories in the future.\nBattle.\nQuraysh soldiers met the Muslims at Uhud. The Muslims got attacked from behind and lost the battle.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shawwal","surface_form":"Shawwal","offset":52},{"uri":"3_AH","surface_form":"3 AH","offset":60},{"uri":"Islamic_calendar","surface_form":"Islamic calendar","offset":72},{"uri":"Saudi_Arabia","surface_form":"Saudi Arabia","offset":134},{"uri":"Occur","surface_form":"occurred","offset":151},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":185},{"uri":"Medina","surface_form":"Medina","offset":205},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":219},{"uri":"Abu_Sufyan","surface_form":"Abu Sufyan","offset":248},{"uri":"Mecca","surface_form":"Mecca","offset":264},{"uri":"Hijra_(Islam)","surface_form":"hijra","offset":338},{"uri":"Battle_of_Badr","surface_form":"Battle of Badr","offset":447},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":592},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":630},{"uri":"Quraysh","surface_form":"Quraysh","offset":756},{"uri":"Clan","surface_form":"clan","offset":769},{"uri":"Persecution","surface_form":"persecution","offset":862},{"uri":"Battle_of_Badr","surface_form":"Battle of Badr","offset":1160},{"uri":"Beany","surface_form":"beany","offset":1275},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":1332},{"uri":"Allah","surface_form":"Allah","offset":1340}]}
