It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.\nHermippe is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,182,000\u00A0km in 629.809 days, at an orbital inclination of 151\u00B0 to the ecliptic (149\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.2290.\nIt was named in August 2003 by the IAU, after Hermippe, a lover of Zeus (Jupiter).\nHermippe belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000\u00A0km, at inclinations of about 150\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":31},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":39},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":95},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
