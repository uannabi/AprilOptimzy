{"id":80678,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bruch","text":"Max Christian Friedrich Bruch (6 January 1838\u20132 October 1920) also known as Max Karl August Bruch, was a German Romantic composer and conductor who wrote over 200 works, including three violin concertos, one of which is a staple of the violin repertoire.\nBruch was born in Cologne. He had a long career as a teacher, conductor and composer, moving among musical posts in Germany: Mannheim (1862-1864), Koblenz (1865-1867), Sondershausen, (1867-1870) Berlin (1870-1872), Bonn, where he spent 1873 -1878 working privately. At the height of his reputation he spent three seasons as conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society (1880-83). He taught composition at the \"Berlin Hochschule f\u00FCr Musik\" (the Berlin Conservatoire) from 1890 until his retirement in 1910.\nHis conservatively structured works, in the German romantic musical tradition, placed him in the camp of Romantic classicism exemplified by Johannes Brahms, rather than the opposing \"New Music\" of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. In his time, he was known primarily as a choral composer.\nHis \"Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor\", Op. 26 (1868) is one of the most popular Romantic violin concertos. It uses several techniques from Felix Mendelssohn's \"Violin Concerto in E minor\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":105},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":112},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":121},{"uri":"Conducting","surface_form":"conductor","offset":134},{"uri":"Violin_concerto","surface_form":"violin concerto","offset":186},{"uri":"Cologne","surface_form":"Cologne","offset":273},{"uri":"Mannheim","surface_form":"Mannheim","offset":380},{"uri":"Koblenz","surface_form":"Koblenz","offset":402},{"uri":"Sondershausen","surface_form":"Sondershausen","offset":423},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":450},{"uri":"Royal_Liverpool_Philharmonic_Society","surface_form":"Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society","offset":596},{"uri":"Berlin_Hochschule_f%C3%BCr_Musik","surface_form":"Berlin Hochschule f\u00FCr Musik","offset":674},{"uri":"Johannes_Brahms","surface_form":"Johannes Brahms","offset":910},{"uri":"Franz_Liszt","surface_form":"Franz Liszt","offset":967},{"uri":"Richard_Wagner","surface_form":"Richard Wagner","offset":983},{"uri":"Violin_Concerto_No._1_(Bruch)","surface_form":"Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor","offset":1062},{"uri":"Romantic_music","surface_form":"Romantic","offset":1138},{"uri":"Felix_Mendelssohn","surface_form":"Felix Mendelssohn","offset":1197},{"uri":"Violin_Concerto_(Mendelssohn)","surface_form":"Violin Concerto in E minor","offset":1218}]}
