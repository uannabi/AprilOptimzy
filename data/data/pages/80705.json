It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard, \"et al.\" in 2000, and given the designation.\nTaygete is about 5 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,439,000\u00A0km in 686.675 days, at an inclination of 165\u00B0 to the ecliptic (163\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.3678.\nHistory.\nIt was named in October 2002 after Taygete, one of the Pleiades, daughter of the Titan Atlas and mother of Lacedaemon by Zeus (Jupiter).\nIt belongs to the Carme group, made up of non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000\u00A0km and at an inclination of about 165\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":33},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":51},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":107},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
