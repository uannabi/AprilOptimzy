{"id":807059,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylarana","text":"\"Hylarana\" is a genus of true frogs. They are also called golden-backed frogs. They live in tropical Asia. Scientists used to put 84 to 96 valid species in \"Hylarana\", but they looked at the frogs again. Today, scientists say four species are in \"Hylarana\".\nWhat they look like.\n\"Hylarana\" frogs can be small or large. Male frogs are from their noses to the ends of their bodies, and females are. The nostrils are oval in shape and there is a piece of skin on top of them. The ear drum is not covered by skin. They have vomerine teeth and a parietal eye. The toes on their back feet are webbed, but the fingers on the front feet are not.\nWhere they live.\nThe frogs that scientists used to say were in \"Hylarana\" lived everywhere from Sri Lanka to the Western Ghat Mountains in India, through Nepal and southern China and Taiwan, south to Southeast Asia to the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, in Northern Australia, and tropical Africa. The four species of frogs that are still in \"Hylarana\" today live in southern and southeast Asia.\nScientific groups.\n\"Hylarana\" is in the subfamily Raninae. They are true frogs, so they are in the family Ranidae. The name \"Hylarana\" comes from from the New Latin word \"hyle\" (\"wood\" or \"forest\") and \"rana\" (\"frog\"). Scientists used to think \"Hylarana\" was a subgenus of the genus \"Rana\", but they changed their minds in 2005. In 2006, scientists took \"Hylarana\" and split it into more genera. They treat these as junior synonyms of \"Hylarana\". In 2015, Oliver et al. looked closely at \"Hylarana\" again. They said that only four species are really \"Hylarana sensu stricto\": The other frogs were moved to \"Abavorana, Amnirana, Chalcorana, Humerana, Hydrophylax, Indosylvirana, Papurana, Pulchrana\", and \"Sylvirana\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":16},{"uri":"True_frog","surface_form":"true frog","offset":25},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":92},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":101},{"uri":"Valid_name_(zoology)","surface_form":"valid","offset":139},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":145},{"uri":"Tympanum_(anatomy)","surface_form":"ear drum","offset":477},{"uri":"Vomerine_teeth","surface_form":"vomerine teeth","offset":520},{"uri":"Sri_Lanka","surface_form":"Sri Lanka","offset":734},{"uri":"Western_Ghats","surface_form":"Western Ghat Mountains","offset":751},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":777},{"uri":"Nepal","surface_form":"Nepal","offset":792},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":811},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":821},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"Southeast Asia","offset":838},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":860},{"uri":"Papua_New_Guinea","surface_form":"Papua New Guinea","offset":876},{"uri":"Northern_Australia","surface_form":"Northern Australia","offset":897},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":930},{"uri":"Southeast_Asia","surface_form":"southeast","offset":1020},{"uri":"Subfamily","surface_form":"subfamily","offset":1076},{"uri":"Raninae","surface_form":"Raninae","offset":1086},{"uri":"True_frogs","surface_form":"true frogs","offset":1104},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":1135},{"uri":"Ranidae","surface_form":"Ranidae","offset":1142},{"uri":"New_Latin","surface_form":"New Latin","offset":1191},{"uri":"Subgenus","surface_form":"subgenus","offset":1297},{"uri":"Rana_(genus)","surface_form":"Rana","offset":1320},{"uri":"Junior_synonym","surface_form":"junior synonym","offset":1452},{"uri":"Sensu_stricto","surface_form":"sensu stricto","offset":1596},{"uri":"Abavorana","surface_form":"Abavorana","offset":1643},{"uri":"Amnirana","surface_form":"Amnirana","offset":1654},{"uri":"Chalcorana","surface_form":"Chalcorana","offset":1664},{"uri":"Humerana","surface_form":"Humerana","offset":1676},{"uri":"Indosylvirana","surface_form":"Indosylvirana","offset":1699},{"uri":"Papurana","surface_form":"Papurana","offset":1714},{"uri":"Pulchrana","surface_form":"Pulchrana","offset":1724},{"uri":"Sylvirana","surface_form":"Sylvirana","offset":1741}]}
