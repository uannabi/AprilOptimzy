{"id":807270,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_United_States_heat_wave","text":"e=\"preserve\">The 1980 United States heat wave was a period of strong heat and drought. It caused \"serious\" havoc and damage in the Southern Great Plains and much of the Midwestern United States during the summer of 1980. It was one of the most devastating and damaging natural disasters in terms of deaths.\nThe heat wave first got started in June 1980. A strong high pressure area began building in the central and Southern United States. That allowed the temperatures to soar to 90\u00B0F almost every day from June to September. This high pressure system acted as a cap on the atmosphere. That prevented thunderstorm development and caused severe drought conditions. But the heat wave broke when the dying Hurricane Allen stopped the weather pattern.\nThe heat wave and drought led a number of cities in the Midwest and South to have record heat. In Kansas City, Missouri, the high temperature was only below 90\u00B0F twice. In the same city, the high temperature hit 100\u00B0F 17 days in a row. In Memphis, Tennessee, the high temperature reached 108\u00B0F on Sunday, July 13. It was part of a 15-day stretch of 100\u00B0F temperatures that lasted from July 6 to July 20.\nThe agricultural damage by the 1980 heat wave and drought was over $20 billion (1980 USD). That allowed the temperatures to soar to 90\u00B0F almost every day from June to September. This high pressure system acted as a cap on the atmosphere.\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, high temperatures exceeded 100\u00B0F a total of 69 times. Forty-two of those were consecutive days. In Dallas-Fort Worth, the high temperature hit 113\u00B0F on two days: June 26 and 27.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Heat_wave","surface_form":"strong heat","offset":62},{"uri":"Drought","surface_form":"drought","offset":78},{"uri":"Great_Plains","surface_form":"Great Plains","offset":140},{"uri":"Midwestern_United_States","surface_form":"Midwestern United States","offset":169},{"uri":"Natural_disaster","surface_form":"natural disaster","offset":269},{"uri":"High_pressure_area","surface_form":"high pressure area","offset":362},{"uri":"Southern_United_States","surface_form":"Southern United States","offset":415},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":574},{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"thunderstorm","offset":601},{"uri":"Hurricane_Allen","surface_form":"Hurricane Allen","offset":703},{"uri":"Kansas_City%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Kansas City, Missouri","offset":846},{"uri":"Memphis%2C_Tennessee","surface_form":"Memphis, Tennessee","offset":987},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":1156},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":1378},{"uri":"Dallas","surface_form":"Dallas","offset":1393},{"uri":"Fort_Worth","surface_form":"Fort Worth","offset":1400}]}
