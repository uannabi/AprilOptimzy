{"id":80743,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_Coast_State_Beach","text":"Sonoma Coast State Beach is a series of beaches in Sonoma County, California. The beaches are protected as the Sonoma Coast State Park. It extends for about along the Pacific Coast, from Bodega Head in Bodega to just north of Goat Rock Beach.\nThe nearest town is Jenner. The coastline consists of a number of named beaches, including Arched Rock Beach, Jenner Beach, Blind Beach, Goat Beach and Goat Rock Beach. Goat Beach is known for being one of the most dangerous surfing spots in California because of its powerful waves, and it is recommended to not go near the water when visiting the beach. Jenner Beach got attention in August 2004 when two Christian youth camp counselors, 22-year-old Lindsay Cutshall and 26-year-old Jason Allen, were found dead. Both had been shot in the head at close range. The murders have not been solved.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":40},{"uri":"Sonoma_County%2C_California","surface_form":"Sonoma County","offset":51},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":66},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Coast","offset":167},{"uri":"Goat_Rock_Beach","surface_form":"Goat Rock Beach","offset":226},{"uri":"Jenner%2C_California","surface_form":"Jenner","offset":263},{"uri":"Surfing","surface_form":"surfing","offset":468},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christian","offset":650},{"uri":"Counselor","surface_form":"counselor","offset":671},{"uri":"Gun","surface_form":"shot","offset":772},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":809}]}
