She has all the qualities needed to become a great Fairy Godmother: she is brave, impetuous, she has a great heart and plenty of energy to get her hands dirty and help others. However, Manu thinks he already knows everything. Her excitement and anxiety is so great that she wants to take action right away. She runs over and ends up taking actions that only make the situation worse and then she has to double her efforts to correct her mistakes.\nJo\u00E3o - Jo\u00E3o is paranoid, afraid and scared. But his persecution mania is justified, after all, he has been the target of witches, stepmothers and giants countless times. He knows a lot about the Enchanted Kingdom. And, despite exaggerating the dangers and inflating the world's problems, it serves as a source of information in the daily life of SOS Fada Manu.\nDuke - Duke is the most rogue frog in the Kingdom! He invented his name and title to convince the world that he is a bewitched Prince. His speech makes him charming, with his cleverness and his soft words, he gets everything he wants. He has a hope that when Manu officially becomes the Fairy Godmother of the Kingdom, she will turn him into a handsome, easy-living prince.\nValqu\u00EDria - The Witch Valqu\u00EDria, like Manu, inherited her position in the Enchanted Kingdom from her grandmother. Her ambition has no limits: she wants to become the best witch of all time. In other words: she wants to be the worst witch of all time. His greatest joy is to cause fear in the inhabitants of the Kingdom. And his weakness is being extremely vain. It has thousands of creams and potions for skin and hair.\nGranny Olivia - Manu's grandmother. She is a retired and experienced fairy, who usually helps her granddaughter with some spell problems.\nAlfredo - Manu's father. He is a naive and clumsy man who is always in a good mood.
