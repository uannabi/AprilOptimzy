{"id":807550,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts_of_Australia","text":"The deserts of Australia cover, or 18% of the Australian mainland.\nHowever, about 35% of Australia gets so little rain it is actually a desert. The deserts in Australia are mainly in the western plateau and interior lowlands of the country.\nBy international standards, Australian deserts receive relatively high rates of rainfall. They are not necessarily devoid of vegetation: they have large areas where vegetation is very limited in height or extent.\nRainfall is mainly in the North and East of the country (especially the Daintree Rainforest), with some in the southern area. Almost all rain falls on the edges of the huge island, not in the centre.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":89},{"uri":"Desert","surface_form":"desert","offset":148},{"uri":"Western_Plateau","surface_form":"western plateau","offset":187},{"uri":"Daintree_Rainforest","surface_form":"Daintree Rainforest","offset":526}]}
