{"id":80760,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euporie_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Euporie or is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.\nEuporie is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 19,088,000\u00A0km in 538.780 days, at an inclination of 145\u00B0 to the ecliptic (145\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.0960.\nIt was named in August 2003 after Euporie, a Greek goddess of abundance and one of the Horae in Greek mythology (and thus a daughter of Zeus).\nIt is the closest member of the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000\u00A0km, at inclinations of about 150\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":29},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":37},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":93},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
