It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.\nAutonoe is about 4\u00A0kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,264,000\u00A0km in 772.168 days, at an inclination of 151\u00B0 to the ecliptic (150\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.369.\nIt belongs to the Pasipha\u00EB group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0.\nAutonoe was named in August 2003 after the Greek mythological figure Autonoe, conquest of Zeus (Jupiter), mother of the Charites (Gracies), according to some authors.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":30},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":38},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":94},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
