It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001. It was given the designation.\nEuanthe is about 3 kilometres in diameter. It orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,465,000 km in 598.093 days. This orbit is at an inclination of 143\u00B0 to the ecliptic (142\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator) with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2001.\nIt was named in August 2003 after Euanthe, who was the mother of the Graces, according to some Greek writers.\nEuanthe is in the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000\u00A0km, at inclinations of about 150\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":24},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":105},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
