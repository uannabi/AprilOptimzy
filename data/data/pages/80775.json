{"id":80775,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaclite_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Megaclite or, is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the designation.\nMegaclite is about 5.4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,687,000\u00A0km in 792.437 days, at an inclination of 150\u00B0 to the ecliptic (148\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.308.\nIt was named in October 2002 after Megaclite, mother by Zeus (Jupiter) of Thebe and Locrus (although both of these are assigned a different father by other authors).\nIt belongs to the Pasipha\u00EB group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":32},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":40},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":75},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":96},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
