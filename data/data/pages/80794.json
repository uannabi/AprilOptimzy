{"id":80794,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyllene_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cyllene or, is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, getting the designation.\nCyllene is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,396,000\u00A0km in 731.099 days, at an inclination of 140\u00B0 to the ecliptic (140\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.4116.\nIt was named in March 2005 after Cyllene, a naiad (stream nymph) or oread (mountain nymph) associated with Mount Kyllini, Greece. She was a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter).\nIt belongs to the Pasipha\u00EB group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"List_of_Jupiter%27s_moons","surface_form":"moon","offset":30},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":38},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":94},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
