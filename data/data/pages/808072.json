It is caused by low amounts of blood and/or fluid inside the human body to let the heart pump enough blood to the body.\nHypovolemic shock happens when there is a low amount of intravascular volume to the point of heart failure. The hypovolemic shock could be due to severe dehydration or from blood loss.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Medical_emergency","surface_form":"medical emergency","offset":36},{"uri":"Hypovolemia","surface_form":"hypovolemia","offset":78},{"uri":"Extracellular_fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":135},{"uri":"Intravascular_volume","surface_form":"intravascular volume","offset":267},{"uri":"Heart_failure","surface_form":"heart failure","offset":304},{"uri":"Dehydration","surface_form":"dehydration","offset":364},{"uri":"Hemorrhage","surface_form":"blood loss","offset":384}]}
