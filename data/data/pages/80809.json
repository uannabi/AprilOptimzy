{"id":80809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre","text":"e=\"preserve\">A fibre, which can also be spelled fiber is a piece of material which is long, thin and flexible, like a length of thread. Plant fibres are the basis of fabric such as cotton. Silk and wool fibres come from animals. In the 20th century many artificial fibres were invented like nylon and polyester.\nThey are very important in the structure of plants and animals, because they hold tissues together.\nThere are many uses for fibres. They can be spun together into filaments, thread, string or rope. They can be woven in fabric or in composite materials\nMan-made fiber.\nMan-made are fibers that are changed by man. Man-made fibers consist of regenerated fibers and synthetic fibers.\nSemi-synthetic fiber.\nSemi-synthetic fibers are made from raw materials with natural long-chain polymer structures. They are only changed and partially degraded by chemical processes. The first semi-synthetic fiber is rayon. Most semi-synthetic fibers are cellulose regenerated fibers.\nCellulose regenerated fibers.\nCellulose fibers are a type of man-made fibers, regenerated from natural cellulose. The cellulose comes from many sources: rayon comes from tree wood fiber, bamboo fiber comes from bamboo, seacell comes from seaweed, etc.\nSynthetic fiber.\nSynthetic fibers come from synthetic materials such as petrochemicals.\nMetallic fibers.\nMetallic fibers can be gotten from ductile metals such as copper, gold or silver and extruded or deposited from more brittle ones, such as nickel, aluminum or iron.\nCarbon fiber.\nCarbon fibers are fibers that are mostly made up of carbon atoms. Carbon fibers are often based on oxidizing carbonized polymers through pyrolysis like PAN.\nSilicon carbide fiber.\nIn silicon carbide fibers the basic polymers are not hydrocarbons but polymers. About 50% of the carbon atoms are replaced by silicon atoms.\nFiberglass.\nFiberglass are also man-made fibers that come from natural raw materials. It is made from a specific type glass, and optical fiber, which is made from purified natural quartz.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Yarn","surface_form":"thread","offset":128},{"uri":"Fabric","surface_form":"fabric","offset":166},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":181},{"uri":"Silk","surface_form":"Silk","offset":189},{"uri":"Wool","surface_form":"wool","offset":198},{"uri":"Invention","surface_form":"invented","offset":277},{"uri":"Nylon","surface_form":"nylon","offset":291},{"uri":"Polyester","surface_form":"polyester","offset":301},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":356},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":367},{"uri":"Tissue_(biological)","surface_form":"tissues","offset":394},{"uri":"Spindle_(textiles)","surface_form":"spun together","offset":456},{"uri":"Filament","surface_form":"filament","offset":475},{"uri":"Yarn","surface_form":"thread","offset":486},{"uri":"Twine","surface_form":"string","offset":494},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":504},{"uri":"Woven","surface_form":"woven","offset":522},{"uri":"Fabric","surface_form":"fabric","offset":531},{"uri":"Composite_material","surface_form":"composite material","offset":544},{"uri":"Raw_material","surface_form":"raw materials","offset":751},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":789},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structures","offset":797},{"uri":"Degradation","surface_form":"degraded","offset":845},{"uri":"Rayon","surface_form":"rayon","offset":911},{"uri":"Cellulose_regenerated_fiber","surface_form":"cellulose regenerated fibers","offset":949},{"uri":"Cellulose_fiber","surface_form":"Cellulose fibers","offset":1009},{"uri":"Cellulose","surface_form":"cellulose","offset":1082},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":1149},{"uri":"Wood_fibre","surface_form":"wood fiber","offset":1154},{"uri":"Bamboo_fiber","surface_form":"bamboo fiber","offset":1166},{"uri":"Bamboo","surface_form":"bamboo","offset":1190},{"uri":"Seacell","surface_form":"seacell","offset":1198},{"uri":"Seaweed","surface_form":"seaweed","offset":1217},{"uri":"Petrochemical","surface_form":"petrochemicals","offset":1303},{"uri":"Ductile","surface_form":"ductile","offset":1371},{"uri":"Metal","surface_form":"metals","offset":1379},{"uri":"Copper","surface_form":"copper","offset":1394},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":1402},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":1410},{"uri":"Extrusion","surface_form":"extruded","offset":1421},{"uri":"Deposition","surface_form":"deposited","offset":1433},{"uri":"Nickel","surface_form":"nickel","offset":1475},{"uri":"Aluminium","surface_form":"aluminum","offset":1483},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":1495},{"uri":"Carbon_fiber","surface_form":"Carbon fibers","offset":1515},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":1567},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atoms","offset":1574},{"uri":"Oxidized","surface_form":"oxidizing","offset":1614},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymers","offset":1635},{"uri":"Pyrolysis","surface_form":"pyrolysis","offset":1652},{"uri":"Polyacrylonitrile","surface_form":"PAN","offset":1667},{"uri":"Silicon_carbide","surface_form":"silicon carbide","offset":1698},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymers","offset":1731},{"uri":"Hydrocarbon","surface_form":"hydrocarbons","offset":1748},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":1792},{"uri":"Silicon","surface_form":"silicon","offset":1821},{"uri":"Fiberglass","surface_form":"Fiberglass","offset":1848},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":1954},{"uri":"Optical_fiber","surface_form":"optical fiber","offset":1965},{"uri":"Quartz","surface_form":"quartz","offset":2016}]}
