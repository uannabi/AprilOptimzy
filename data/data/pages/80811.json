{"id":80811,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibreglass","text":"Fibreglass (US: fiberglass) is a composite material. It is a fibre-reinforced polymer made of a plastic reinforced by fine fibres made of glass. The composite material may be called glass-reinforced plastic (GRP).\nFibreglass is cheaper and more flexible than carbon fibre. It is stronger than many metals (when compared by weight), and can be moulded into complex shapes. The plastic matrix is usually a thermoset polymer \u2013 such as epoxy or polyester resin, or it may be a thermoplastic.\nUse of the term.\n\"Fiberglass\" refers to the \"complete glass fiber reinforced composite material\", rather than just the glass fibre inside it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Composite_material","surface_form":"composite material","offset":33},{"uri":"Fiber-reinforced_polymer","surface_form":"fibre-reinforced polymer","offset":61},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":96},{"uri":"Fibre","surface_form":"fibre","offset":123},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":138},{"uri":"Flexibility","surface_form":"flexible","offset":245},{"uri":"Carbon_fibre","surface_form":"carbon fibre","offset":259},{"uri":"Moulding","surface_form":"moulded","offset":343},{"uri":"Thermoset","surface_form":"thermoset","offset":404},{"uri":"Epoxy","surface_form":"epoxy","offset":432},{"uri":"Polyester","surface_form":"polyester","offset":441},{"uri":"Thermoplastic","surface_form":"thermoplastic","offset":473}]}
