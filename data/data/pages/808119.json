{"id":808119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk_Junction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hawk Junction is a community with a local services board in the Canadian province of Ontario, found just north of Highway 101, about east of Wawa.\nThe community was made by people of Italian, Scottish and French ancestry in 1909 when the Algoma Central Railway was made through the area. In 1923-1924 it was destroyed by fire. The community was rebuilt and is now a terminal for the Algoma Central Railway.\nIn September 2017, the last business, the Big Bear Hotel closed, leaving Hawk Junction without any services. Residents had needed to drive to the town of Wawa for any services. It is a popular starting point for wilderness hunting and fishing trips. During the winter Hawk Junction is a major snowmobile drop off point. The Big Bear has now recently reopened its doors under a new owner.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Local_services_board_(Ontario)","surface_form":"local services board","offset":49},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":77},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":98},{"uri":"Ontario_Highway_101","surface_form":"Highway 101","offset":127},{"uri":"Wawa%2C_Ontario","surface_form":"Wawa","offset":154},{"uri":"Ancestor","surface_form":"ancestry","offset":225},{"uri":"Algoma_Central_Railway","surface_form":"Algoma Central Railway","offset":251},{"uri":"Fire","surface_form":"fire","offset":334},{"uri":"Snowmobile","surface_form":"snowmobile","offset":713}]}
