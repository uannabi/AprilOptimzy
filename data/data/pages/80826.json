{"id":80826,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Manrique","text":"Jorge Manrique (c. 1440 \u2013 1479) was a major Spanish poet, whose main work, the \"Coplas a la muerte de su padre (Stanzas about the Death of his Father)\", is still read today. He was a supporter of the great Spanish queen, Isabel I of Castile, and actively participated on her side in the civil war that broke out against her half-brother, Enrique IV, when the latter attempted to make his daughter, Juana, crown princess. Jorge died in 1479 during an attempt to take the castle of Garcimu\u00F1oz after Isabel gained the crown.\nManrique were one of major Spanish aristocratic families of the Jewish converso descent. See, Norman Roth, \"Conversos, Inquisition, and the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain\", Madison, WI: The University of Wisconcin Press, 1995, p.\u00A0333. Jorge Manrique was a great-nephew of I\u00F1igo L\u00F3pez de Mendoza (marquess of Santillana), a descendant of Pero L\u00F3pez de Ayala, chancellor of Castile, and a nephew of G\u00F3mez Manrique, \"corregidor\" of Toledo, all important poets of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He was, therefore, a member of a noble family of great consequence.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1440","surface_form":"1440","offset":19},{"uri":"1479","surface_form":"1479","offset":26},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":44},{"uri":"Isabel_I_of_Castile","surface_form":"Isabel I of Castile","offset":221},{"uri":"Enrique_IV","surface_form":"Enrique IV","offset":338},{"uri":"I%C3%B1igo_L%C3%B3pez_de_Mendoza","surface_form":"I\u00F1igo L\u00F3pez de Mendoza","offset":796},{"uri":"Pero_L%C3%B3pez_de_Ayala","surface_form":"Pero L\u00F3pez de Ayala","offset":861},{"uri":"G%C3%B3mez_Manrique","surface_form":"G\u00F3mez Manrique","offset":921}]}
