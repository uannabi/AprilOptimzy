{"id":808323,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydipsia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek \u03C0\u03BF\u03BB\u03C5\u03B4\u03AF\u03C8\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2 (\"polud\u00EDpsios\") \"very thirsty\", which is gotten from \u03C0\u03BF\u03BB\u03CD\u03C2 (\"pol\u00FAs\", \"much, many\") + \u03B4\u03AF\u03C8\u03B1 (\"d\u00EDpsa\", \"thirst\"). Polydipsia is a symptom in many diseases. It also occurs as a weird behaviour in some animals, such as in birds.\nDiabetes.\nPolydipsia can be a symptom of diabetes mellitus. It is seen in cases of poorly controlled diabetes. Diabetes insipidus can also cause polydipsia.\nOther physiological causes.\nIt can also be caused by a change in the osmolality of the extracellular fluids of the body, hypokalemia, decreased blood volume, and other conditions that create water deficiency.\nDiagnosis.\nPolydipsia is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Polydipsia investigations at diagnosing diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thirst","surface_form":"thirst","offset":37},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":234},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"diseases","offset":250},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animals","offset":304},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"birds","offset":324},{"uri":"Diabetes_mellitus","surface_form":"diabetes mellitus","offset":372},{"uri":"Diabetes_insipidus","surface_form":"Diabetes insipidus","offset":442},{"uri":"Osmolality","surface_form":"osmolality","offset":557},{"uri":"Extracellular_fluid","surface_form":"extracellular fluids","offset":575},{"uri":"Hypokalemia","surface_form":"hypokalemia","offset":609},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":632},{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":742},{"uri":"Diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnosing","offset":790}]}
