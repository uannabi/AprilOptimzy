{"id":80842,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelxinoe_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Thelxinoe or is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2004 from pictures taken in 2003, and originally got the designation.\nThelxinoe is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,454,000\u00A0km in 597.607 days, at an inclination of 151\u00B0 to the ecliptic (153\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2685.\nIt was named in March 2005 after Thelxinoe, one of the four original Muses according to some Greek writers, and a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter) by Mnemosyne.\nThelxinoe belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000\u00A0km, at inclinations of about 150\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":31},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":39},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":95},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
