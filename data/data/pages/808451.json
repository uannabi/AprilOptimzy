{"id":808451,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouse","text":"e=\"preserve\">Scouse (; sometimes called Liverpool English or Merseyside English) is an accent and dialect of English beginning in the northwest county of Merseyside. It originated mostly from Irish (from the The Irish Potato Famine) and Welsh immigrants. he Scouse accent is very noticeable and is not similar with those of the neighbouring regions. The accent is named after the stew scouse, which Liverpudlians eat alot. Liverpool's accent is often thought to be informal, like most of the \"Northern\" English accents.\nThe accent can now be found in areas close to Liverpool, like Widnes and Runcorn, because Liverpool was developed a lot in the 1950s. A lot of different types of the accent exist, for example, the Northern accent, which is different from the southern accent.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Accent_(dialect)","surface_form":"accent","offset":87},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":98},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":109},{"uri":"North_West_England","surface_form":"northwest","offset":134},{"uri":"Merseyside","surface_form":"Merseyside","offset":154},{"uri":"Irish_Potato_Famine","surface_form":"The Irish Potato Famine)","offset":208},{"uri":"Scouse","surface_form":"scouse","offset":385},{"uri":"Widnes","surface_form":"Widnes","offset":582},{"uri":"Runcorn","surface_form":"Runcorn","offset":593}]}
