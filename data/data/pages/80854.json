{"id":80854,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(periodic_table)","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A period in the periodic table is any horizontal row of elements.\nThe elements in a certain period all increase one by one in atomic numbers. The elements in the same period are very metallic on the left, and nonmetallic on the right. As you go across a period towards the right, the size of the atom gets larger, because protons and electrons are increasing.\nFirst period has 2 elements. Second period and third period each has 8 elements. Fourth period and fifth period each has 18 elements. And sixth period and seventh period each has 32 elements. Moreover, f-block elements are counted in the sixth and seventh periods. Hence, each one has 32 elements in it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":30},{"uri":"Horizontal","surface_form":"horizontal","offset":52},{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"element","offset":70},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":140}]}
