Her father was C\u00E9sar de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00F4me, legitimised son of King Henry IV of France and his official mistress Gabrielle d'Estr\u00E9es. Her mother was Princess Fran\u00E7oise of Lorraine (1592\u20131669), daughter and heiress of Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc\u0153ur, himself a rival of Henry IV. Her mother was the Duchess of Merc\u0153ur and Penthi\u00E8vre in her own right and was the greatest heiress of her time.\nStyled as \"Mademoiselle de Vend\u00F4me\" prior to marriage, she was the second of three children; she had two brothers, the Frondeur Fran\u00E7ois de Bourbon, Duke of Beaufort and Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00F4me whose wife Laura Mancini was a niece of Cardinal Mazarin. They were the parents of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, a very successful military commander and a Marshal of France.\nOn 11 July 1643 at the Louvre, \"Mademoiselle de Vend\u00F4me\" married Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours. The young prince was a member of a cadet branch of the house of Savoy which had settled in France. The young prince was a direct descendant of Philip II, Duke of Savoy as was \u00C9lisabeth. They had two daughters who would marry the heirs to the thrones of Savoy and Portugal, and three sons who died shortly after birth.\nIn 1652 the Duke of Nemours was killed by her brother Fran\u00E7ois, Duke of Beaufort in a duel. \u00C9lisabeth herself died in Paris. She managed to secure the income of the lands of Nemours for her two daughters, but the titles were inherited by other members of the family.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Henry_IV_of_France","surface_form":"King Henry IV of France","offset":72},{"uri":"C%C3%A9sar%2C_Duke_of_Vend%C3%B4me","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00F4me","offset":152},{"uri":"Gabrielle_d%27Estr%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Gabrielle d'Estr\u00E9es","offset":256},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7oise_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7oise of Lorraine","offset":301},{"uri":"Philippe_Emmanuel%2C_Duke_of_Merc%C5%93ur","surface_form":"Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc\u0153ur","offset":360},{"uri":"Counts_and_dukes_of_Penthi%C3%A8vre","surface_form":"Penthi\u00E8vre","offset":467},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Bourbon%2C_Duke_of_Beaufort","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois de Bourbon","offset":665},{"uri":"Duke_of_Beaufort","surface_form":"Duke of Beaufort","offset":686},{"uri":"Louis%2C_Duke_of_Vend%C3%B4me","surface_form":"Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00F4me","offset":707},{"uri":"Laura_Mancini","surface_form":"Laura Mancini","offset":752},{"uri":"Cardinal_Mazarin","surface_form":"Cardinal Mazarin","offset":781},{"uri":"Louis_Joseph%2C_Duke_of_Vend%C3%B4me","surface_form":"Louis Joseph de Bourbon","offset":824},{"uri":"Marshal_of_France","surface_form":"Marshal of France","offset":892},{"uri":"Louvre","surface_form":"Louvre","offset":934},{"uri":"Charles_Amadeus%2C_Duke_of_Nemours","surface_form":"Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours","offset":976},{"uri":"House_of_Savoy","surface_form":"house of Savoy","offset":1074},{"uri":"Philip_II%2C_Duke_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Philip II, Duke of Savoy","offset":1162},{"uri":"Fran%C3%A7ois%2C_Duke_of_Beaufort","surface_form":"Fran\u00E7ois, Duke of Beaufort","offset":1391},{"uri":"Duel","surface_form":"duel","offset":1423}]}
