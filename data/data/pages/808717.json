{"id":808717,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_of_Lorraine","text":"Fran\u00E7oise of Lorraine (November 1592 \u2013 8 September 1669) was a princess of Lorraine and daughter-in-law of Henry IV of France. Sometimes known as \"Fran\u00E7oise de Merc\u0153ur\", she belonged to the Merc\u0153ur cadet branch of the sovereign Dukes of Lorraine and was a niece of Louise of Lorraine, wife of the previous King Henry III. Fran\u00E7oise was the heiress of her father and, as such, was the Duchess of Merc\u0153ur and Penthi\u00E8vre \"suo jure\".\nBiography.\nFran\u00E7oise was the younger of two children. She was born in November 1592 with the exact date unknown; her only sibling, Philippe Louis, died in 1590 aged one making her the heiress to a large private fortune. During the reign of Henry III, her father had put himself at the head of the Catholic League in Brittany, and had himself proclaimed protector of the Roman Catholic Church in the province in 1588. Invoking the hereditary rights of his wife, who was a descendant of the Dukes of Brittany, he endeavoured to make himself independent in that province, and organised a government at Nantes, calling his son \"prince and duke of Brittany\".\nWith the aid of the Spaniards he defeated Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier, whom Henry IV of France had sent against him, at Craon in 1592. The king marched against Meroeur in person. As part of their peace they drew up a marriage contract in 1596 whereby his daughter, would marry Henry's legitimised son.\nThe French and Spanish then signed the Peace of Vervins on 2 May 1598 when Fran\u00E7oise was 6; part of the treaty again stipulated that the young Fran\u00E7oise would be engaged to the illegitimate child of Henry IV, C\u00E9sar de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00F4me. Vend\u00F4me was the eldest child of the King and his mistress Gabrielle d'Estr\u00E9es.\nThe wedding took place at the palace of Fontainebleau on 16 July 1609. The bride was 16, the groom 15. The couple had three children and were the paternal grandparents of \"le Grand Vend\u00F4me\". Due to the marriage contract, C\u00E9sar acquired the right to manage her lands. Her husband died disgraced in 1665, having been involved in the Fronde and having been accused of trying to poison Cardinal Richelieu. In the same year she went to Savoy with her granddaughter Marie Jeanne of Savoy, who wed Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy on 20 May 1665. The duchies of Merc\u0153ur and Penthi\u00E8vre were inherited by her eldest son. Fran\u00E7oise died in Paris in 1669 aged 77 and was buried there. Other fiefs that Fran\u00E7oise owned were the princedom of Martigues, the duchy of \u00C9tampes and the seigneurie of Ancenis.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["royalty"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Henry_IV_of_France","surface_form":"Henry IV of France","offset":107},{"uri":"Cadet_branch","surface_form":"cadet branch","offset":198},{"uri":"Duke_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Dukes of Lorraine","offset":228},{"uri":"Louise_of_Lorraine","surface_form":"Louise of Lorraine","offset":265},{"uri":"Henry_III_of_France","surface_form":"King Henry III","offset":306},{"uri":"Duke_of_Mercoeur","surface_form":"Merc\u0153ur","offset":395},{"uri":"Counts_and_dukes_of_Penthi%C3%A8vre","surface_form":"Penthi\u00E8vre","offset":407},{"uri":"Suo_jure","surface_form":"suo jure","offset":419},{"uri":"Catholic_League_(French)","surface_form":"Catholic League","offset":727},{"uri":"Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Catholic Church","offset":806},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Brittany","surface_form":"Dukes of Brittany","offset":919},{"uri":"Henri%2C_Duke_of_Montpensier","surface_form":"Henri de Bourbon","offset":1126},{"uri":"Meurthe-et-Moselle","surface_form":"Craon","offset":1214},{"uri":"Peace_of_Vervins","surface_form":"Peace of Vervins","offset":1435},{"uri":"C%C3%A9sar%2C_Duke_of_Vend%C3%B4me","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00F4me","offset":1605},{"uri":"Gabrielle_d%27Estr%C3%A9es","surface_form":"Gabrielle d'Estr\u00E9es","offset":1698},{"uri":"Palace_of_Fontainebleau","surface_form":"palace of Fontainebleau","offset":1749},{"uri":"Louis_Joseph%2C_Duke_of_Vend%C3%B4me","surface_form":"le Grand Vend\u00F4me","offset":1891},{"uri":"Fronde","surface_form":"Fronde","offset":2050},{"uri":"Cardinal_Richelieu","surface_form":"Cardinal Richelieu","offset":2101},{"uri":"Savoy","surface_form":"Savoy","offset":2150},{"uri":"Marie_Jeanne_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Marie Jeanne of Savoy","offset":2179},{"uri":"Charles_Emmanuel_II%2C_Duke_of_Savoy","surface_form":"Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy","offset":2210},{"uri":"Fief","surface_form":"fief","offset":2401},{"uri":"Duke_of_%C3%89tampes","surface_form":"duchy of \u00C9tampes","offset":2465},{"uri":"Ancenis","surface_form":"seigneurie of Ancenis","offset":2490}]}
