{"id":80873,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire","text":"=\"preserve\">A billionaire is somebody who has at least one billion units of currency (for example, British pounds \u00A3 or American dollars $). It is not clear how much a billion is. In Europe a billion is one\u00A0million\u00A0million (1,000,000,000,000) with 12 zeros. However, in the United States a billion is one\u00A0thousand\u00A0million (1,000,000,000) with 9 zeros. Some people in the United Kingdom, especially banks, also use the American way.\n\"Milliard\" is used for 1,000,000,000 in countries that use one million million for billion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Currency","surface_form":"currency","offset":76},{"uri":"Pound_sterling","surface_form":"British pounds","offset":99},{"uri":"United_States_Dollar","surface_form":"American dollars","offset":119},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":182},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":273},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":370},{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"banks","offset":397}]}
