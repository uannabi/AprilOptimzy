It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.\nPasithee is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,307,000 km in 726.933 days, at an inclination of 166\u00B0 to the ecliptic (164\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.3289.\nIt was named in August 2003 after Pasithee, one of the Charites, goddesses of charm, beauty, nature, human creativity and fertility, daughters of Zeus (Jupiter) by Eurynome. Pasithee, better known as Aglaea, is the spouse of Hypnos (Sleep) and presides to hallucinations and hallucinogens.\nIt belongs to the Carme group, made up of non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000 km and at an inclination of about 165\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":22},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":40},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":96},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
