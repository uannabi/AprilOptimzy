{"id":808925,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_the_Super_Smash_Bros._series","text":"The fighting game series \"Super Smash Bros.\" from Nintendo was started in 1999. It features many video game characters from different series. There are over 80 playable characters across the series. Most of these are from series owned by Nintendo, but there are also some third-party ones as well. There are also other non-player characters, such as enemies, bosses, and power-ups.\nPlayable characters.\nEach game in the series has a number of playable characters called \"fighters\". These characters are mostly from Nintendo series. There are currently 85 fighters in the entire series. Starting with \"Super Smash Bros.Brawl\", characters from non-Nintendo series started being added. There will also be 3 more in \"Ultimate\", but they haven't been added yet. At the start of each game, some of the fighters will be hidden. To unlock a hidden fighter, players need to reach certain goals and then defeat that fighter in a match.\nIn \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\" and \"Super Smash Bros.Ultimate\", players can make their own Mii Fighters. Mii Fighters have costumes which can be unlocked or bought as downloadable content. Many of these costumes are based on characters and series which do not have playable characters, such as Heihachi Mishima from \"Tekken\", Sans from \"Undertale\", Cuphead from \"Cuphead\", Vault Boy from \"Fallout\" and Travis Touchdown from \"No More Heroes\". All games have fighters that share a lot of moves and properties with other characters, but with some small differences. In \"Ultimate\", these characters are called \"Echo Fighters\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fighting_game","surface_form":"fighting game","offset":4},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._(series)","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.","offset":26},{"uri":"Nintendo","surface_form":"Nintendo","offset":50},{"uri":"Non-player_character","surface_form":"non-player characters","offset":319},{"uri":"Boss_(video_gaming)","surface_form":"bosses","offset":359},{"uri":"Power-up","surface_form":"power-ups","offset":371},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.Brawl","offset":601},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._for_Nintendo_3DS_and_Wii_U","surface_form":"\"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\"","offset":929},{"uri":"Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate","surface_form":"Super Smash Bros.Ultimate","offset":983},{"uri":"Mii","surface_form":"Mii","offset":1038},{"uri":"Downloadable_content","surface_form":"downloadable content","offset":1114},{"uri":"Tekken_(series)","surface_form":"Tekken","offset":1264},{"uri":"Undertale","surface_form":"Undertale","offset":1284},{"uri":"Cuphead","surface_form":"Cuphead","offset":1310},{"uri":"Fallout_(series)","surface_form":"Vault Boy","offset":1320},{"uri":"Fallout_(series)","surface_form":"Fallout","offset":1336}]}
