{"id":808959,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(geometry)","text":"In geometry, dilation (also called homothety or homothetic transformation) is the process which changes the size of a figure without changing its shape, a type of transformation. Any figure and its image after dilation are similar to each other.\nDilation is defined by a point V, the center of dilation, and a number k, the ratio. Given a point P in the plane, its image P' (\"P prime\") is on the line VP. The distance from P' to V is k times the distance from P to V.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":3},{"uri":"Size","surface_form":"size","offset":108},{"uri":"Shape","surface_form":"shape","offset":146},{"uri":"Transformation","surface_form":"transformation","offset":163},{"uri":"Similarity_(geometry)","surface_form":"similar","offset":223},{"uri":"Ratio","surface_form":"ratio","offset":324},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":354},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":396},{"uri":"Distance","surface_form":"distance","offset":409}]}
