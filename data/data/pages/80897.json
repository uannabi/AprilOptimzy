It was found by Spacewatch on October 6, 1999 and originally designated as an asteroid (). It was found to be in orbit around Jupiter by Tim Spahr on July 18, 2000, and then given the designation.\nCallirrhoe is about 8.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,356,000\u00A0km in 776.543 days, at an inclination of 141\u00B0 to the ecliptic (140\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.264.\nIt was named in October 2002 after Callirhoe, daughter of the river god Achelous, one of Zeus' (Jupiter's) many conquests.\nIt belongs to the Pasipha\u00EB group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0.\nAs a navigation exercise, the New Horizons spacecraft imaged it on January 10, 2007.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":38},{"uri":"List_of_Jupiter%27s_moons","surface_form":"moons","offset":63},{"uri":"Spacewatch","surface_form":"Spacewatch","offset":86},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":148},{"uri":"Timothy_B._Spahr","surface_form":"Tim Spahr","offset":207},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":397},{"uri":"Ecliptic","surface_form":"ecliptic","offset":424},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"orbital eccentricity","offset":470},{"uri":"Callirhoe","surface_form":"Callirhoe","offset":536},{"uri":"Achelous","surface_form":"Achelous","offset":573},{"uri":"Zeus","surface_form":"Zeus","offset":590},{"uri":"Pasipha%C3%AB_group","surface_form":"Pasipha\u00EB group","offset":642},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":662},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":774},{"uri":"New_Horizons","surface_form":"New Horizons","offset":852}]}
