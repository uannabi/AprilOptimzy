{"id":80908,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_Coefficient","text":"=\"preserve\">The lift coefficient (\"CL\" or \"CZ\") is coefficient without a dimension that relates the lift generated by an airfoil, the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around the airfoil, and the planform area of the airfoil. It may also be described as the ratio of lift pressure to dynamic pressure.\nThe lift coefficient is a dimensionless number.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coefficient","surface_form":"coefficient","offset":51},{"uri":"Dimension","surface_form":"dimension","offset":73},{"uri":"Relate","surface_form":"relates","offset":88},{"uri":"Lift_(force)","surface_form":"lift","offset":100},{"uri":"Airfoil","surface_form":"airfoil","offset":121},{"uri":"Dynamic_pressure","surface_form":"dynamic pressure","offset":134},{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":158},{"uri":"Flux","surface_form":"flow","offset":164},{"uri":"Planform","surface_form":"planform","offset":197},{"uri":"Dimensionless_quantity","surface_form":"dimensionless number","offset":329}]}
