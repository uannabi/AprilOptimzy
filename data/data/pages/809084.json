{"id":809084,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Mauss","text":"e=\"preserve\">Marcel Mauss (May 10, 1872- February 10, 1950) was a French anthropologist and sociologist. He was also the nephew of another famous anthropologist, \u00C9mile Durkheim. Mauss is known for his work on gifts and exchange, magic, sacrifice, the body, and comparing cultures. Mauss\u2019s most famous work is \"The Gift\". \"The Gift\" is about the ways gifts and exchanges build relationships. Mauss is also known for influencing structural anthropologists such as Claude L\u00E9vi-Strauss.\nBackground and Education.\nMarcel Mauss was born in \u00C9pinal, France in 1872. His parents were Gerson Mauss and Rosine (Durkheim) Mauss. He was raised in a non-observant Jewish family.\nIn the early 1890s, Mauss went to the University of Bordeaux where he studied many subjects including religion and philosophy. Later he moved to Paris, France where he studied at the \u00C9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00C9tudes (an important French research school). In Paris, Mauss studied Sanskrit, Hebrew, history of religion, and other topics. Mauss eventually became a professor at \u00C9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00C9tudes. He taught about many different religions.\nDuring World War I, Mauss served in the French army as an interpreter.\nMauss helped form the Institut d'ethnologie (Ethnology Institute) at the University of Paris in 1925 with Paul Rivet and Lucien L\u00E9vy-Bruhl. He also was the chair of the sociology department at the Universit\u00E9 de Paris from 1931-1939.\nTamati Ranapiri.\nMauss\u2019s theories about the role of gifts in M\u0101ori culture relied heavily on the information provided by Tamati Ranapiri. Ranapiri was a M\u0101ori scholar who exchanged letters with ethnographer Elsdon Best. Through these letters, Ranapiri explained how gifts were used to connect people in M\u0101ori society. According to Ranapiri, gifts created commitment without force. These commitments created by gifts made social relationships and bonds stronger.\nElsdon Best.\nElsdon Best was an enthographer who studied the M\u0101ori people of New Zealand. Mauss used Best\u2019s letters and primary data to write his work about M\u0101ori gift giving.\n\u00C9mile Durkheim.\n\u00C9mile Durkheim was Marcel Mauss\u2019s uncle as well as a professional influence. The two worked together on many projects. Durkheim and Mauss worked together to publish the book \"Primitive Classifications\". This book was a response to Immanuel Kant\u2019s categories of understanding. Durkheim and Mauss also worked together to publish articles in \"L\u2019Ann\u00E9e Sociologique\". \"L\u2019Ann\u00E9e Sociologique\" was a sociology journal created by Durkheim.\n\"The Gift\".\n\"The Gift\" was published in 1925. It was written partially in response to the Bolshevik Revolution. In this book, Mauss argued that every society has both markets and money of some kind as well as altruism. Mauss claims that gifts are a \u201Ctotal social fact\u201D which have spiritual parts to them. \"The Gift\" also examines gift giving traditions of some indigenous peoples. Mauss writes about the M\u0101ori idea of \u201CHau.\" He also talks about Potlatch, which was first practiced by indigenous groups in North America. Mauss believed that gift giving can tell us a lot about social relationships. He also believed that gift giving was connected to power. Mauss claimed that there is no such thing as a free gift. He thought every gift was part of an ongoing system of giving and receiving.\nSacrifice and The Body.\nMauss saw sacrifice as a system of exchange as well. In 1899, Mauss published \"Sacrifice: Its Nature and Functions\" with Henri Hubert. This book compares many religious practices with a focus on sacrifice and the body. Mauss and Hubert compared religions from many places and time periods. They describe sacrifice as a system which involves both actions that are aimed towards a holy person or object and actions that are aimed away from a holy person or object. Mauss and Hubert claimed that the body is the result of many different habits and qualities. They claimed that a person is made up of certain actions that are performed through specific behaviors.\nMagic.\nMauss teamed up with Hubert again in 1902 to publish \"A General Theory of Magic\". In this book, Mauss and Hubert claimed that social events, rather than individual people, were magic. This is another cross-cultural comparison, like Mauss and Hubert's work on sacrifice. They claim that magic is a social experience. The book examines the relationships between magic and religion, science, and technology. Mauss and Hubert also trace the long-lasting impact of magic on our modern ideas, such as the idea of good and bad luck.\nCritiques.\nIn 2017, Georgina Stewart published a criticism \"The Gift\", specifically on Mauss's understanding of Hau. Stewart claims that a misunderstanding of M\u0101ori beliefs about the cosmos and language differences caused Mauss to misunderstand the M\u0101ori concept of Hau. Alan Testart (1998) claimed that Mauss exaggerated the idea that all gifts need to pay repaid. Testart said that there were some truly free gifts, such as giving money to a homeless person as you walk by them. James Laidlaw also points out an example of free gifts in Jainism.\nImpacts.\nMauss is credited for being a major inspiration for Claude L\u00E9vi-Strauss. Claude L\u00E9vi-Strauss went on to develop the structuralist view of cultural anthropology. Mauss also inspired other structuralists such as Pierre Bourdieu. Mauss is also known for inspiring future work on topics such as exchange theory and economic anthropology. Mauss's cross-cultural comparisons were radical for his time, and he set the stage for the next generation of cultural anthropologists to use a similar comparative approach.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"%C3%89mile_Durkheim","surface_form":"\u00C9mile Durkheim","offset":162},{"uri":"Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss","surface_form":"Claude L\u00E9vi-Strauss","offset":462},{"uri":"Bordeaux","surface_form":"Bordeaux","offset":717},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":767},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":780},{"uri":"Paris%2C_France","surface_form":"Paris, France","offset":810},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":944},{"uri":"Hebrew","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":954},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":1123},{"uri":"Interpreter","surface_form":"interpreter","offset":1174},{"uri":"University_of_Paris","surface_form":"Universit\u00E9 de Paris","offset":1384},{"uri":"M%C4%81ori_people","surface_form":"M\u0101ori people","offset":1943},{"uri":"Immanuel_Kant","surface_form":"Immanuel Kant","offset":2305},{"uri":"Bolshevik_Revolution","surface_form":"Bolshevik Revolution","offset":2595},{"uri":"Altruism","surface_form":"altruism","offset":2714},{"uri":"Indigenous_peoples","surface_form":"indigenous peoples","offset":2866},{"uri":"Jainism","surface_form":"Jainism","offset":5052},{"uri":"Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss","surface_form":"Claude L\u00E9vi-Strauss","offset":5122}]}
