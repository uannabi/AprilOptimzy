{"id":80911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_D%C3%B6nitz","text":"Karl D\u00F6nitz () (16 September 1891 \u2013 24 December 1980) was a German naval leader. He commanded the German Navy (\"Kriegsmarine\") during the second half of World War II. D\u00F6nitz was also President of Germany for 23 days after Adolf Hitler's suicide. For his role in World War II, D\u00F6nitz was referred to as \"der L\u00F6we\" (the Lion).\nD\u00F6nitz was born in Berlin. He entered the Imperial German Navy (\"Kaiserliche Marine\") in 1911. During World War I, he served on surface ships. Later he was transferred to submarines (U-boats). He remained in the navy after the war and rose through the ranks of the German Navy of the Weimar Republic (\"Reichsmarine\") and the German Navy of the Third Reich (\"Kriegsmarine\"). He became a \"Gro\u00DFadmiral\". He served as Commander of Submarines (\"Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote\", \"B.d.U.\"). Later, he became Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy (\"Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine\"). He got this position, even though he never joined the Nazi Party. Under his command, the U-boat fleet fought the Battle of the Atlantic. He also served as \"Reichspr\u00E4sident\" for 23 days after Adolf Hitler's suicide. He ended the war as a prisoner-of-war of the British.\nAfter the war D\u00F6nitz was charged and convicted of \"crimes against peace\" and \"war crimes\" at the Nuremberg Trials. He served ten years in prison. He ordered the unrestricted submarine warfare which was done by Germany in the North Atlantic. With this, he caused Germany to be in breach of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.\nAt his trial, evidence was shown that the Allies had acted similarly. For this reason, this breach of international law had no impact on his sentence. After his release from prison, D\u00F6nitz moved to Aum\u00FChle, a small village near Hamburg. During his later years, he wrote two autobiographies. In them, he covered different periods in his life. He died of a heart attack on Christmas Eve, 1980.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":60},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":153},{"uri":"President_of_Germany","surface_form":"President of Germany","offset":183},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":344},{"uri":"Kaiserliche_Marine","surface_form":"Imperial German Navy","offset":367},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":427},{"uri":"Submarine","surface_form":"submarine","offset":496},{"uri":"U-boat","surface_form":"U-boat","offset":508},{"uri":"Military_rank","surface_form":"ranks","offset":577},{"uri":"Weimar_Republic","surface_form":"Weimar Republic","offset":609},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Third Reich","offset":669},{"uri":"Grand_Admiral","surface_form":"\"Gro\u00DFadmiral\"","offset":711},{"uri":"Nazi_Party","surface_form":"Nazi Party","offset":957},{"uri":"Second_Battle_of_the_Atlantic","surface_form":"Battle of the Atlantic","offset":1016},{"uri":"Reichspr%C3%A4sident","surface_form":"Reichspr\u00E4sident","offset":1059},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":1094},{"uri":"Prisoner-of-war","surface_form":"prisoner-of-war","offset":1140},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":1163},{"uri":"War_crimes","surface_form":"war crimes","offset":1250},{"uri":"Nuremberg_Trials","surface_form":"Nuremberg Trials","offset":1269},{"uri":"Unrestricted_submarine_warfare","surface_form":"unrestricted submarine warfare","offset":1333},{"uri":"North_Atlantic","surface_form":"North Atlantic","offset":1397},{"uri":"Second_London_Naval_Treaty","surface_form":"Second London Naval Treaty","offset":1465},{"uri":"Aum%C3%BChle","surface_form":"Aum\u00FChle","offset":1699},{"uri":"Hamburg","surface_form":"Hamburg","offset":1729},{"uri":"Myocardial_infarction","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1856},{"uri":"Christmas_Eve","surface_form":"Christmas Eve","offset":1872}]}
