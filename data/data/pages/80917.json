It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and given the designation.\nHelike is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,540,000\u00A0km in 601.402 Earth days, at an inclination of 155\u00B0 to the ecliptic (156\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.1375.\nIt was named in March 2005 after Helike, one of the nymphs that nurtured Zeus (Jupiter) in his infancy on Crete.\nHelike belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000\u00A0km, at inclinations of about 150\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":29},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":37},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":93},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
