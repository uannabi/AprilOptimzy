{"id":80924,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxidike_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Praxidike or, is a non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the designation.\nPraxidike orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,824,000\u00A0km in 613.904 days, at an inclination of 144\u00B0 to the ecliptic (143\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.1840.\nIt was named in August 2003 after Praxidike, the Greek goddess of punishment.\nPraxidike belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured asteroid. With an estimated diameter of 7\u00A0km, Praxidike is the second biggest member of the group after Ananke itself (assumed albedo of 0.04)\nThe moon appears grey similar to C-type asteroids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":36},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":54},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":89},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":110},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
