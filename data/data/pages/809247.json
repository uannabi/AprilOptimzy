Since there was no political freedom in Iran, every political organization and even small student circles had to go hiding and to organize underground.Komala was no exception. Like all other opposition organizations of that time, especially the leftist groups of the sixties and seventies, Komala faced severe repression.\nDuring those years many of Komala members and its leadership experienced persecution, torture and imprisonment in the hands of SAVAK, Shah\u2019s notorious secret police, but Komala could manage to survive and protect the main body of its organization and its growing network of activists. More than 9 years of hard and disciplined work prior to the outbreak of Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, bore its fruit and helped Komala build a strong and cohesive body of cadres among sections of Kurdish society. Komala managed to win over considerable sections of Kurdish students, teachers, intellectuals and young people and develop a significant influence and social base among workers and peasants throughout Kurdistan.\nKomala actively participated in the Iranian Revolution and in fact was behind almost every demonstration and popular movement of that period. On March 16, 1979, a few days after the victory of the Revolution, Komala launched an open political party. By this time Komala had already become a major political force in Iranian Kurdistan. The birth of Komala and its rapid growth among large sections of Kurdish society in Iran, apart from its own hard work, discipline and dedication, can be attributed to a combination of social factors during a period of Iran\u2019s transition from a traditional and patriarchal society to a so-called pseudo-modern one.\nIdeology.\nAfter a long and heated debate among it's ranks and in public during the 1990s, finally the majority of the Komala Party\u2019s cadres and members decided to a renewal programme to adapt to the new domestic and world developments.
