{"id":809294,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_Compostela","text":"SD Compostela is a football club which plays in Spain.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1928, Compostela spent the better part of that and the following decades playing professional football. On October 28, 1962, the newly formed SD Compostela merged with the Club Arenal. The decade of the 1970s was irregular. The team played in the Tercera Divisi\u00F3n, in the Regional category and in the new Segunda Divisi\u00F3n B. Its first promotion to a semi-national stage occurred in 1977, with a promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00F3n B (Group 1), which lasted just one season; \"Compos\" promoted again in 1980, this time lasting six years.\nRelegation in 1986 was compounded by off-field controversy surrounding the actions of then president Francisco Steppe. He resigned amid allegations of receipt of payments to throw a game against Pontevedra CF, which would assure the opposition's maintenance in the category. The late 1980s saw a significant restructuring of the club both at board and management levels and, in 1990, Compostela regained third-level status.\nThe following campaign was to prove the club's most successful to date. On 23 June 1991, a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the \"Estadio Municipal Santa Isabel\", saw goals from Juanito and Ochoa (two) clinch a 3\u20131 victory in the final play-off match against CD Badajoz, for a first-ever Segunda Divisi\u00F3n visit.\nThe move to \"Estadio Multiusos de San L\u00E1zaro\" coincided with the continuing rise in the team's fortunes and, at the end of 1993\u201394, following a 3\u20131 play-off victory against Rayo Vallecano, Compostela reached La Liga. Compostela did remarkably well, and reached a best finish of 10th in 1995\u201396, mainly courtesy of strikers Christopher Ohen and Bent Christensen, whom totalled 23 league goals.\nAfter four seasons at the top, Compostela was relegated after losing a relegation play-off match to Villarreal CF on the away goals rule, despite playing overall attractive football. The club was also about to start a downward spiral; after a relegation to the third level in 2001 the team returned the following year but, in the following campaign, played to a backdrop of off-field distractions, with the players and staff going unpaid for months \u2013 a final ninth place was not enough to prevent another relegation, as the club failed to meet the 31 July deadline to settle all wage debts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Football club"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"football","offset":19},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":48},{"uri":"Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n_B","surface_form":"Segunda Divisi\u00F3n B","offset":483},{"uri":"Pontevedra_CF","surface_form":"Pontevedra CF","offset":800},{"uri":"1990%E2%80%9391_Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n_B","surface_form":"The following campaign","offset":1029},{"uri":"CD_Badajoz","surface_form":"CD Badajoz","offset":1281},{"uri":"Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Segunda Divisi\u00F3n","offset":1310},{"uri":"Estadio_Multiusos_de_San_L%C3%A1zaro","surface_form":"Estadio Multiusos de San L\u00E1zaro","offset":1347},{"uri":"1993%E2%80%9394_Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"1993\u201394","offset":1457},{"uri":"Rayo_Vallecano","surface_form":"Rayo Vallecano","offset":1507},{"uri":"La_Liga","surface_form":"La Liga","offset":1542},{"uri":"1995%E2%80%9396_La_Liga","surface_form":"1995\u201396","offset":1620},{"uri":"Forward_(association_football)","surface_form":"strikers","offset":1648},{"uri":"Christopher_Ohen","surface_form":"Christopher Ohen","offset":1657},{"uri":"Bent_Christensen_Arens%C3%B8e","surface_form":"Bent Christensen","offset":1678},{"uri":"Villarreal_CF","surface_form":"Villarreal CF","offset":1827},{"uri":"Away_goals_rule","surface_form":"away goals rule","offset":1848},{"uri":"2000%E2%80%9301_Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"2001","offset":2003},{"uri":"2002%E2%80%9303_Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n","surface_form":"the following campaign","offset":2053}]}
