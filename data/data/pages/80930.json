{"id":80930,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitne_(moon)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Aitne or, is a non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard, \"et al.\" in 2001, and given the designation.\nAitne is about 3\u00A0kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,285,000\u00A0km in 679.641 days, at an inclination of 166\u00B0 to the ecliptic (164\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.393.\nIt was named in August 2003 after Aitna or Aitne, the divine personification of Mount Etna, whose sons by Zeus (Jupiter) are the Palici, the twin sicilian gods of geysers (other authors have them descend from Thalia and/or Hephaistos).\nAitne belongs to the Carme group, made up of non-spherical irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000\u00A0km and at an inclination of about 165\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":32},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":50},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":106},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
