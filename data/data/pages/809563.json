{"id":809563,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtensteiner_Americans","text":"Liechtensteiner Americans are Americans of Liechtensteiner descent.\nHistory.\nThe first Liechtensteiner emigrants of which have record emigrated in United States in the early 1830s. However, first great wave of Liechtensteiner emigrants arrived to the United States on April 7, 1851, settling in New Orleans; and in 1852 other group emigrated to Dubuque, Iowa (including stonemasons, bricklayers and carpenters). Eventually, many of the Liechtensteiner emigrants of Dubuque left the city and got farms nearby. However, the Liechtensteiner emigration was reduced during the American Civil War (1861-1865). Later, when the construction of railroads began \"lying the country together and opening up the West\", other Liechtensteiners emigrated to United States to work in the construction of railroads.\nDuring the following decades, many other Liechtensteiners emigrated to places such as Guttenberg, Iowa and Wabash, Indiana. However, between 1885 and 1907, Liechtensteiner emigration slowed, limited to a few individuals and families. Less than 30 Liechtensteiners emigrated during that period to United States. Reducing migration was due to the large increase in economic activity from the establishment of first textile factories in the 1880s.\nThe First World War caused an economic crisis in Liechtenstein (which originated, among other things, because the Entente allies stopped the \"import of raw materials\" into the country and the \"massive speculation by the national bank\"), so the Liechtenstein emigration to United States was retaken. Most of the new Liechtensteiner emigrants settled in urban areas, especially in Chicago and Hammond, Indiana, but there were Liechtensteiners throughout the country.\nAfter the Second World War, a few more Liechtensteiners emigrated to the United States, the largest number arriving in 1948, when fifteen individuals or families came to this country. The reduction of the Liechtenstein emigration was due to improvements in economic conditions of Liechtenstein.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"Americans","offset":30},{"uri":"Liechtenstein","surface_form":"Liechtenstein","offset":43},{"uri":"Emigrants","surface_form":"emigrants","offset":103},{"uri":"New_Orleans","surface_form":"New Orleans","offset":295},{"uri":"Dubuque%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"Dubuque, Iowa","offset":345},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":572},{"uri":"Guttenberg%2C_Iowa","surface_form":"Guttenberg, Iowa","offset":884},{"uri":"Wabash%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Wabash, Indiana","offset":905},{"uri":"First_World_War","surface_form":"First World War","offset":1247},{"uri":"Chicago","surface_form":"Chicago","offset":1622},{"uri":"Hammond%2C_Indiana","surface_form":"Hammond, Indiana","offset":1634},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"Second World War","offset":1718}]}
