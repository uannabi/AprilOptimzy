Gladman, \"et al.\" in 2003 and called until 2009.\nHerse is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,134,000\u00A0km in 672.752 days, at an inclination of 162\u00B0 to the ecliptic (161\u00B0 to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2379.\nIt is the closest member of the Carme group, made up of non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000\u00A0km and at an inclination of about 165\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":24},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":32},{"uri":"Brett_J._Gladman","surface_form":"Brett J.
