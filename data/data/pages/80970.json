{"id":80970,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_Trojan","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Neptune Trojan is an asteroid which is in the same orbit as the planet Neptune.\nTheir name comes from the Trojan asteroids which have the same orbital period as a planet. As of March 2007, there are six known Neptune Trojans. They lie in the elongated, curved region around the L4 Lagrangian point 60\u00B0 ahead of Neptune. The six Neptune Trojans are, 385571 Otrera, 385695 Clete, and.\nThe discovery of in a high inclination (>25\u00B0) orbit is significant because it suggests a \u2018thick\u2019 cloud of Trojans. It is believed that large (radius \u2248 100\u00A0km) Neptune Trojans could greatly outnumber the Jupiter Trojans.\nThe New Horizons spacecraft passed through the L5 Neptune region in 2014. It was preparing to observe Pluto and did not observe any asteroids there.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":36},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":66},{"uri":"Planet","surface_form":"planet","offset":79},{"uri":"Neptune_(planet)","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":86},{"uri":"Trojan_asteroid","surface_form":"Trojan asteroid","offset":121},{"uri":"Curve","surface_form":"curve","offset":268},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":275},{"uri":"Lagrangian_point","surface_form":"L4","offset":293},{"uri":"Lagrangian_point","surface_form":"Lagrangian point","offset":296},{"uri":"385571_Otrera","surface_form":"385571 Otrera","offset":364},{"uri":"385695_Clete","surface_form":"385695 Clete","offset":379},{"uri":"Radius","surface_form":"radius","offset":540},{"uri":"Jupiter_Trojans","surface_form":"Jupiter Trojans","offset":601},{"uri":"New_Horizons","surface_form":"New Horizons","offset":622},{"uri":"Spacecraft","surface_form":"spacecraft","offset":635},{"uri":"Lagrangian_point","surface_form":"L5","offset":665},{"uri":"Pluto","surface_form":"Pluto","offset":720}]}
