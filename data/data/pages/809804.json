{"id":809804,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearberry","text":"Bearberry is the name for three species of small woody plants in the heath family, Ericaceae. They grow well in cold places. Each species has subspecies. They can grow well in poor soil (for example soil that is mostly sand).\nThey have edible fruit. Their leaves are sometimes used for folk medicine. The common name comes from the fact that bears often eat them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"small woody plants","offset":43},{"uri":"Heath","surface_form":"heath","offset":69},{"uri":"Ericaceae","surface_form":"Ericaceae","offset":83},{"uri":"Sand","surface_form":"sand","offset":219},{"uri":"Edible","surface_form":"edible","offset":236},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":243},{"uri":"Leaf","surface_form":"leaves","offset":256},{"uri":"Bear","surface_form":"bears","offset":342}]}
