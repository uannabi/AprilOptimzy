In the Mobilizon we designed, there are no likes, incentives to create the narrative of your life on a wall, and no echo chambers to these frustrating dialogues where everyone shouts and no one listens\".\"\nTechnology.\nThe software is written in the Elixir programming language with Phoenix, a lightweight framework that takes advantage of Elixir.\nThe user interface is built with the VueJS framework.\nMobilizon is federated to a network of instances capable of communicating with each other thanks to the ActivityPub protocol, a W3C standard. It will also enable interaction with other software applications that make up the fediverse, such as Mastodon, PeerTube, etc. Most federation code comes from Pleroma, popular microbloging software.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Free_and_open-source_software","surface_form":"free and open source","offset":28},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":257},{"uri":"Framasoft_association","surface_form":"Framasoft association","offset":383}]}
