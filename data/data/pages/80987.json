{"id":80987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_free_settlers","text":"e=\"preserve\">English free settlers were people that chose to go to New Holland (now Australia). They were not forced to go there, as the convicts were. The English free settlers went to Australia between the late 18th century and the early 19th century. When the English free settlers got to Australia, they landed in the southern part of the continent. That was the only colony created by the free settlers.\nThe English free settlers went to Australia to be free. They wanted to make money as well. They also wanted to explore Australia families who wanted a better life with their children. Some people called the English Free settlers \"pilgrims\".\nIn the early years of the colony, very few settlers came to Australia. Free settlers had to fund their own transport and were usually quite wealthy. The few who made the journey to Australia did so mostly to make their fortune. They were often given large land grants and convicts to work for them.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":84},{"uri":"Criminal","surface_form":"convicts","offset":137},{"uri":"Continent","surface_form":"continent","offset":343},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colony","offset":372},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":485},{"uri":"Children","surface_form":"children","offset":583},{"uri":"Pilgrim","surface_form":"pilgrim","offset":639}]}
