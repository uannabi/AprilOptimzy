In 2015 the success of the new venture grew well and they decided to stop manufacturing and installing windows and doors and focus on expanding their range of products for sale online and through a newly built local trade counter.\nIn 2017 they completely rebranded and opened the company known today as GB DIY Store.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
