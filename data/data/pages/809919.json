{"id":809919,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Headington_Shark","text":"The Headington Shark (\"Untitled 1986\") is a sculpture on the top of a house. It is at 2 New High Street, Headington, Oxford. The sculpture is a shark breaking the roof of the house.\nAbout the sculpture.\nThe shark was first put on the house on 9 August 1986. The house is owned by a radio presenter, Bill Heine. The sculpture is 4 long hundredweight and 25 feet long. It is made of painted fibreglass. It took 3 months to make the shark.\nThe statue was put together on the 41st anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki. It was designed by John Buckley. Anton Castiau made the sculpture. Heine said that the shark is \"saying something about CND, nuclear power, Chernobyl and Nagasaki\".\nOn August 2007, the shark was renovated by Buckley. This was because of complaints of the quality of the sculpture.\nOn 26 August 2016, Heine's son Magnus Hanson-Heine bought the house. He bought it so that the shark can stay on top of the house.\nControversy.\nThe shark started controversy when it was first put on the house. Oxford City Council wanted the shark removed from the house because it was not safe for the people living near. There were no planning permissions for the shark. In 1992, Minister Tony Baldry from the Department of the Environment said that the shark can stay on the house because it does not cause any problems.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculpture","offset":44},{"uri":"Headington%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Headington, Oxford","offset":105},{"uri":"Shark","surface_form":"shark","offset":144},{"uri":"Radio_presenter","surface_form":"radio presenter","offset":282},{"uri":"Bill_Heine","surface_form":"Bill Heine","offset":299},{"uri":"Hundredweight","surface_form":"long hundredweight","offset":330},{"uri":"Foot_(unit)","surface_form":"feet","offset":356},{"uri":"Fibreglass","surface_form":"fibreglass","offset":389},{"uri":"Anniversary","surface_form":"anniversary","offset":477},{"uri":"Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki","surface_form":"bombing of Nagasaki","offset":496},{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":524},{"uri":"John_Buckley_(sculptor)","surface_form":"John Buckley","offset":536},{"uri":"Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament","surface_form":"CND","offset":637},{"uri":"Nuclear_power","surface_form":"nuclear power","offset":642},{"uri":"Chernobyl_disaster","surface_form":"Chernobyl","offset":657},{"uri":"Renovate","surface_form":"renovated","offset":712},{"uri":"Complaint","surface_form":"complaints","offset":754},{"uri":"Buy","surface_form":"bought","offset":849},{"uri":"Controversy","surface_form":"controversy","offset":959},{"uri":"Oxford_City_Council","surface_form":"Oxford City Council","offset":1007},{"uri":"Planning_permission","surface_form":"planning permission","offset":1133},{"uri":"Minister","surface_form":"Minister","offset":1178},{"uri":"Tony_Baldry","surface_form":"Tony Baldry","offset":1187},{"uri":"Secretary_of_State_for_the_Environment","surface_form":"Department of the Environment","offset":1208},{"uri":"Problem","surface_form":"problem","offset":1310}]}
