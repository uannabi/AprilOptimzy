{"id":809984,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Third_Division_North","text":"The Third Division North was the 3rd division of the English football league system between 1921 to 1958. It ran along with the Third Division South, with clubs being either elected to the League or relegated from a higher division allocated to either league based on their geographical location. Some clubs in the English Midlands shuffled between the Third Division North and the Third Division South based on the composition of the two leagues.\nIts final season was the 1957\u201358 season. After that season, the North and South sections were merged to form the Third Division and the Fourth Division.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_football_league_system","surface_form":"English football league system","offset":53},{"uri":"Football_League_Third_Division_South","surface_form":"Third Division South","offset":128},{"uri":"Re-election_(Football_League)","surface_form":"elected to the League","offset":174},{"uri":"Promotion_and_relegation","surface_form":"relegated","offset":199},{"uri":"English_Midlands","surface_form":"English Midlands","offset":315},{"uri":"1957%E2%80%9358_Football_League_Third_Division_North","surface_form":"1957\u201358 season","offset":473},{"uri":"Football_League_Third_Division","surface_form":"Third Division","offset":561},{"uri":"Football_League_Fourth_Division","surface_form":"Fourth Division","offset":584}]}
