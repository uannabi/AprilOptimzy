{"id":810101,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tagging","text":"There are special electronic devices, that can be permanently attached to a person. These devices are called electronic tags. Using wireless or mobile phone networks, it is then possible to monitor where the person is, all the time. The device can also have extra functions, such as measuring certain parameters.\nEspecially in the case of monitoring old people, there have been concerns about privacy.\nIn the case of monitoring a criminal or someone on probation, the person has to report to a base station at given times. When the base station no longer detects the signal from the tag, it will alert the authorities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Wireless_LAN","surface_form":"wireless","offset":132},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":144},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"networks","offset":157}]}
