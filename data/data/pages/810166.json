{"id":810166,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(espionage)","text":"=\"preserve\">In espionage jargon a mole (\"deep cover agent\", or \"sleeper\") is a long-term spy.\nThe spy is recruited \"before\" having access to secret intelligence. Later, if he gets into the target organization, he or she becomes active.\nHowever, it is popularly used to mean any long-term clandestine spy or informer in an organization, government or private. In police work, a mole is an undercover law-enforcement agent who joins an organization in order to collect incriminating evidence about its operations, and so bring its members to justice.\nThe term was introduced to the public by British spy novelist John Le Carr\u00E9 in his 1974 novel \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Espionage","surface_form":"espionage","offset":15},{"uri":"Jargon","surface_form":"jargon","offset":25},{"uri":"Spy","surface_form":"spy","offset":89},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"police","offset":362},{"uri":"British","surface_form":"British","offset":590},{"uri":"Novelist","surface_form":"novelist","offset":602},{"uri":"John_Le_Carr%C3%A9","surface_form":"John Le Carr\u00E9","offset":611},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":637},{"uri":"Tinker%2C_Tailor%2C_Soldier%2C_Spy","surface_form":"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy","offset":644}]}
