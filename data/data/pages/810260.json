Thomas Alexander Mair, a 53-year-old gardener, was found guilty of the murder in September. He held far-right views and attacked her because she supported the European Union and immigration. He was sentenced to life imprisionment with a whole life order.\nThis was the first time a sitting MP had been killed since 1990, when Ian Gow was killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":8},{"uri":"Batley_and_Spen_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","surface_form":"Batley and Spen","offset":33},{"uri":"Jo_Cox","surface_form":"Jo Cox","offset":49},{"uri":"Shooting","surface_form":"shot","offset":79},{"uri":"Stabbing","surface_form":"stabbed","offset":88},{"uri":"Far-right","surface_form":"far-right","offset":224},{"uri":"European_Union","surface_form":"European Union","offset":283},{"uri":"Immigration","surface_form":"immigration","offset":302},{"uri":"Sentencing","surface_form":"sentenced","offset":322},{"uri":"Whole_life_order","surface_form":"whole life order","offset":361},{"uri":"Ian_Gow","surface_form":"Ian Gow","offset":449},{"uri":"Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","surface_form":"Provisional Irish Republican Army","offset":475}]}
