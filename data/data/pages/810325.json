{"id":810325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Vietnam","text":"ce=\"preserve\">Throughout history, there were many names used to refer to Vietnam.\nHistory.\nThroughout history of Vietnam, besides official names, there are names that are used unofficially to refer to the territory of Vietnam. Vietnam was ever called V\u0103n Lang during the H\u00F9ng V\u01B0\u01A1ng Dynasty, \u00C2u L\u1EA1c when An D\u01B0\u01A1ng was king, Nam Vi\u1EC7t during the Tri\u1EC7u Dynasty, Van Xuan during the Anterior L\u00FD Dynasty, \u0110\u1EA1i C\u1ED3 Vi\u1EC7t during the \u0110inh dynasty and Early L\u00EA dynasty. Starting in 1054, Vietnam was called \u0110\u1EA1i Vi\u1EC7t (Great Viet). During the H\u1ED3 dynasty, Vietnam was called \u0110\u1EA1i Ngu.\nVi\u1EC7t Nam (in Vietnamese) is a variation of Nam Vi\u1EC7t (Southern Vi\u1EC7t), a name that can be traced back to the Tri\u1EC7u dynasty (2nd century BC, also known as Nanyue Kingdom). The word \"Vi\u1EC7t\" originated as a shortened form of B\u00E1ch Vi\u1EC7t, a word used to refer to a people who lived in what is now southern China in ancient times. The word \"Vi\u1EC7t Nam\", with the syllables in the modern order, first appears in the 16th century in a poem by Nguy\u1EC5n B\u1EC9nh Khi\u00EAm. \"Annam\", which originated as a Chinese name in the seventh century, was the common name of the country during the colonial period. Nationalist writer Phan B\u1ED9i Ch\u00E2u revived the name \"Vietnam\" in the early 20th century. When rival communist and anti-communist governments were set up in 1945, both immediately adopted this as the country's official name. In English, the two syllables are usually combined into one word, \"Vietnam\". However, \"Viet Nam\" was once common usage and is still used by the United Nations and by the Vietnamese government.\nOrigin of \"Vietnam\".\nThe term \" (Yue) (), Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"\u6209\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (BC), and later as \"\u8D8A\". At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Vi\u1EC7t referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people.\nFrom the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam, with particular states or groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: L\u1EA1c Vi\u1EC7t), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (B\u00E1ch Vi\u1EC7t,;). The term Baiyue/B\u00E1ch Vi\u1EC7t first appeared in the book \"L\u00FCshi Chunqiu\" compiled around 239 BC.\nIn 207 BC, former Qin dynasty general Zhao Tuo/Tri\u1EC7u \u0110\u00E0 founded the kingdom Nanyue/Nam Vi\u1EC7t () with its capital at Panyu (modern Guangzhou). This kingdom was \"southern\" in the sense that it was located south of other Baiyue kingdoms such as Minyue and Ouyue, located in modern Fujian and Zhejiang. Several later Vietnamese dynasties followed this nomenclature even after these more northern peoples were absorbed into China.\nIn \"S\u1EA5m Tr\u1EA1ng Tr\u00ECnh\" (The Prophecies of Tr\u1EA1ng Tr\u00ECnh), poet Nguyen Binh Khi\u00EAm (1491\u20131585) reversed the traditional order of the syllables and put the name in its modern form: \"Vietnam is being created\" (). At this time, the country was divided between the Tr\u1ECBnh lords of Hanoi and the Nguy\u1EC5n lords of Hu\u1EBF. By combining several existing names, Nam Vi\u1EC7t, Annam (Pacified South), \u0110\u1EA1i Vi\u1EC7t (Great Vi\u1EC7t), and \"Nam qu\u1ED1c\" (southern nation), Khi\u00EAm could create a new name that referred to an aspirational unified state. The word \"nam\" no longer implies Southern Vi\u1EC7t, but rather that Vietnam is \"the South\" in contrast to China, \"the North\". This explanation is implied by L\u00FD Th\u01B0\u1EDDng Ki\u1EC7t in the poem \"Nam qu\u1ED1c s\u01A1n h\u00E0\" (1077): \"Over the mountains and rivers of the South, reigns the emperor of the South.\" Researcher Nguy\u1EC5n Ph\u00FAc Gi\u00E1c H\u1EA3i found the word \u8D8A\u5357 \"Vi\u1EC7t Nam\" on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at B\u1EA3o L\u00E2m Pagoda, Haiphong (1558). Nguy\u1EC5n Ph\u00FAc Chu (1675\u20131725) used the word in a poem: \"This is the most dangerous mountain in Vietnam\" (). It was used as an official name by Emperor Gia Long in 1804-1813. The Jiaqing Emperor refused Gia Long's request to change his country's name to Nam Vi\u1EC7t, and changed the name instead to Vi\u1EC7t Nam. Gia Long's \u0110\u1EA1i Nam th\u1EF1c l\u1EE5c contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming.\nThe use of \"Vietnam\" was revived in modern times by nationalists including Phan B\u1ED9i Ch\u00E2u, whose book \"Vi\u1EC7t Nam vong qu\u1ED1c s\u1EED\" (History of the Loss of Vietnam) was published in 1906. Chau also founded the Vi\u1EC7t Nam Quang Ph\u1EE5c H\u1ED9i (Vietnam Restoration League) in 1912. However, the general public continued to use Annam and the name \"Vietnam\" remained virtually unknown until the Y\u00EAn B\u00E1i mutiny of 1930, organized by the Vi\u1EC7t Nam Qu\u1ED1c D\u00E2n \u0110\u1EA3ng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party). By the early 1940s, the use of \"Vi\u1EC7t Nam\" was widespread. It appeared in the name of Ho Chi Minh's Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Viet Minh), founded 1941, and was even used by the governor of French Indochina in 1942. The name \"Vietnam\" has been official since 1945. It was adopted in June by B\u1EA3o \u0110\u1EA1i's imperial government in Hu\u1EBF, and in September by Ho's rival communist government in Hanoi.\nCulture.\nIn English, the spellings Vietnam, Viet-Nam, and Viet Nam have all been used. The 1954 edition of \"Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary\" gave both the unspaced and hyphenated forms; in response to a letter from a reader, the editors indicated that the spaced form Viet Nam was also acceptable, though they stated that because Anglophones did not know the meaning of the two words making up the name Vietnam, \"it is not surprising\" that there was a tendency to drop the space. In 1966, the U.S. government was known to use all three renderings, with the State Department preferring the hyphenated version. By 1981, the hyphenated form was regarded as \"dated\", according to Scottish writer Gilbert Adair, and he titled his book about depictions of the country in film using the unhyphenated and unspaced form \"Vietnam\".\nThe modern Chinese name for Vietnam () can be translated as \"Beyond the South\", leading to the folk etymology that the name is a reference to the country's location beyond the southernmost borders of China. Another theory explains that the nation was termed as such in order to emphasize the division of those who stayed in China in contrast to the people living in Vietnam.\nBoth Japanese and Korean formerly referred to Vietnam by their respective Sino-Xenic pronunciations of the Chinese characters for its names, but later switched to using direct phonetic transcriptions. In Japanese, following the independence of Vietnam the names and were largely replaced by the phonetic transcription, written in katakana script; however, the old form is still seen in compound words (e.g., \"a visit to Vietnam\"). Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sometimes used an alternative spelling. Similarly, in the Korean language, in line with the trend towards decreasing usage of hanja, the Sino-Korean-derived name \"Wollam\" (, the Korean reading of) has been replaced by \"Beteunam\" () in South Korea and \"Wennam\" () in North Korea.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":73},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":113},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":218},{"uri":"Vietnam","surface_form":"Vietnam","offset":227},{"uri":"V%C4%83n_Lang","surface_form":"V\u0103n
