{"id":810631,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Investment_Bank","text":"The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a publicly owned international financial institution whose shareholders are the EU member states. It was created in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome as a \"policy-driven bank\" using financing operations to further EU policy goals such as European integration and social cohesion. It should not be confused with the European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt (Germany) or with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) which is based in London (United Kingdom).\nThe member states set the bank's broad policy goals and oversee the decision-making bodies of the bank: its board of governors and board of directors. It is the world's largest international public lending institution.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"International_financial_institutions","surface_form":"international financial institution","offset":55},{"uri":"European_Union_member_state","surface_form":"EU member states","offset":118},{"uri":"Treaty_of_Rome","surface_form":"Treaty of Rome","offset":169},{"uri":"European_integration","surface_form":"European integration","offset":272},{"uri":"Social_cohesion","surface_form":"social cohesion","offset":297},{"uri":"European_Central_Bank","surface_form":"European Central Bank","offset":349},{"uri":"Frankfurt","surface_form":"Frankfurt","offset":390},{"uri":"European_Bank_for_Reconstruction_and_Development","surface_form":"European Bank for Reconstruction and Development","offset":422},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":496}]}
