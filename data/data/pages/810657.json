{"id":810657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_irae","text":"\" (; \"the Day of Wrath\") is a Latin chant first written by either Thomas of Celano of the Franciscans (1200\u2013c.1265) or Latino Malabranca Orsini (d. 1294), lector at the Dominican \"studium\" at Santa Sabina, in Rome. It comes from at least the 13th century, but it could be much older. Some have said it was written by St. Gregory the Great (died 604), Bernard of Clairvaux (1090\u20131153), or Bonaventure (1221\u20131274).\nIt is a poem in Medieval Latin with accentual stress and rhymed lines. The metre is trochaic. It is about the Last Judgment. It is known for being used at the Requiem (funeral mass).\nThe first melody to these words is used a lot in musical literature. Many recent movies like \"The Shining\" and \"The Lion King\" have used it.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":30},{"uri":"Chant","surface_form":"chant","offset":36},{"uri":"Thomas_of_Celano","surface_form":"Thomas of Celano","offset":66},{"uri":"Franciscans","surface_form":"Franciscans","offset":90},{"uri":"Latino_Malabranca_Orsini","surface_form":"Latino Malabranca Orsini","offset":119},{"uri":"Dominican_Order","surface_form":"Dominican","offset":169},{"uri":"Santa_Sabina","surface_form":"Santa Sabina","offset":192},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":209},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":242},{"uri":"Pope_Gregory_I","surface_form":"St. Gregory the Great","offset":317},{"uri":"Bernard_of_Clairvaux","surface_form":"Bernard of Clairvaux","offset":351},{"uri":"Bonaventure","surface_form":"Bonaventure","offset":388},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":421},{"uri":"Medieval_Latin","surface_form":"Medieval Latin","offset":429},{"uri":"Accentual_verse","surface_form":"accentual stress","offset":449},{"uri":"Rhyming","surface_form":"rhymed","offset":470},{"uri":"Metre_(poetry)","surface_form":"metre","offset":488},{"uri":"Trochee","surface_form":"trochaic","offset":497},{"uri":"Last_Judgment","surface_form":"Last Judgment","offset":523},{"uri":"Requiem","surface_form":"Requiem","offset":572},{"uri":"Mass_(liturgy)","surface_form":"mass","offset":589},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melody","offset":606},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":645},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":653},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":677},{"uri":"The_Shining_(movie)","surface_form":"The Shining","offset":690},{"uri":"The_Lion_King","surface_form":"The Lion King","offset":708}]}
