{"id":810744,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papurana","text":"\"Papurana\" is a genus of frogs in the family Ranidae, \"true frogs.\" They live in New Guinea, some islands near New Guinea, and in northern Australia. \"Papurana daemeli\" is the only frog in Ranidae that lives in Australia.\nTaxonomy.\nScientists first named \"Papurana\" as a subgenus of \"Rana\". At times, they have said it was a subgenus of \"Hylarana\". In 2015, Oliver and colleagues looked at \"Hylarana\" closely and said it should have only a few species in it. They said \"Papurana\" should be its own genus.\nDescription.\n\"Papurana\" frogs have a mask mark behind their eyes, their body shape, strong wavy stripes on the backs of their thighs, and either no dorsolateral folds or very thin folds, with rough spots. The back is evenly roughened to warty and sometimes has small spikes. The frogs are medium to very large in size. Male frogs have paired, external organs for making sounds.\nSpecies.\n\"Papurana elberti\", \"Papurana florensis\", and \"Papurana moluccana\" are only provisionally allocated to \"Papurana\", meaning scientists want to collect more data on their bodies and genes before deciding.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ranidae","surface_form":"Ranidae","offset":45},{"uri":"New_Guinea","surface_form":"New Guinea","offset":81},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":139},{"uri":"Papurana_daemeli","surface_form":"Papurana daemeli","offset":151},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":211},{"uri":"Subgenus","surface_form":"subgenus","offset":271},{"uri":"Rana_(genus)","surface_form":"Rana","offset":284},{"uri":"Hylarana","surface_form":"Hylarana","offset":338},{"uri":"Dorsum_(anatomy)","surface_form":"back","offset":714},{"uri":"Vocal_sac","surface_form":"organs for making sound","offset":857}]}
