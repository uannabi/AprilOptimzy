{"id":810808,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_1962_Alcatraz_escape_attempt","text":"The June 1962 Alcatraz escape was a prison escape from Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay. Inmates Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin were the ones who escaped from the prison. The three men were able to escape from their cells and leave the island in a raft.\nHowever it is unknown if Morris and the Aglin brothers escaped alive or drowned to death. The inmates who escaped created fake heads to trick the guards into thinking they were asleep in their cells. They also made a raft to escape.\nIn 1979, the FBI officially closed its investigation, saying that the men drowned in San Francisco Bay, while trying to reach land. However, the United States Marshals Service has continued to keep the escapees on its wanted list as many people reported to have seen them in Florida, Maryland and even Brazil.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alcatraz_Federal_Penitentiary","surface_form":"Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary","offset":55},{"uri":"San_Francisco_Bay","surface_form":"San Francisco Bay","offset":88},{"uri":"Drowned","surface_form":"drowned","offset":364},{"uri":"United_States_Marshals_Service","surface_form":"United States Marshals Service","offset":670},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":800},{"uri":"Maryland","surface_form":"Maryland","offset":809},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":827}]}
