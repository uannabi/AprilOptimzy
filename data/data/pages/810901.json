{"id":810901,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_convertible_peso","text":"e=\"preserve\">The convertible peso (sometimes given as \"CUC$\" and informally called a \"cuc\" or a \"chavito\") was one of two official currencies in Cuba, the other being the Cuban peso. It has been in limited use since 1994.\nOn 8 November 2004, the U.S. dollar was officially no longer accepted in Cuba (though \"unofficially\" it was). Its value was increased to US$1.08 in April 2005, but went back to US$1.00 on 15 March 2011.\nOn 22 October 2013, it was announced that the convertible peso would end, being gradually unified with the lower-value Cuban peso. On 10 December 2020, it was announced that the convertible peso will no longer be in effect, from 1 January 2021.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cuba","surface_form":"Cuba","offset":145},{"uri":"Cuban_peso","surface_form":"Cuban peso","offset":171}]}
