{"id":81095,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Antioch","text":"Saint Ignatius of Antioch (also known as Theophorus) (ca. 35-107) was the third Bishop or Patriarch of Antioch and a student of the Apostle John. En route to his martyrdom in Rome, Ignatius wrote a series of letters, including one to Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who had also known John. These letters are an example of the theology of the earliest Christians. Important topics addressed in these letters include ecclesiology, the sacraments, and the role of bishops.\nIgnatius' feast day is observed on 17 October in Western Christianity and 20 December in Eastern Christianity.\nIgnatius became Bishop of Antioch after Saint Peter and Evodius, who died around AD 67.\nBesides the Latin name, Ignatius, he also called himself Theophorus (\"God Bearer\"), and tradition says he was one of the children Jesus took in His arms and blessed. Ignatius was most likely a disciple of the Apostle John.\nIgnatius is generally considered to be one of the Apostolic Fathers (the earliest authoritative group of the Church Fathers) and a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, Lutheran Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and Episcopal Church who celebrate his feast day on October 17, and the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, who celebrate his feast day on December 20. Ignatius based his authority on living his life in imitation of Christ.\nMartyrdom.\nHe died as a martyr in the arena. This was during the reign of Trajan. The Roman authorities hoped to make an example of him and thus discourage Christianity from spreading. Instead, he met with and encouraged Christians who flocked to meet him all along his route, and he wrote seven letters to the churches in the region and one to a fellow bishop.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"35","surface_form":"35","offset":58},{"uri":"107","surface_form":"107","offset":61},{"uri":"Patriarch","surface_form":"Patriarch","offset":90},{"uri":"Antioch","surface_form":"Antioch","offset":103},{"uri":"John_the_Apostle","surface_form":"Apostle John","offset":132},{"uri":"Martyr","surface_form":"martyr","offset":162},{"uri":"Rome","surface_form":"Rome","offset":175},{"uri":"Polycarp","surface_form":"Polycarp","offset":234},{"uri":"%C4%B0zmir","surface_form":"Smyrna","offset":254},{"uri":"Christian_theology","surface_form":"theology","offset":323},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":348},{"uri":"Ecclesiology","surface_form":"ecclesiology","offset":412},{"uri":"Sacrament","surface_form":"sacrament","offset":430},{"uri":"Bishop","surface_form":"bishop","offset":458},{"uri":"17_October","surface_form":"17 October","offset":502},{"uri":"Western_Christianity","surface_form":"Western Christianity","offset":516},{"uri":"20_December","surface_form":"20 December","offset":541},{"uri":"Eastern_Christianity","surface_form":"Eastern Christianity","offset":556},{"uri":"Saint_Peter","surface_form":"Saint Peter","offset":618},{"uri":"67","surface_form":"67","offset":662},{"uri":"John_the_Apostle","surface_form":"Apostle John","offset":875},{"uri":"Apostolic_Fathers","surface_form":"Apostolic Fathers","offset":939},{"uri":"Church_Fathers","surface_form":"Church Fathers","offset":998},{"uri":"Saint","surface_form":"saint","offset":1020},{"uri":"Roman_Catholic_Church","surface_form":"Roman Catholic Church","offset":1033},{"uri":"Lutheran_Church","surface_form":"Lutheran Church","offset":1056},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodox_Church","surface_form":"Eastern Orthodox Church","offset":1073},{"uri":"Anglican_Church","surface_form":"Episcopal Church","offset":1101},{"uri":"October_17","surface_form":"October 17","offset":1149},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodoxy","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":1169},{"uri":"Eastern_Catholic","surface_form":"Eastern Catholic","offset":1182},{"uri":"December_20","surface_form":"December 20","offset":1240},{"uri":"Trajan","surface_form":"Trajan","offset":1399},{"uri":"Christianity","surface_form":"Christianity","offset":1481}]}
