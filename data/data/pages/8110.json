{"id":8110,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver","text":"Vancouver is a coastal city and major seaport on the mainland of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. The city has a population of over 630,000 and is the largest city in British Columbia. Metro Vancouver has a population of over 2 million people. That makes it the third largest metropolitan area in Canada. Vancouver has a mix of people from different cultures. Fifty-two percent of city residents have a first language that is not English.\nHistory.\nNative People began living in this area around 10,000-8,000 years ago. These people were part of three main groups: the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh.\nVancouver was founded in 1886, and is named after British naval captain George Vancouver. Captain Vancouver explored the area around Vancouver and Vancouver Island in the 1790s.\nBuildings and information.\nThe University of British Columbia is in Vancouver.\nVancouver also has Stanley Park which has beaches and totem poles. Nearby is Grouse Mountain which has good skiing and has a 2.9\u00A0km (1.8\u00A0mi.) hiking trail which is known as the Grouse Grind. Grouse Mountain also has an animal sanctuary, including wolves and bears.\nThe Lions Gate Bridge is also in Stanley Park, Vancouver.\nSports.\nVancouver has two ice hockey teams, the Vancouver Canucks (who play for the National Hockey League) and the Vancouver Giants (who play for the Western Hockey League).\nThe BC Lions of the Canadian Football League are based in Vancouver. The team has won 6 Grey Cups.\nIn soccer, Vancouver is home to the Vancouver Whitecaps FC. They play in the Major League Soccer (MLS).\nThe 2010 Winter Olympics were held in Vancouver and it was the first time Canada won a gold medal on Canadian soil.\nGeography.\nVancouver is on a peninsula on the West Coast of Canada, less than a one-hour drive north of the Canada-U.S. border.\nBetween Vancouver and the Pacific Ocean to the west is a large island called Vancouver Island. Until the city was named in 1885, \"Vancouver\" referred to Vancouver Island. Some people mistakenly think that the city is on Vancouver Island.\nOn the south shore of Vancouver is the Fraser River, which flows west into the Strait of Georgia. The water along the north shore is called Burrard Inlet.\nThe city has an area of 114\u00A0square kilometres (44\u00A0sq\u00A0mi). The larger metropolitan area is 2,878\u00A0square kilometres (1,111\u00A0sq\u00A0mi).\nAs with most of British Columbia, Vancouver is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC\u22128).\nClimate.\nVancouver has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\" in the K\u00F6ppen climate classification). The average precipitation per year is 1189\u00A0mm, mostly from October to April. High temperatures in the summer average 22\u00A0\u00B0C. The highest temperature ever recorded was 34.4\u00A0\u00B0C on July 30, 2009. On average, snow falls on only 11 days per year. The snow is usually wet, not very deep, and melts in the rain. On average, on only 4.5 days a year does the temperature not rise above freezing.\nHousing in Vancouver.\nVancouver has had a housing affordability crisis for many years. It came in as the second-least affordable housing market compared with 90 other metropolitan areas in different countries. The only place considered less affordable was Hong Kong.\nVancouver has been criticized for saying that it provides many social housing units to residents. However \"social housing\" can refer to small apartments renting for $1,700 per month. There are people with household incomes of up to $120,000 living in \"social housing\" in Vancouver.\nThe government has been attempting to address the housing crisis situation by imposing a series of taxes such as the Foreign-buyers tax and Empty Homes Tax in 2016 and Speculation tax in 2018.\nRents in Vancouver were very high, and apartment vacancies were very low in 2019.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":23},{"uri":"Seaport","surface_form":"seaport","offset":38},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":78},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":96},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":108},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":173},{"uri":"Million","surface_form":"million","offset":234},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":303},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":409},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":436},{"uri":"George_Vancouver","surface_form":"George Vancouver","offset":686},{"uri":"Vancouver_Island","surface_form":"Vancouver Island","offset":761},{"uri":"University_of_British_Columbia","surface_form":"University of British Columbia","offset":823},{"uri":"Stanley_Park","surface_form":"Stanley Park","offset":890},{"uri":"Totemism","surface_form":"totem poles","offset":925},{"uri":"Grouse_Mountain","surface_form":"Grouse Mountain","offset":948},{"uri":"Hiking","surface_form":"hiking","offset":1013},{"uri":"Trail","surface_form":"trail","offset":1020},{"uri":"Wolf","surface_form":"wolves","offset":1118},{"uri":"Bear","surface_form":"bear","offset":1129},{"uri":"Lions_Gate_Bridge","surface_form":"Lions Gate Bridge","offset":1140},{"uri":"Ice_hockey","surface_form":"ice hockey","offset":1220},{"uri":"Vancouver_Canucks","surface_form":"Vancouver Canucks","offset":1242},{"uri":"National_Hockey_League","surface_form":"National Hockey League","offset":1278},{"uri":"Vancouver_Giants","surface_form":"Vancouver Giants","offset":1310},{"uri":"Western_Hockey_League","surface_form":"Western Hockey League","offset":1345},{"uri":"BC_Lions","surface_form":"BC Lions","offset":1373},{"uri":"Canadian_Football_League","surface_form":"Canadian Football League","offset":1389},{"uri":"Grey_Cup","surface_form":"Grey Cup","offset":1457},{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"soccer","offset":1471},{"uri":"Vancouver_Whitecaps_FC","surface_form":"Vancouver Whitecaps FC","offset":1504},{"uri":"Major_League_Soccer","surface_form":"Major League Soccer","offset":1545},{"uri":"2010_Winter_Olympics","surface_form":"2010 Winter Olympics","offset":1576},{"uri":"Peninsula","surface_form":"peninsula","offset":1717},{"uri":"Border","surface_form":"border","offset":1808},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific Ocean","offset":1842},{"uri":"Vancouver_Island","surface_form":"Vancouver Island","offset":1893},{"uri":"Fraser_River","surface_form":"Fraser River","offset":2093},{"uri":"Strait_of_Georgia","surface_form":"Strait of Georgia","offset":2133},{"uri":"Burrard_Inlet","surface_form":"Burrard Inlet","offset":2194},{"uri":"Square_kilometre","surface_form":"square kilometre","offset":2237},{"uri":"Square_mile","surface_form":"sq\u00A0mi","offset":2259},{"uri":"Metropolitan_area","surface_form":"metropolitan area","offset":2278},{"uri":"Oceanic_climate","surface_form":"oceanic climate","offset":2445},{"uri":"K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification","surface_form":"K\u00F6ppen climate classification","offset":2475},{"uri":"Precipitation","surface_form":"precipitation","offset":2519},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":2711},{"uri":"Housing_affordability","surface_form":"housing affordability","offset":2935},{"uri":"Housing_market","surface_form":"housing market","offset":3022},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":3149},{"uri":"Social_housing","surface_form":"social housing","offset":3223},{"uri":"Household_income","surface_form":"household income","offset":3365},{"uri":"Foreign-buyers_tax","surface_form":"Foreign-buyers tax","offset":3559},{"uri":"Empty_Homes_Tax","surface_form":"Empty Homes Tax","offset":3582},{"uri":"Speculation_tax","surface_form":"Speculation tax","offset":3610},{"uri":"Rents","surface_form":"Rents","offset":3635},{"uri":"Rental_vacancy_rate","surface_form":"vacancies","offset":3684}]}
