{"id":811377,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Top_40","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"American Top 40\" (usually abbreviated to \"AT40\") is a syndicated radio program. AT40 was created by Casey Kasem in 1970. Kasem hosted \"American Top 40\" between July 4, 1970 and August 6, 1988. Shadoe Stevens took over from August 13, 1988 to January 1995. Kasem began hosting again in 1998. On January 10, 2004, Ryan Seacrest took over the radio program.\nThe radio show was originally a production for Watermark, Inc. (later a member of ABC Radio known as ABC Watermark).\nSome of the songs played on \"AT40\" had profanity or offensive content inside them. During the Shadoe Stevens era of \"AT40\", 2 Live Crew's \"Me So Horny\" aired in autumn 1989.\nHip hop music was played on the \"AT40\" mostly in the late 1980s and 1990s. It continues now.\nIn the 1970s, disco music aired on \"AT40\".\nNo song began at #1. The closest to that happening was \"Erotica\" by Madonna in 1992.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Syndicated","surface_form":"syndicated","offset":68},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":79},{"uri":"Casey_Kasem","surface_form":"Casey Kasem","offset":114},{"uri":"Shadoe_Stevens","surface_form":"Shadoe Stevens","offset":207},{"uri":"Ryan_Seacrest","surface_form":"Ryan Seacrest","offset":326},{"uri":"Watermark%2C_Inc.","surface_form":"Watermark, Inc.","offset":416},{"uri":"Profanity","surface_form":"profanity","offset":525},{"uri":"2_Live_Crew","surface_form":"2 Live Crew","offset":610},{"uri":"Hip_hop_music","surface_form":"Hip hop music","offset":660},{"uri":"Disco_music","surface_form":"disco music","offset":767},{"uri":"Erotica_(song)","surface_form":"Erotica","offset":852},{"uri":"Madonna","surface_form":"Madonna","offset":864}]}
