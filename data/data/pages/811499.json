Burns goes through with the idea and tells their town about it.\nElon makes many new machines around the town to save or make electrical energy, for example, a Hyperloop and self-driving cars. However, Burns learns that the town will lose $50 million every three months because of the machines. Burns must fire some of his employees at the power plant. Homer is sad because Musk's machines made his friends fired. On the next day, Burns tries to assassinate Elon. Elon stops a bullet from hitting him or hitting Homer.
