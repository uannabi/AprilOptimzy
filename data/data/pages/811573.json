{"id":811573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_grammar","text":"=\"preserve\">Spanish grammar is the rules for speaking and writing in the Spanish language. It is similar to the grammar of other Romance languages.\nVerbs.\nVerbs in Spanish belong to one of three classes: -\"ar\", -\"er\", and -\"ir\".\nVerbs are conjugated (changed) depending on tense and person. That means a verb talking about the past will have a different form than a verb about something happening right now.\nNouns.\nIn Spanish, every noun has a gender, either masculine or feminine.\nAdjectives.\nAdjectives usually go after the noun they describe and change depending on number and person.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish language","offset":73},{"uri":"Romance_languages","surface_form":"Romance languages","offset":129},{"uri":"Conjugation","surface_form":"conjugated","offset":239}]}
