{"id":811697,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simp","text":"e=\"preserve\">Simp is an internet slang term, usually with a pejorative meaning. It means a person, usually male, who appears to be trying to impress a person too much, usually to a person of the opposite sex. Sometimes, the motivation for a simp is to make the person they are trying to impress have an intimate relationship with them or to have sexual intercourse with them. If a person acts like a simp, that person is \"simping\". \"Simping\" is similar to the term \"stanning\" (too much interest in a celebrity).\nOriginally, the word \"simp\" was a shortening of the word \"simpleton\". Since the 2020s, it has been popularly used as an insult.\nIn May 2020, the streaming service Twitch had been actively removing emotes that reference the word \"simp\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet_slang","surface_form":"internet slang","offset":24},{"uri":"Pejorative","surface_form":"pejorative","offset":60},{"uri":"Intimate_relationship","surface_form":"intimate relationship","offset":303},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":346},{"uri":"Stan_(fan)","surface_form":"stanning","offset":466},{"uri":"Celebrity","surface_form":"celebrity","offset":500},{"uri":"Simpleton","surface_form":"simpleton","offset":570},{"uri":"Twitch_(service)","surface_form":"Twitch","offset":675}]}
