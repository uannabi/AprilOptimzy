The main language of the newspaper and its website is Russian, but some stories are written in Belarusian.\nIt has been writing about the 2020 Belarusian protests and 2020 Belarusian presidential election, so several journalists of the Brest newspaper have been tried and arrested for that.\nIn October 2020, the newspaper joined a common statement by the Belarusian Association of Journalists and private media companies on the troubles of TUT.BY and limits on the use of private websites. In late November, it became known that the Brest Regional Printing House, where the newspaper had been printed for 18 years, had said no to printing it starting 2021 for no reason; the fax was signed by Vyacheslav Shakhlevich, chief of the printing house.\nThe United Mass Media requested Shakhlevich, the Brest City and Regional Executive Committees, and the Ministry of Information to make possible to change the decision that created \"troubles for the well liked private regional publication.\" Chief of the Belarusian Association of Journalists Andrei Bastunets said that the troubles made to Brestskaya Gazeta support the government' pressure on the regional news media, as \"the fact that this is happening at the level of economic objects should make anyone foolish.\"\nTo stay away from punishment for not made transportation, it was chosen in time to give up on Belposhta's (Belpost (), Belarusian postal service) subscription services for the first part of 2021. On January 19, 2021, it became known that Brestskaya Gazeta has stopped to be made for now. All printing houses in Belarus had made decisions not to print the newspaper.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brest%2C_Belarus","surface_form":"Brest","offset":60},{"uri":"Belarus","surface_form":"Belarus","offset":67},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":174},{"uri":"Belarusian_language","surface_form":"Belarusian","offset":215},{"uri":"2020_Belarusian_protests","surface_form":"2020 Belarusian protests","offset":257},{"uri":"2020_Belarusian_presidential_election","surface_form":"2020 Belarusian presidential election","offset":286},{"uri":"Belarusian_Association_of_Journalists","surface_form":"Belarusian Association of Journalists","offset":474},{"uri":"TUT.BY","surface_form":"TUT.BY","offset":559},{"uri":"Fax","surface_form":"fax","offset":794},{"uri":"Printing_house","surface_form":"printing house","offset":849},{"uri":"Postal_Service","surface_form":"postal service","offset":1511},{"uri":"Subscription","surface_form":"subscription services","offset":1527}]}
