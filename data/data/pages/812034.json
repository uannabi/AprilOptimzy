However, our title is what people use most.\nThey are the mountain ranges which stretch along the West Coast of North America from Alaska south to Central Mexico.\nThe Pacific Coast Ranges are part of the North American Cordillera. Broadly speaking, the coastal ranges include the mountains and basins down the Pacific coast from Canada to Mexico. That does not include the Rocky Mountains and their basins: they are included in the North American Cordillera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":82},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":154},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"North America","offset":208},{"uri":"Alaska","surface_form":"Alaska","offset":227},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":251},{"uri":"North_American_Cordillera","surface_form":"North American Cordillera","offset":300},{"uri":"Basin_(geology)","surface_form":"basins","offset":390},{"uri":"Pacific_coast","surface_form":"Pacific coast","offset":406},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":425},{"uri":"Rocky_Mountains","surface_form":"Rocky Mountains","offset":469},{"uri":"North_American_Cordillera","surface_form":"North American Cordillera","offset":528}]}
