{"id":812398,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability","text":"=\"preserve\">In probability theory, conditional probability is the probability of an event occuring, given that another event has occurred. Usually this is written as formula_1. This is read as \"probabilty of A given B\". The two events need not be related. They also need not occur at the same time. In the most general case,\nformula_1\nExpressed in words: The conditional probablility of A occurring given B is the probabiliy of both events occurring, divided by the probability of B occurring. As a division by zero is not defined, the probability of B occurring must not be zero.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
