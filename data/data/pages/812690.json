{"id":812690,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Bourdonnais","text":"Louis-Charles Mah\u00E9 de La Bourdonnais (1795\u20131840) was probably the world's best chess player around 1830. Born in R\u00E9union, he followed Deschapelles as the top professional at the \"Caf\u00E9 de la R\u00E9gence\", Paris.\nLa Bourdonnais beat the British player Alexander McDonnell, who was the son of a doctor in Dublin. At this time McDonnell was based in London, and had taken chess lessons from William Lewis, the top London professional at the time. The two matches between La Bourdonnais and McDonnell were played at the \"Caf\u00E9 de la R\u00E9gence\" in 1834. This series was a total of 85 games.\nBoth men died soon afterwards, La Bourdonnais of dropsy.\nHe died penniless in London in December 1840. He was forced to sell his possessions, including his clothes, to pay his creditors. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chess","surface_form":"chess","offset":79},{"uri":"R%C3%A9union","surface_form":"R\u00E9union","offset":113},{"uri":"Deschapelles","surface_form":"Deschapelles","offset":134},{"uri":"Caf%C3%A9_de_la_R%C3%A9gence","surface_form":"Caf\u00E9 de la R\u00E9gence","offset":179},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":200},{"uri":"Alexander_McDonnell","surface_form":"Alexander McDonnell","offset":246},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":298},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":342},{"uri":"William_Lewi","surface_form":"William Lewi","offset":383},{"uri":"Dropsy","surface_form":"dropsy","offset":627},{"uri":"Kensal_Green","surface_form":"Kensal Green","offset":781},{"uri":"Cemetery","surface_form":"Cemetery","offset":794}]}
