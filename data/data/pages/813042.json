{"id":813042,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Liberia","text":"e=\"preserve\">Liberia is a country in West Africa. White Americans made the American Colonization Society and bought the land in 1822. They didn't want black people who were not slaves to be in the United States. So they took some of them to Liberia. At the start of the American Civil War (in the 1860s) about 12,000 freed slaves lived there.\nThe name of the country means \"Land of the Free\" in Latin. Liberia gained its independence on July 26, 1847. Joseph Jenkins Roberts was the first president of Liberia. European states were quick to recognize Liberia as a state, but it took the US until 1862 to do so. Many of the black people who were sent to Liberia were missionaries. Its official language today is English because of this history.\nIn the 1990s and in the early 2000s, two civil wars badly affected the country.\nThe country's constitution is similar to that of the United States. In the 2017 elections, George Weah became the twenty-fifth President of Liberia. The President before Weah was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first African female president.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Liberia","surface_form":"Liberia","offset":13},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":151},{"uri":"Slavery_in_the_United_States","surface_form":"slaves","offset":177},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":197},{"uri":"American_Civil_War","surface_form":"American Civil War","offset":270},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":395},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independence","offset":421},{"uri":"July_26","surface_form":"July 26","offset":437},{"uri":"1847","surface_form":"1847","offset":446},{"uri":"Joseph_Jenkins_Roberts","surface_form":"Joseph Jenkins Roberts","offset":452},{"uri":"Black_people","surface_form":"black people","offset":623},{"uri":"Missionary","surface_form":"missionaries","offset":666},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":711},{"uri":"Liberia_civil_wars","surface_form":"civil wars","offset":785},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"constitution","offset":838},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":877},{"uri":"2017","surface_form":"2017","offset":899},{"uri":"George_Weah","surface_form":"George Weah","offset":915},{"uri":"President_of_Liberia","surface_form":"President of Liberia","offset":951},{"uri":"President_of_Liberia","surface_form":"President","offset":977},{"uri":"Ellen_Johnson_Sirleaf","surface_form":"Ellen Johnson Sirleaf","offset":1003}]}
