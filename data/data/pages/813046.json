{"id":813046,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump","text":"Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, was impeached for a second time by the United States House of Representatives on January 13, 2021. This made Trump the only president to be impeached twice.\nBackground.\nAfter the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters on January 6, 2021, many government officials said that Trump had told them to do it. Because of this, Members of Congress from both the Democratic Party wanted to remove Trump from his office as President of the United States. Most Republicans still support the President.\nTwenty-fifth amendment.\nFirstly, they wanted Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be used by Vice President Mike Pence, which would remove office from Trump straight away. If he didn't do this, they said they would impeach him in the House of Representatives and convict him in the Senate instead. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment was also talked about.\nImpeachment plans.\nAs of January 8, Democrats planned to push for an impeachment resolution on January 11. By late January 9, it was said that Pence had not ruled out that he might use the 25th Amendment. On January 11, an Article of Impeachment saying that Trump caused the \"lawless action at the Capitol\" began in the United States House of Representatives.\nOn January 13, the House voted to impeach Trump.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":0},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":23},{"uri":"Impeached","surface_form":"impeached","offset":59},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":94},{"uri":"2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol","surface_form":"2021 storming of the United States Capitol","offset":234},{"uri":"Donald_Trump","surface_form":"Donald Trump","offset":280},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":331},{"uri":"United_States_Congress","surface_form":"Members of Congress","offset":409},{"uri":"Democratic_Party_(United_States)","surface_form":"Democratic","offset":443},{"uri":"Political_office","surface_form":"office","offset":492},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":502},{"uri":"Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution","offset":642},{"uri":"Vice_President_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"Vice President","offset":713},{"uri":"Mike_Pence","surface_form":"Mike Pence","offset":728},{"uri":"Impeachment","surface_form":"impeach","offset":835},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"House of Representatives","offset":854},{"uri":"Conviction","surface_form":"convict","offset":883},{"uri":"United_States_Senate","surface_form":"Senate","offset":902},{"uri":"Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","surface_form":"Fourteenth Amendment","offset":935},{"uri":"Impeachment","surface_form":"impeachment","offset":1048},{"uri":"United_States_House_of_Representatives","surface_form":"United States House of Representatives","offset":1299}]}
