{"id":813097,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_QR322","text":"=\"preserve\">2001 QR322 is a minor planet and the first Neptune trojan discovered on 21 August 2001, by the Deep Ecliptic Survey at the Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile. It orbits ahead of Neptune at its L4 Lagrangian point.\nOther Neptune trojans have been discovered since. A study by American astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo from the Carnegie Institution suggests that Neptune could possibly have twenty times more trojans than Jupiter.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Small_solar_system_body","surface_form":"minor planet","offset":28},{"uri":"Neptune_Trojan","surface_form":"Neptune trojan","offset":55},{"uri":"Deep_Ecliptic_Survey","surface_form":"Deep Ecliptic Survey","offset":107},{"uri":"Cerro_Tololo_Observatory","surface_form":"Cerro Tololo Observatory","offset":135},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":163},{"uri":"Lagrange_point","surface_form":"Lagrangian point","offset":207},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott Sheppard","offset":307},{"uri":"Chad_Trujillo","surface_form":"Chad Trujillo","offset":326},{"uri":"Carnegie_Institution_for_Science","surface_form":"Carnegie Institution","offset":349},{"uri":"Neptune","surface_form":"Neptune","offset":384},{"uri":"Jupiter","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":443}]}
