{"id":813101,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_June_10%2C_2021","text":"e=\"preserve\">An annular solar eclipse will occur on June 10, 2021. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, covering the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like a ring. An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide.\nThis eclipse is notable for the fact that the path of annularity will pass over the North Pole, the only such eclipse in the 21st century.\nWhile the eclipse is visible primarily in northern Canada, in Greenland and in north of Russian Far East, in the northeastern United States and Canada, the sun will be partially eclipsed at sunrise, which will be between 5 and 6 A.M.
