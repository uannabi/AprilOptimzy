{"id":813224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyke_(slang)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term \"dyke\" is a slang term. It is used as a noun for lesbians. It is also used as an adjective for things related to lesbianism. It began as a homophobic and misogynistic term for a masculine or butch girl or woman.\nThe origin of the term \"dyke\" is obscure. Many theories have come out. Most theories tell that \"dyke\" comes off the word \"bulldyke\", which has a similar meaning.\nFrom the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, \"dike\" had been American slang for the well-dressed man. \"Diked out\" and \"out on the dike\" meant a young man was in his best clothes.\nThe word \"dyke\" was used in the 1950s as a derogatory term for lesbians by straight people. But it was also used by lesbians of higher social status to mean crude and rough-bar lesbians.\nFacebook controversy.\nFacebook censored use of the word \"dyke\" as \"abusive content\" in June 2017 on its website. The decision triggered a Change.org protest petition created by the \"Listening 2 Lesbians\" collective. It was signed by 7,247 supporters.\nDyke Marches have become popular gay pride events in the United States and Canada. They also happen in Europe, including London and Berlin, as well as across Mexico.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":34},{"uri":"Noun","surface_form":"noun","offset":62},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":71},{"uri":"Adjective","surface_form":"adjective","offset":103},{"uri":"Women_who_have_sex_with_women","surface_form":"lesbianism","offset":135},{"uri":"Homophobia","surface_form":"homophobic","offset":161},{"uri":"Misogyny","surface_form":"misogynistic","offset":176},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":465},{"uri":"Pejorative","surface_form":"derogatory term","offset":626},{"uri":"Lesbian","surface_form":"lesbian","offset":646},{"uri":"Heterosexuality","surface_form":"straight people","offset":658},{"uri":"Facebook","surface_form":"Facebook","offset":792},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":874},{"uri":"Change.org","surface_form":"Change.org","offset":908},{"uri":"Dyke_March","surface_form":"Dyke March","offset":1021},{"uri":"Gay_pride","surface_form":"gay pride","offset":1054},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1096},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1124},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":1142},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":1153},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1179}]}
