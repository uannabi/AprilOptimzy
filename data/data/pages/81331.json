{"id":81331,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dia_(moon)","text":"Dia (S/2000 J 11) ls the second-outermost prograde non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000.\nDia is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 12,555,000\u00A0km in 287 days, at an inclination of 28\u00B0 (to Jupiter's equator), and with an orbital eccentricity of 0.248.\nThe moon is included in the Himalia group. After discovery it was lost for ten years because the orbit was poorly known. Recovery allowed much better precision.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prograde_and_retrograde_motion","surface_form":"prograde","offset":42},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":55},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":73},{"uri":"University_of_Hawaii","surface_form":"University of Hawaii","offset":129},{"uri":"Scott_S._Sheppard","surface_form":"Scott S.
