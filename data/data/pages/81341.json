{"id":81341,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinope_(moon)","text":"Sinope is a non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory in 1914, and is named after Sinope of Greek mythology.\nSinope did not get its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as. It was sometimes called \"Hades\" between 1955 and 1975.\nSinope was the farthest known moon of Jupiter until the discovery of Megaclite in 2000. The farthest moon of Jupiter now known is.\nOrbit.\nSinope orbits Jupiter on a high eccentricity and high inclination retrograde orbit. The orbital elements are as of January 2000. They are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations. It is often believed to belong to the Pasipha\u00EB group. However, given its mean inclination and different colour, Sinope could be also an independent object, captured independently, unrelated to the collision and break-up at the origin of the group. The diagram illustrates Sinope's orbital elements in relation to other moons of the group.\nPhysical characteristics.\nSinope has an estimated diameter of 38\u00A0km (assuming an albedo of 0.04) The moon is red unlike Pasiphae which is grey.\nIts infrared spectrum is similar to D-type asteroids also different from Pasiphae. These dissimilarities of the physical parameters suggest a different origin from the core members of the group.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":16},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":34},{"uri":"Seth_Barnes_Nicholson","surface_form":"Seth Barnes Nicholson","offset":59},{"uri":"Lick_Observatory","surface_form":"Lick Observatory","offset":84},{"uri":"Sinope_(mythology)","surface_form":"Sinope","offset":129},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":139},{"uri":"Hades","surface_form":"Hades","offset":266},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":326},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":334},{"uri":"Megaclite_(moon)","surface_form":"Megaclite","offset":365},{"uri":"Solar","surface_form":"Solar","offset":594},{"uri":"Pasipha%C3%AB_group","surface_form":"Pasipha\u00EB group","offset":667},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":1116},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_spectrum","surface_form":"spectrum","offset":1125},{"uri":"D-type_asteroid","surface_form":"D-type asteroid","offset":1148}]}
