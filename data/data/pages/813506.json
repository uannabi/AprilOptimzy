{"id":813506,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theckumchery_Karthakal","text":"Theckumchery Karthakal (also known as Theckumchery Mana) were members of an Illathu Nair aristocratic clan, which ruled a small portion of the then Vadakumkoor kingdom. Ramamangalam, Memuri and Thammanimattom were under their rule from 14th century AD until the 18th century. Unlike the other aristocratic Nair factions of North and Central Kerala who are descended from the N\u0101gas (N\u0101ga Scynthians), the Theckumchery Mana were of Embranthiri (Tulu Brahmin) origin.\nThe Theckumchery Karthas were originally Embranthiri Brahmins belonging to Tulu lineage who migrated from Tulu Nad near Udupi to Kerala with many other families following Madhavacharya in the 14th century. They settled in Ramamangalam (which was a great cultural center during that time).\nKerala, they were gradually assimilated into the Illathu Nair caste, which was the major aristocratic caste in Travancore region. As they amassed power, Samanthan status as well as the aristocratic title of \"Kartha\" (meaning Lord in Malayalam) were bestowed upon them.\nTheckumchery Mana became extinct in the 18th century when Ainatu Valayil Mathu from Ainatu Valayil family married the Tamburatty without the consent of their parents. This infuriated her brothers and they tried to attack his brother Ainatu Valayil Uthup Avargal. Uthup and his family thus migrated to Palai and changed their name from Valayil to Valiyil. The Tamburatty's brothers cut all relations with the Theckumchery Kartha and established other Manas. Thus Theckumchery Mana was abandoned and all the wealth was transferred to Ainatu Valayil family. The Aiantu Valayil family added the name Theckumchery and formed Ainatu Theckumchery Valayil for the remembrance of the Mana.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
