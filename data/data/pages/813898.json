{"id":813898,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIL-API","text":"The XIL API standardizes the interface between test hardware and test software.\nSince 1998 ASAM (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) has been working on uniform standards for testing electronic automotive components. Today, the organization has over 250 members worldwide.\nASAMS definition of the XIL standard was highly pushed by the automotive sector. More and more ECUs (Energy Control Units) control numerous electronic circuits, some of which control safety-critical functions. The need for testing is increasing fast.\nHistory.\nThe first release of ASAM HIL 1.0.0 was in June 2009. Maintenance releases 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 have been launched in February 2011 and February 2012. SOURCE The first releases focused on the description of test bench functionality and port-based communication between the test bench and the test automation system.\nCross tests have been carried out in June 2012 and February 2013 based on ASAM HIL 1.0.2 by the major HIL system vendors dSPACE GmbH, ETAS GmbH, National Instruments Corporation, TraceTronic GmbH and Vector Informatik GmbH. These tests demonstrated that test systems and test automation software using the HIL API are able to communicate without integration efforts. The few minor functional deficits that occurred due to a standard misinterpretation were identified and fixed with the next release.\nASAM XIL 2.0.0 was released in October 2013 and marks a major milestone in the further development of the standard. A framework was introduced to the standard, which is completely new and contains broadly extended functionality such as logging of variables and mapping of units, data types or variable identifiers as well as managing of ports already known from ASAM HIL 1.0.2. The ports themselves were extended slightly with respect to missing functionality in the previous standard version, such as configuration and initialization. In order to give test developers standardized access to CAN busses, the Network Port was added to the standard.\nASAM cooperated with the ITEA2-funded project Modelisar during the development of the ASAM XIL API 2.0 project. As a result, part of the ASAM XIL standard has been re-published as ASAM XIL-MA with the title \"Generic Simulator Interface for Simulation Model Access\". Within the group of Modelica FMI (functional mock-up interfaces) standards, ASAM XIL-MA takes the position of functional mock-up interfaces for applications.\nThe release 2.1.0 introduced further improvements that members reported to ASAM as a result of the first implementations of the major release 2.0.0. Simulations can now be paused, real-time scripts can be executed for test stimulation, signal descriptions can be parameterized, timestamping has been improved e.g. for data capturing and signal generation, user-defined events for data capturing has been introduced and concurrent access to variables from different models is now possible. The DiagPort has been redesigned and cleaned up to ease its implementation.\nAbout XIL.\nThe XIL Model Access port (MAPort) is a unified communication acces port for testing and simulation tools. This port can be used independent from the type or manufacturer of the equipment.\nDuring modern development cycles of controllers, the following simulations are used.\n\u2022 MIL (model-in-the-loop): Creation of a model-based controllers inside of a simulation environment based on the specification.\n\u2022 SIL (software-in-the-loop): The model is transferred into source courde (C, C++, Python, etc.) and is running against the same model. This transfer can be done manualy or (semi-) automatic.\n\u2022 HIL (hardware-in-the-loop): The source code is running on the real controller hardware, the controller itself is connected to a real-time controller.\n\u2022 Testbay or field application: Final tests are done with the real devices in the field.\nEach stage of simulation (MIL, SIL, HIL) can be done with several types of software. For model design Matlab Simulink, Python, PSpice,\u2026 could be used. If you are switching from a pure virtual environment (MIL, SIL) to testing with real hardware additional hardware devices have to be used. For slow and simple simulation this could be a traditional Siemens SPS. For more complicated setups you can use dedicated Realtime Simulators like dSpace Autobox, Typhoon HIL, Micronova Nova Cards or Relais cards (Bachmann, W&T, etc.).\nTo enable automatic testing of the setup with the same tools and the same testcases independent of the setup (SIL, HIL, MIL) a unified access to the setup is needed. Common tools for testautomation could be Micronova AXAM, Piketech TPT, ECUtest or others.\nAdditonal driving companies for ASAM XIL are several automotive oriented companies with focusing on tests: ETAS, dSpace and Vector.\nHardware/Software supporting XIL \u2022.\nThis is made possible by the XIL API standard, which ASAM published in 2013 as the successor to the HIL API standard. This is a standard for communication between the test automation software used in each case - such as EXAM from Micronova or ECU-TEST from Tracetronic - and the components of an HIL system. It is a common language, so to speak, thanks to which it is not necessary to know which specific configuration commands are to be used for the SMART MCM components in HIL, for example, when programming the test cases.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
