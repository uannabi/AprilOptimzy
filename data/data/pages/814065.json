His father was a wealthy farmer. But he wanted to do martial arts and be a samurai. So he made an effort to practice swordfighting.\nChildhood.\nAs a child, he was a very naughty boy. Also he was a smart boy.\nWhen he was 11 years old, he started to work in the dry goods dealer (Ito Gofukuten). But he quarreled with the leader for a trivial matter and walked back about 40 kilometers to his house. He was so stubborn that he wouldn\u2019t return to the shop even if his family persuaded him.\nNext, he started to sell the medicines (Ishida Sanyaku).\nShinsengumi.\nThe Shinsengumi, or \"newly selected troops,\" protected the Shogun in the last years before the Meiji Restoration.\nShinsengumi.\nHijikata met Isami Kondo when he was 25 years old. He joined Shieikan which Isami Kondo ran. After that, he applied for the Roshigumi to protect Tokugawa Iemochi, the 14th Shogun of the Edo Shogunate. And he went to Kyoto with members of Shieikan.
