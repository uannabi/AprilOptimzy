Karl Jahn and his companions among the prisoners were sausage craftspeople in Germany. The Japanese bureaucracy made these craftspeople reveal the secret recipe.

Actually that place was fingered as one of the rare habitats of migratory birds such as plover and snipe. Water pollution and odor,however, got more acute because of illegal waste dumping by local residents. \u200BSaburo Morita\u200Bwho was a newspaper deliverer at that time started removing liters in order to clean up the tidal flat by himself. No one would support his behavior at first. Eventually regional collaborators gathered one after another for the sake of helping him. Their activity restored mud flat.\nThis tidal flat was entered into \u200BRamsar Convention \u200Bin 1993. Now all of the elementary school students in Narashino have been to the tidaland at least once as off-campus learning.

There is even an observatory which provides people with guidance on that area showing slides of views.\nElementary & Junior high school students \u00A0 \u00A0 for free\nHigh school students or older\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 380 yen\nCelebrities.\nDaiki Arioka\u200B: a member of \u201CHey Say Jump\u201D(one of the Johnny\u2019s)\nKazuya Fukuura\u200B: a former professional baseball player (belonged to Chiba Lotte Marines)\nDaichi Suzuki\u200B: a former professional swimmer (100-meter backstroke gold medalist Seoul Olympic held in 1988)\nLe P\u00E2tissier Yokoyama.\nIn 2001, the first shop was opened in Yatsu (the second store in Okubo).
