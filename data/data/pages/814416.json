For example, 593 is made up of 5 flats (500), 9 rods (90), and 3 units (3). Addition and subtraction can be learned by adding or taking away blocks.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":62},{"uri":"Arithmetic","surface_form":"arithmetic","offset":82},{"uri":"Place_value","surface_form":"place value","offset":97},{"uri":"Zolt%C3%A1n_P%C3%A1l_Dienes","surface_form":"Zolt\u00E1n P\u00E1l Dienes","offset":219},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"Addition","offset":473},{"uri":"Subtraction","surface_form":"subtraction","offset":486}]}
