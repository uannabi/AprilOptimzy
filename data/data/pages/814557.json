Christianity in these countries and communities, dates back to the ancient African (East African-Horn African) Kingdom of Aksum, when King Ezana first converted to the faith and later on became the official religion of his kingdom and the Ethiopian Empire. Eastern Christianity is the main Christian cultural tradition of these countries and communities.\nThere are several different branches of Christianity in the Ethiopian and Eritrean communities, and can be broken down into several denominations. The largest and oldest branch of Christianity in Ethiopia and Eritrea are the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, a group of culturally and theologically related Oriental Orthodox churches. The second largest Christian branch in Ethiopia and Eritrea is P'ent'ay (Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism), a grouping of several Evangelical Protestant denominations.
