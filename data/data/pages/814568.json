{"id":814568,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing","text":"=\"preserve\">With \"batch processing,\" a number of tasks (\"jobs)\" are collected together over a set period of time. The jobs are then loaded into a computer system (known as a \"job queue)\" and processed all at once (in a \"batch)\". Once the batch processing starts, no user interaction is needed. This type of processing can only be done where there are no timing constraints, i.e. files don't need to be updated immediately or a response from the computer is not needed straight away.\nA big advantage of batch processing is that the jobs can be processed when the computer system is less busy (e.g. overnight), so the use of resources is being optimized. Areas where batch processing is used include billing systems (e.g. electricity, gas, water and telephone), payroll systems and processing of bank cheques.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
