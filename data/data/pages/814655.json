{"id":814655,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Golden_Glove","text":"The Premier League Golden Glove is an association football award. It is given to the goalkeeper who has kept the most clean sheets in a Premier League season. In association football, a clean sheet is given to a team's defence or goalkeeper if they prevent their opponents from scoring any goals during a match. For sponsorship reasons, it has been referred to as the Barclays Golden Glove since it was created for the 2004\u201305 season until the 2015\u201316 season. Since the 2017\u201318 season, it is known as the Cadbury Golden Glove.\nIn 2005, the first Premier League Golden Glove was awarded to Petr \u010Cech of Chelsea. \u010Cech's 24 clean sheets in a single season remains the current record. Since 2005, \u010Cech and Joe Hart have won the award the most amout of times, with 4 each. Pepe Reina was the first goalkeeper to win the award back-to-back, winning it in 3 consecutive seasons between 2005 and 2008. Joe Hart later repeated the achievement with Manchester City between 2010 and 2013.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Edwin van der Sar surpassed \u010Cech's previous record of 10 consecutive clean sheets by reaching 14. During his streak, Van der Sar went 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal. In the process, he broke both \u010Cech's Premier League record (1,025 minutes), Steve Death's Football League record (1,103 minutes) and also the all-time league record in Britain (1,155 minutes) for most consecutive scoreless minutes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Association_football","surface_form":"association football","offset":38},{"uri":"Goalkeeper","surface_form":"goalkeeper","offset":85},{"uri":"Shutout","surface_form":"clean sheets","offset":118},{"uri":"Premier_League","surface_form":"Premier League","offset":136},{"uri":"Barclays","surface_form":"Barclays","offset":368},{"uri":"2004%E2%80%9305_FA_Premier_League","surface_form":"2004\u201305 season","offset":419},{"uri":"2015%E2%80%9316_Premier_League","surface_form":"2015\u201316 season","offset":444},{"uri":"2017%E2%80%9318_Premier_League","surface_form":"2017\u201318 season","offset":470},{"uri":"Cadbury","surface_form":"Cadbury","offset":505},{"uri":"Petr_%C4%8Cech","surface_form":"Petr \u010Cech","offset":589},{"uri":"Chelse_F.C.","surface_form":"Chelsea","offset":602},{"uri":"Joe_Hart","surface_form":"Joe Hart","offset":702},{"uri":"Pepe_Reina","surface_form":"Pepe Reina","offset":768},{"uri":"2008%E2%80%9309_Premier_League","surface_form":"2008\u201309 season","offset":989},{"uri":"Edwin_van_der_Sar","surface_form":"Edwin van der Sar","offset":1005},{"uri":"Steve_Death","surface_form":"Steve Death","offset":1255}]}
