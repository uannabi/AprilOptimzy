Players do not have to pay to play the game. Most items and Warframes can be acquired without paying.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nintendo_Switch","surface_form":"Nintendo Switch","offset":154},{"uri":"PlayStation_4","surface_form":"PlayStation 4","offset":171},{"uri":"PlayStation_5","surface_form":"PlayStation 5","offset":186},{"uri":"Xbox_One","surface_form":"Xbox One","offset":201},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"the personal computer","offset":215}]}
