When the Ronettes were added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, Bennett was too fraile to perform, and only said a few words \"I would just like to say, thank you very much for giving us this award. I'm Estelle of the Ronettes, thank you\".\nBennett died on February 11, 2009 at the age of 67 from colon cancer.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Singing","surface_form":"singer","offset":68},{"uri":"The_Ronettes","surface_form":"the Ronettes","offset":96},{"uri":"Ronnie_Spector","surface_form":"Ronnie Bennett","offset":125},{"uri":"Nedra_Talley","surface_form":"Nedra Talley","offset":158},{"uri":"Anorexia","surface_form":"anorexia","offset":223},{"uri":"Schizophrenia","surface_form":"schizophrenia","offset":236},{"uri":"Homelessness","surface_form":"homeless","offset":259},{"uri":"Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame","surface_form":"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame","offset":316},{"uri":"Colon_cancer","surface_form":"colon cancer","offset":583}]}
