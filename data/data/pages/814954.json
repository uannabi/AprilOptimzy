{"id":814954,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.org","text":"The domain name org is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) of the Domain Name System (DNS) used in the Internet. The name is truncated from \"organization\". It was one of the original domains established in 1985, and has been operated by the Public Interest Registry since 2003. The domain was originally intended for non-profit entities, but this restriction was removed in August 2019.\nIn November 2019, the Public Interest Registry (PIR) was to be sold by the Internet Society to shell company Ethos Capital for US$1.135 billion. However, this move was criticized by non-profits and various digital rights groups on concerns that Ethos Capital, a private equity firm, would raise fees or censor the domain. The sale was blocked by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in April 2020 on the basis that transfer of control of the domain to the private equity firm would create \"unacceptable uncertainty\" for non-profits that relied on the org domain.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["top level domain"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Generic_top-level_domain","surface_form":"generic top-level domain","offset":25},{"uri":"Domain_Name_System","surface_form":"Domain Name System","offset":64},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":101},{"uri":"ICANN","surface_form":"Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)","offset":731}]}
