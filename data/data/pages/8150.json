{"id":8150,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design","text":"=\"preserve\">Design is a visual look or a shape given to a certain object, in order to make it more attractive, make it more comfortable or to improve another characteristic. Designers use tools from geometry and art. Design is sometimes divided to sub-categories: graphic design, buildings and nature design, consumer goods design.\nDesign is also a concept used to create an object (virtual or not).\nDesign is picturing things using the imagination; as to using perception or memory.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":199},{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":212},{"uri":"Graphic_design","surface_form":"graphic design","offset":264},{"uri":"Buildings_and_nature_design","surface_form":"buildings and nature design","offset":280},{"uri":"Consumer_goods_design","surface_form":"consumer goods design","offset":309},{"uri":"Concept","surface_form":"concept","offset":349}]}
