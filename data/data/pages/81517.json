{"id":81517,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daspletosaurus","text":"\"Daspletosaurus\" (\"frightful lizard\") was a tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that was 26-33 feet (8-10 m) long and weighed perhaps 2-3 tons (3000 kg).\nIt had tiny horns behind its eyes and its arms were a bit longer than those of \"T. rex\". It may have been an ancestor of \"Tyrannosaurus\". This bipedal meat-eater lived in marshes by streams in what is now Alberta, Canada, during the Upper Cretaceous period, 76-72 million years ago. It may have preyed upon Triceratops. It was named by D.A. Russell in 1970. The type species is \"D. torosus\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tyrannosauridae","surface_form":"tyrannosaurid","offset":44},{"uri":"Theropoda","surface_form":"theropod","offset":58},{"uri":"Dinosaur","surface_form":"dinosaur","offset":67},{"uri":"T._rex","surface_form":"T. rex","offset":230},{"uri":"Tyrannosaurus","surface_form":"Tyrannosaurus","offset":272},{"uri":"Meat","surface_form":"meat","offset":301},{"uri":"Marsh","surface_form":"marsh","offset":321},{"uri":"Stream","surface_form":"stream","offset":332},{"uri":"Alberta","surface_form":"Alberta","offset":355},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":364},{"uri":"Upper_Cretaceous","surface_form":"Upper Cretaceous","offset":383},{"uri":"Triceratops","surface_form":"Triceratops","offset":457}]}
