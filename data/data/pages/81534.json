{"id":81534,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitte_(locality)","text":"Mitte was the most central locality of Berlin (\"Mitte\" is German for centre). It was set up in 1920, when Gro\u00DF-Berlin was set up, and in 2001 it was joined with Wedding and Tiergarten to make a new borough called Bezirk Mitte.\nMitte was in East Berlin, and had a lot of Berlin's historic sites. The Pergamon Museum, Unter den Linden and the Brandenburg Gate were in Mitte.\nIn 2001 Mitte was joined with two boroughs from West Berlin. This helped to break down the idea of a divided city, and put the important tourist centre of Berlin under one local government.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Locality","surface_form":"locality","offset":27},{"uri":"Berlin","surface_form":"Berlin","offset":39},{"uri":"Gro%C3%9F-Berlin","surface_form":"Gro\u00DF-Berlin","offset":106},{"uri":"Bezirk_Mitte","surface_form":"Bezirk Mitte","offset":213},{"uri":"East_Berlin","surface_form":"East Berlin","offset":240},{"uri":"Pergamon_Museum","surface_form":"Pergamon Museum","offset":299},{"uri":"Unter_den_Linden","surface_form":"Unter den Linden","offset":316},{"uri":"Brandenburg_Gate","surface_form":"Brandenburg Gate","offset":341},{"uri":"West_Berlin","surface_form":"West Berlin","offset":421},{"uri":"Berlin_Wall","surface_form":"divided city","offset":474}]}
