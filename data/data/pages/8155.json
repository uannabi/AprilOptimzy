It was called the Christian Mission to start with, but in 1878, the name was changed. The Booths came from a Methodist tradition, but today the teachings of the movement are mainstream Protestant. They focus on preaching, and on helping those in need. They also actively help in disaster relief.\nOverview.\nThe Salvation Army operates in over 100 countries today. Its members devote themselves to teaching Christian morals, helping those in need, like the homeless, the sick, the poor, and others. It operates facilities like shelters, orphanages, and a, and offers Sunday church services. It is one of the largest charitable organisations in the world, which means that it relies on people to give it money to use.\nEurovision Song Contest.\nPeople from theSwiss branch of the Salvavion army qualified for the Eurovidion Song Contest, 2013 in Malm\u00F6.

They didn't qualify for the final round, though.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Protestantism","surface_form":"Protestant","offset":37},{"uri":"Christian","surface_form":"Christian","offset":48},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":129},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":137},{"uri":"Methodism","surface_form":"Methodist","offset":263},{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"countries","offset":500},{"uri":"Moral","surface_form":"moral","offset":569},{"uri":"Homelessness","surface_form":"homeless","offset":609},{"uri":"Illness","surface_form":"sick","offset":623},{"uri":"Poor","surface_form":"poor","offset":633},{"uri":"Shelter","surface_form":"shelter","offset":679},{"uri":"Orphanage","surface_form":"orphanage","offset":689},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":726},{"uri":"People","surface_form":"people","offset":837},{"uri":"Eurovision_Song_Contest","surface_form":"Eurovidion Song Contest","offset":962},{"uri":"Malm%C3%B6","surface_form":"Malm\u00F6","offset":995},{"uri":"Takasa","surface_form":"Takasa","offset":1104},{"uri":"Uniform","surface_form":"uniforms","offset":1164}]}
