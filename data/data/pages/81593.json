{"id":81593,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden","text":"e=\"preserve\">Baden is a historical state in south-west Germany.\nThe Margraviate of Baden () was made in 1112. From 1190 to 1771, Baden was broken up into different smaller states. When the Holy Roman Empire ended in 1806, the Margraviate of Baden became the larger and more powerful Grand Duchy of Baden (). After World War I ended in 1918, the monarchy in Baden ended so Baden became a republic.\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, Baden was cut in half: the north half became part of W\u00FCrttemberg-Baden and the south half became South Baden. South Baden changed its name to \"Baden\" in 1947. Baden was one of the original states of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1952, it joined with W\u00FCrttemberg-Baden and W\u00FCrttemberg-Hohenzollern to make the state of Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":55},{"uri":"Margraviate_of_Baden","surface_form":"Margraviate of Baden","offset":68},{"uri":"1112","surface_form":"1112","offset":104},{"uri":"1190","surface_form":"1190","offset":115},{"uri":"1771","surface_form":"1771","offset":123},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":189},{"uri":"1806","surface_form":"1806","offset":216},{"uri":"Grand_Duchy_of_Baden","surface_form":"Grand Duchy of Baden","offset":283},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":314},{"uri":"1918","surface_form":"1918","offset":335},{"uri":"Monarchy","surface_form":"monarchy","offset":345},{"uri":"Republic_of_Baden","surface_form":"republic","offset":387},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":403},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":425},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrttemberg-Baden","surface_form":"W\u00FCrttemberg-Baden","offset":484},{"uri":"South_Baden","surface_form":"South Baden","offset":528},{"uri":"Federal_Republic_of_Germany","surface_form":"Federal Republic of Germany","offset":634},{"uri":"1952","surface_form":"1952","offset":666},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrttemberg-Baden","surface_form":"W\u00FCrttemberg-Baden","offset":687},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrttemberg-Hohenzollern","surface_form":"W\u00FCrttemberg-Hohenzollern","offset":709},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"state","offset":746},{"uri":"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg","surface_form":"Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg","offset":755}]}
