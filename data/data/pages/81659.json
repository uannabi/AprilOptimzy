{"id":81659,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_cantata","text":"e=\"preserve\">A Passion cantata is a cantata. The cantata takes its theme from the Passion of Jesus Christ, in other words his suffering until his death at the cross. Larger cantatas with this theme are known as oratorios.\nToday, most of them are performed in the week before Easter.\nEnglish.\nIn the English repertoire, the two classics are \"The Crucifixion\" (1887) by Sir John Stainer and \"Olivet to Calvary\" (1904) by John Henry Maunder. Other works include Sir Arthur Somervell's \"The Passion of Christ\" (1914), Charles Wood's \"St. Mark Passion\" (1921) and Eric Thiman's \"The Last Supper\" (1930).\nGerman.\nThe most famous Passion cantatas are probably the two composed by Johann Sebastian Bach: the \"St John Passion\" (1724) and the \"St Matthew Passion\" (1727). A t first it was believed, St Luke Passion (1730) was also written by him. Now it is thought that he simply rearranged an earlier work.\nLatin.\nOne notable work in Latin is Arvo P\u00E4rt's \"Passio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi secundum Joannem\" (\"The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to John\") of 1982.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cantata","surface_form":"cantata","offset":36},{"uri":"Jesus_Christ","surface_form":"Jesus Christ","offset":93},{"uri":"Oratorio","surface_form":"oratorio","offset":211},{"uri":"Easter","surface_form":"Easter","offset":275},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":299},{"uri":"The_Crucifixion_(Stainer)","surface_form":"The Crucifixion","offset":341},{"uri":"1887","surface_form":"1887","offset":359},{"uri":"John_Stainer","surface_form":"Sir John Stainer","offset":368},{"uri":"Olivet_to_Calvary","surface_form":"Olivet to Calvary","offset":390},{"uri":"1904","surface_form":"1904","offset":410},{"uri":"John_Henry_Maunder","surface_form":"John Henry Maunder","offset":419},{"uri":"Arthur_Somervell","surface_form":"Sir Arthur Somervell","offset":459},{"uri":"1914","surface_form":"1914","offset":507},{"uri":"Charles_Wood","surface_form":"Charles Wood","offset":514},{"uri":"St._Mark_Passion_(Wood)","surface_form":"St. Mark Passion","offset":530},{"uri":"1921","surface_form":"1921","offset":549},{"uri":"Eric_Thiman","surface_form":"Eric Thiman","offset":559},{"uri":"1930","surface_form":"1930","offset":592},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":673},{"uri":"Johannes_Passion","surface_form":"St John Passion","offset":701},{"uri":"1724","surface_form":"1724","offset":719},{"uri":"Matth%C3%A4uspassion","surface_form":"St Matthew Passion","offset":734},{"uri":"1727","surface_form":"1727","offset":755},{"uri":"St_Luke_Passion_(Bach)","surface_form":"St Luke Passion","offset":789},{"uri":"1730","surface_form":"1730","offset":806},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":925},{"uri":"Arvo_P%C3%A4rt","surface_form":"Arvo P\u00E4rt","offset":934},{"uri":"Passio_Domini_Nostri_Jesu_Christi_secundum_Joannem","surface_form":"Passio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi secundum Joannem","offset":947},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":1061}]}
