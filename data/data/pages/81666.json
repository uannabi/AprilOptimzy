{"id":81666,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalia_group","text":"The Himalia group is a group of prograde non-spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Himalia and are thought to have a common origin.\nThe orbit estimate of the recently found moon 2000 J 11 also qualified it as a member of the group (it appeared to have the same inclination, and a slightly bigger semi-major axis)\nbut its orbit is not known exactly and the mean orbital elements have not yet been calculated.\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names in -a for the moons in this group.\nCharacteristics and origin.\nThe objects in the Himalia group have semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) in the range of 11,150,000 and 11,750,000\u00A0km, inclinations between 26.6\u00B0 and 28.3\u00B0, and eccentricities of between 0.11 and 0.25.\nAll moons in the group are grey similar to C-type asteroids. It has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the main asteroid belt. The radius of the parent asteroid was probably about 89\u00A0km, only a bit bigger than that of Himalia, which retains approximately 87% of the mass of the original body. This indicates the asteroid was not heavily disturbed.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prograde","surface_form":"prograde","offset":32},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":45},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":64},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":92},{"uri":"2000_J_11","surface_form":"2000 J 11","offset":197},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":280},{"uri":"Semi-major_axis","surface_form":"semi-major axis","offset":315},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":431},{"uri":"Semi-major_axis","surface_form":"semi-major axes","offset":586},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":673},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricities","offset":715},{"uri":"C-type_asteroid","surface_form":"C-type asteroid","offset":799},{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"main asteroid belt","offset":913}]}
