{"id":81686,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananke_group","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Ananke group is a group of moons of Jupiter. They are retrograde non-spherical moons that follow similar orbits to Ananke and may have a common origin.\nTheir semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000\u00A0km, their inclinations between 145.7\u00B0 and 154.8\u00B0, and their orbital eccentricities between 0.02 and 0.28.\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons, including this group's members.\nOrigin.\nThe Ananke group is believed to have been formed when an asteroid was captured by Jupiter and broken apart by a collision.\nBased on the sizes of the moons, the original asteroid may have been about 28\u00A0km in diameter. Since this value is near the approximate diameter of Ananke itself, it is likely the parent body was not heavily disrupted.\nThree of the moons of the family (Harpalyke, Praxidike and Iocaste) display similar grey colours while Ananke itself is on the boundary between grey and light red.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":53},{"uri":"Retrograde","surface_form":"retrograde","offset":71},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":86},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":122},{"uri":"Ananke_(moon)","surface_form":"Ananke","offset":132},{"uri":"Semi-major_axis","surface_form":"semi-major axes","offset":175},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":266},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"orbital eccentricities","offset":316},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":366},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":556},{"uri":"Harpalyke_(moon)","surface_form":"Harpalyke","offset":874},{"uri":"Praxidike_(moon)","surface_form":"Praxidike","offset":885},{"uri":"Iocaste_(moon)","surface_form":"Iocaste","offset":899}]}
