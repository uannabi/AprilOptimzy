{"id":81688,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carme_group","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Carme group is a group of retrograde non-spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Carme and are thought to have a common origin.\nTheir semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 22,900,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km, their inclinations between 164.9\u00B0 and 165.5\u00B0, and their orbital eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.27 (with one exception).\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names in -e for all retrograde moons, including this group's members.\nOrigin.\nThe Carme group may once have been a single body that was broken apart by an impact. Further support to the single body origin comes from the known colours: all the moons appear light red,\nand infrared spectra, similar to D-type asteroids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Retrograde_and_direct_motion","surface_form":"retrograde","offset":43},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":58},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":77},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":105},{"uri":"Semi-major_axis","surface_form":"semi-major axes","offset":168},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":259},{"uri":"Eccentricity","surface_form":"orbital eccentricities","offset":309},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":380},{"uri":"Infrared","surface_form":"infrared","offset":699},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_spectrum","surface_form":"spectra","offset":708},{"uri":"D-type_asteroid","surface_form":"D-type asteroid","offset":728}]}
