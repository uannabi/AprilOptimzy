{"id":81695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasipha%C3%AB_group","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Pasipha\u00EB group is a group of retrograde non-spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Pasipha\u00EB and are thought of have a common origin.\nTheir semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000\u00A0km (the same range as the Carme group), their inclinations between 144.5\u00B0 and 158.3\u00B0, and their eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43.\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons, including this group's members.\nOrigin.\nThe Pasipha\u00EB group is believed to have been formed when Jupiter captured an asteroid which broke up after a collision. The original asteroid was not disturbed heavily: the original body is calculated to have been 60\u00A0km in diameter, about the same size as Pasipha\u00EB; Pasipha\u00EB has 99% of the original body's mass. However, if Sinope belongs to the group, the amount is much smaller, 87%.\nThe differences of colour between the objects (grey for Pasipha\u00EB, light red for Callirrhoe and Megaclite) also suggest that the group could have a more complex origin than a single collision.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Retrograde","surface_form":"retrograde","offset":46},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":61},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":80},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":108},{"uri":"Pasipha%C3%AB_(moon)","surface_form":"Pasipha\u00EB","offset":118},{"uri":"Semi-major_axis","surface_form":"semi-major axes","offset":174},{"uri":"Carme_group","surface_form":"Carme group","offset":281},{"uri":"Inclination","surface_form":"inclination","offset":301},{"uri":"Orbital_eccentricity","surface_form":"eccentricities","offset":351},{"uri":"International_Astronomical_Union","surface_form":"International Astronomical Union","offset":393},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":602},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":748},{"uri":"Sinope_(moon)","surface_form":"Sinope","offset":849},{"uri":"Callirrhoe_(moon)","surface_form":"Callirrhoe","offset":991},{"uri":"Megaclite_(moon)","surface_form":"Megaclite","offset":1006}]}
