{"id":81717,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnosaur","text":"Carnosaurs are a subgroup of the theropod dinosaurs. They are the clade Carnosauria. The term was once used very widely, but is now defined more narrowly. It is called by some authorities the Allosauroidea.\nThe group includes some of the main carnivores of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, such as \"Allosaurus\", \"Carcharodontosaurus\" and \"Neovenator\". Modern cladistic analysis defines Carnosauria (or Allosauroidea) as those tetanurans which share a more recent common ancestor with \"Allosaurus\" than with modern birds.\nCarnosaurs are characterized by several features. Some features must have been adaptations to their large size, such as their open skull, made of struts rather than solid bone. They had\nlarge eyes and a long, narrow skull. The femur (\"thigh bone\") is usually larger than the tibia (\"shin bone\"). This suggests close-to action was controlled by sight.\nThe legs are adapted for running, but not extremely so. They had strong arms, probably used to wrestle prey as the teeth bit in. The structure of an \"Allosaurus\" suggests a strongly-built general all-round predator. This is a different from a tyrannosaur like \"Albertosaurus\", which was better adapted for running on open ground. Tyrannosaurs, with their small two-fingered hands, would use their heads for killing prey, and for head-butting rivals.\nThe idea that the group became extinct at the end of the Jurassic is refuted. It is now known that the Neovenatorid clade survived until the end of the Mesozoic. This group (see cladogram below) included \"Aerosteon\", \"Australovenator\", \"Fukuiraptor\" and \"Neovenator\".\nCladogram.\nThe cladogram presented here follows the 2010 analysis by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Theropod","surface_form":"theropod","offset":33},{"uri":"Dinosaurs","surface_form":"dinosaurs","offset":42},{"uri":"Clade","surface_form":"clade","offset":66},{"uri":"Carnosaurus","surface_form":"Carnosauria","offset":72},{"uri":"Carnivores","surface_form":"carnivores","offset":243},{"uri":"Jurassic","surface_form":"Jurassic","offset":261},{"uri":"Cretaceous","surface_form":"Cretaceous","offset":274},{"uri":"Period_(geology)","surface_form":"periods","offset":285},{"uri":"Allosaurus","surface_form":"Allosaurus","offset":303},{"uri":"Carcharodontosaurus","surface_form":"Carcharodontosaurus","offset":317},{"uri":"Neovenator","surface_form":"Neovenator","offset":343},{"uri":"Cladistics","surface_form":"cladistic analysis","offset":363},{"uri":"Tetanuran","surface_form":"tetanuran","offset":430},{"uri":"Common_ancestor","surface_form":"common ancestor","offset":467},{"uri":"Adaptations","surface_form":"adaptations","offset":604},{"uri":"Skull","surface_form":"skull","offset":656},{"uri":"Femur","surface_form":"femur","offset":752},{"uri":"Tibia","surface_form":"tibia","offset":800},{"uri":"Sight","surface_form":"sight","offset":869},{"uri":"Tyrannosaur","surface_form":"tyrannosaur","offset":1119},{"uri":"Albertosaurus","surface_form":"Albertosaurus","offset":1137},{"uri":"Mesozoic","surface_form":"Mesozoic","offset":1478},{"uri":"Aerosteon","surface_form":"Aerosteon","offset":1531},{"uri":"Australovenator","surface_form":"Australovenator","offset":1544},{"uri":"Fukuiraptor","surface_form":"Fukuiraptor","offset":1563},{"uri":"Neovenator","surface_form":"Neovenator","offset":1581},{"uri":"Cladogram","surface_form":"cladogram","offset":1609}]}
