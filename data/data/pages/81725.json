{"id":81725,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cressida_(moon)","text":"Cressida is a closer moon to Uranus. It was found from the images taken by \"Voyager 2\" on 1986-01-09, and was given the designation S/1986\u00A0U\u00A03. It was named after the Trojan daughter of Calchas, a tragic heroine who appears in William Shakespeare's play \"Troilus and Cressida\" (as well as in tales by Geoffrey Chaucer and others). It is also designated Uranus\u00A0IX.\nCressida belongs to Portia Group of moons, which also includes Bianca, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, radius of 41\u00A0km and geometric albedo of 0.08 almost nothing is known about it.\nAt the Voyager 2 images Cressida appears as a stretched object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axises of the Cressida's prolate spheroid is 0.8 \u00B1 0.3. Its surface is grey in color.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":29},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":76},{"uri":"1986-01-09","surface_form":"1986-01-09","offset":90},{"uri":"Troy","surface_form":"Trojan","offset":167},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":227},{"uri":"Troilus_and_Cressida","surface_form":"Troilus and Cressida","offset":255},{"uri":"Geoffrey_Chaucer","surface_form":"Geoffrey Chaucer","offset":301},{"uri":"Bianca_(moon)","surface_form":"Bianca","offset":427},{"uri":"Desdemona_(moon)","surface_form":"Desdemona","offset":435},{"uri":"Juliet_(moon)","surface_form":"Juliet","offset":446},{"uri":"Portia_(moon)","surface_form":"Portia","offset":454},{"uri":"Rosalind_(moon)","surface_form":"Rosalind","offset":462},{"uri":"Cupid_(moon)","surface_form":"Cupid","offset":472},{"uri":"Belinda_(moon)","surface_form":"Belinda","offset":479},{"uri":"Perdita_(moon)","surface_form":"Perdita","offset":491},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":668},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":757}]}
