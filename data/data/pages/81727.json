It is also designated Uranus\u00A0X.\nDesdemona belongs to Portia Group of moons, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 34\u00A0km and geometric albedo of 0.08 almost nothing is known about it.\nAt the Voyager 2 images Desdemona appears as a stretched object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axises of the Desdemona's prolate spheroid is 0.6 \u00B1 0.3. Its surface is grey in color.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":30},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":77},{"uri":"1986-01-13","surface_form":"1986-01-13","offset":91},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":193},{"uri":"Othello","surface_form":"Othello","offset":221},{"uri":"Bianca_(moon)","surface_form":"Bianca","offset":327},{"uri":"Cressida_(moon)","surface_form":"Cressida","offset":335},{"uri":"Juliet_(moon)","surface_form":"Juliet","offset":345},{"uri":"Portia_(moon)","surface_form":"Portia","offset":353},{"uri":"Rosalind_(moon)","surface_form":"Rosalind","offset":361},{"uri":"Cupid_(moon)","surface_form":"Cupid","offset":371},{"uri":"Belinda_(moon)","surface_form":"Belinda","offset":378},{"uri":"Perdita_(moon)","surface_form":"Perdita","offset":390},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":582},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":672}]}
