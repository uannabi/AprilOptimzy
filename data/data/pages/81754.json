{"id":81754,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliet_(moon)","text":"Juliet is a closer moon to Uranus. It was found from the images taken by \"Voyager 2\" on 1986-01-03, and was given the designation S/1986\u00A0U\u00A02. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\". It is also designated Uranus\u00A0XI.\nJuliet belongs to Portia Group of moons, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 53\u00A0km and geometric albedo of 0.08 almost nothing is known about it.\nAt the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as a stretched object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axises of the Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 \u00B1 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":27},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":74},{"uri":"1986-01-03","surface_form":"1986-01-03","offset":88},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":175},{"uri":"Romeo_and_Juliet","surface_form":"Romeo and Juliet","offset":203},{"uri":"Bianca_(moon)","surface_form":"Bianca","offset":316},{"uri":"Cressida_(moon)","surface_form":"Cressida","offset":324},{"uri":"Desdemona_(moon)","surface_form":"Desdemona","offset":334},{"uri":"Portia_(moon)","surface_form":"Portia","offset":345},{"uri":"Rosalind_(moon)","surface_form":"Rosalind","offset":353},{"uri":"Cupid_(moon)","surface_form":"Cupid","offset":363},{"uri":"Belinda_(moon)","surface_form":"Belinda","offset":370},{"uri":"Perdita_(moon)","surface_form":"Perdita","offset":382},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":574},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":661}]}
