{"id":81834,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portia_(moon)","text":"Portia is a closer moon to Uranus. It was found from the images taken by \"Voyager 2\" on 1986-01-03, and was given the designation S/1986\u00A0U\u00A01. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's play \"The Merchant of Venice\". It is also designated Uranus\u00A0XII.\nPortia is the second biggest closer moon of Uranus after Puck. The Portian orbit, which lies inside Uranus' synchronous orbital radius, is slowly shrinking due to tidal deceleration. The moon will one day either break up into a planetary ring or hit Uranus.\nIt heads a group of moons called Portia Group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties.\nLittle is known about Portia beyond its size of about 140\u00A0km, orbit, and geometric albedo of about 0.08.\nIn the Voyager 2 images, Portia appears as a stretched object whose major axis points towards Uranus. The ratio of axises of the Portia's prolate spheroid is 0.8 \u00B1 0.1. Its surface is grey in color. Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Portia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":27},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":74},{"uri":"1986-01-03","surface_form":"1986-01-03","offset":88},{"uri":"Portia_(Merchant_of_Venice)","surface_form":"Portia","offset":166},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":189},{"uri":"The_Merchant_of_Venice","surface_form":"The Merchant of Venice","offset":217},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":320},{"uri":"Puck_(moon)","surface_form":"Puck","offset":333},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":396},{"uri":"Tidal_deceleration","surface_form":"tidal deceleration","offset":439},{"uri":"Planetary_ring","surface_form":"planetary ring","offset":504},{"uri":"Bianca_(moon)","surface_form":"Bianca","offset":596},{"uri":"Cressida_(moon)","surface_form":"Cressida","offset":604},{"uri":"Desdemona_(moon)","surface_form":"Desdemona","offset":614},{"uri":"Juliet_(moon)","surface_form":"Juliet","offset":625},{"uri":"Rosalind_(moon)","surface_form":"Rosalind","offset":633},{"uri":"Cupid_(moon)","surface_form":"Cupid","offset":643},{"uri":"Belinda_(moon)","surface_form":"Belinda","offset":650},{"uri":"Perdita_(moon)","surface_form":"Perdita","offset":662},{"uri":"Albedo","surface_form":"albedo","offset":814},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":843},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":930},{"uri":"Prolate_spheroid","surface_form":"prolate spheroid","offset":974},{"uri":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"Hubble Space Telescope","offset":1053}]}
