These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 36\u00A0km and geometric albedo of 0.08 almost nothing is known about it.\nAt the Voyager 2 images Rosalind appears as an almost spherical object. The ratio of axises of the Rosalind's prolate spheroid is 1.0-0.8.
