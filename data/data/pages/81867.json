{"id":81867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid_(moon)","text":"Cupid is an inner moon (which makes it one of the closer moons) of Uranus. It was found by Mark Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope. It was named after a character in William Shakespeare's play \"Timon of Athens\".\nIt is the smallest of the closer Uranian moons, estimated to be only about 18\u00A0km in diameter. This and the dark surface made it too dim to be detected by the \"Voyager 2\" cameras during its Uranus flyby in 1986.\nThe orbit of Cupid is only 863\u00A0km from the orbit of the bigger moon Belinda. Amazingly, compared to Mab and Perdita, the recently found Uranian moons, it does not seem to be perturbed.\nFollowing its discovery, Cupid was given the designation S/2003 U 2. It is also designated Uranus XXVII.\nIt should not be confused with the asteroid 763 Cupido.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":67},{"uri":"Mark_Showalter","surface_form":"Mark Showalter","offset":91},{"uri":"Jack_J._Lissauer","surface_form":"Jack J.
