One of the main influences on this genre is the band Fugazi.\nPost-hardcore uses elements of hardcore, along with emo, metal, alternative rock or whatever, to create a more experimental sound. It can be more melodic than normal hardcore, but sometimes is heavier.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Musical_genre","surface_form":"musical genre","offset":19},{"uri":"Hardcore_punk","surface_form":"hardcore punk","offset":51},{"uri":"Punk_rock","surface_form":"punk rock","offset":95},{"uri":"Fugazi","surface_form":"Fugazi","offset":168},{"uri":"Emo","surface_form":"emo","offset":228},{"uri":"Heavy_metal_music","surface_form":"metal","offset":233},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative rock","offset":240}]}
