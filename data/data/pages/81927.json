He did not do his work on time and often fought with his friends at Nickelodeon. So they fired him. He made other shows but none were as popular as \"Ren and Stimpy\".\nReruns of \"Ren and Stimpy\" currently air on the Nicktoons Network.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_Kricfalusi","surface_form":"John Kricfalusi","offset":60},{"uri":"Ren_H%C3%B6ek","surface_form":"Ren H\u00F6ek","offset":132},{"uri":"Dog","surface_form":"dog","offset":144},{"uri":"Stimpy","surface_form":"Stimpson J.
