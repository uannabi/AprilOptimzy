{"id":81948,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Hesse","text":"The Grand Duchy of Hesse () was a former state that existed in modern-day Germany. It was formed in 1806 after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire as a result of the actions of Napoleon, who then elevated the former Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt to the level of grand duchy. For this reason, this state was occasionally known simply as Hesse-Darmstadt.\nHistory.\nBecause Hesse-Darmstadt was a member of Napoleon's Confederation of the Rhine, it was forced to give up a considerable amount of territory at the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The territory of the Duchy of Westphalia, which Hesse-Darmstadt received from the 1803 \"Reichsdeputationshauptschluss\", was given to the Kingdom of Prussia. However, it received some territory on the western bank of the Rhine, including the important federal fortress at Mainz.\nThe Grand Duchy changed its name to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine () in 1816.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":74},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":134},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":182},{"uri":"Landgraviate_of_Hesse-Darmstadt","surface_form":"Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt","offset":221},{"uri":"Grand_duchy","surface_form":"grand duchy","offset":269},{"uri":"Confederation_of_the_Rhine","surface_form":"Confederation of the Rhine","offset":420},{"uri":"Congress_of_Vienna","surface_form":"Congress of Vienna","offset":520},{"uri":"Duchy_of_Westphalia","surface_form":"Duchy of Westphalia","offset":561},{"uri":"Reichsdeputationshauptschluss","surface_form":"Reichsdeputationshauptschluss","offset":628},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Prussia","offset":677},{"uri":"Rhine","surface_form":"Rhine","offset":760},{"uri":"Mainz","surface_form":"Mainz","offset":811}]}
