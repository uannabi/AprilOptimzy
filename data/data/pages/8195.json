{"id":8195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series","text":"e=\"preserve\">A series is a group of similar things that are all related to the same topic.\nIn mathematics, a series is the adding of a list of (usually never-ending) mathematical objects (such as numbers). It is sometimes written as formula_1, which is another way of writing formula_1.\nHere, the dots mean that the adding does not have a last term, but goes on to infinity.\nFrom these, we can see that this series will have 2 as its sum.\nHowever, not all series have a sum. For example. a series can go to positive or negative infinity, or just go up and down without settling on any particular value. In which case, the series is said to diverge. The harmonic series is an example of a series which diverges.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":94},{"uri":"Infinity","surface_form":"infinity","offset":528},{"uri":"Harmonic_series_(mathematics)","surface_form":"harmonic series","offset":653}]}
