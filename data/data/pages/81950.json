{"id":81950,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck_(moon)","text":"Puck is a closer moon to Uranus. Puck was found from the images taken by \"Voyager 2\" on December 30, 1985, and was given the designation S/1985\u00A0U\u00A01.\nIn Celtic mythology and English folklore, a \"Puck\" is a mischievous sprite, imagined as an evil demon by Christians; the moon is named after the Puck who appears in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", in which he travels around the globe at night with the fairies. It is also designated Uranus\u00A0XV.\nPuck is the biggest of the small closer moons to Uranus. It is in the middle in size between Portia and Miranda, the smallest of the five bigger moons. Puck's orbit is also located between these two moons. Little is known about it aside from its orbit, its radius about 81\u00A0km, and its geometric albedo approximately 0.11.\nOf the moons found by the \"Voyager\u00A02\" imaging team, only Puck was found early enough that the probe could be programmed to take pictures of it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axises is 0.97 \u00B1 0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters on the surface of Puck. Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":25},{"uri":"Voyager_2","surface_form":"Voyager 2","offset":74},{"uri":"1985","surface_form":"1985","offset":101},{"uri":"Puck_(mythology)","surface_form":"Puck","offset":194},{"uri":"A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream","surface_form":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","offset":329},{"uri":"Fairy","surface_form":"fairies","offset":412},{"uri":"Portia_(moon)","surface_form":"Portia","offset":547},{"uri":"Miranda_(moon)","surface_form":"Miranda","offset":558},{"uri":"Albedo","surface_form":"albedo","offset":749},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spheroid","offset":993},{"uri":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"Hubble Space Telescope","offset":1167}]}
