During the Convention, members stressed their concern of the Ittihad (Young Turk) government's blatant disregard of the Armenian lives who resided in Historic Armenia. The Hunchaks feared that this disregard would only escalate as time past. The Hunchaks also stressed the importance of a United Independent Armenia which would be impossible under the racist and dictatorial Young Turk government's rule of the Ottoman Empire.\nI - As stated in its original program, the party was to move from licit to illicit activities, thus becoming once again a covert organization.\nII - To plan and assassinate the leaders of the Ittihad (Young Turk) party, the same leaders that carried out the Adana massacres of 1909, and thus the same leaders who at that moment were planning the annihilation of the Armenian people.\nUnfortunately, these secret objectives were passed on to the Turks by an Armenian agent for the government; consequently as soon as the delegates arrived in Constantinople, they were arrested. By the end of the year a total of one hundred and forty Hunchak leaders were arrested.\nAfter spending two years in terrible conditions in Turkish prisons, and undergoing lengthy mock trials, twenty prominent figures - Paramaz, Dr. Benne, Aram Ach'ekbashian, Vanig and others were sentenced to death by hanging. A few weeks after the beginning of the Armenian Genocide on June 15, 1915, all twenty men were hanged in the central square of Constantinople, known as Sultan Bayazid Square. Paramaz's last words before his hanging were, \"You can only hang our bodies, but not our ideology....You will see tomorrow on the Eastern horizon a Socialist Armenia.\"\nSince their execution, the Twenty Martyrs have been a source of inspiration for thousands of young Armenians throughout the world.\nIn 2001 the monument of Paramaz and his 19 Hunchakian comrades was opened in Meghri town, Armenia.\nThe list of hanged Hunchakians.\nTwo other prominent Hunchakian activists, Stepan Sabah-Goulian and Varaztahd, were condemned to death \"in absentia\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Social_Democrat_Hunchakian_Party","surface_form":"Hunchakian","offset":118},{"uri":"Constantinople","surface_form":"Constantinople","offset":187},{"uri":"June_15","surface_form":"June 15","offset":205},{"uri":"1915","surface_form":"1915","offset":214},{"uri":"Social_Democrat_Hunchakian_Party","surface_form":"Social Democrat Hunchakian Party","offset":263},{"uri":"Constan%C5%A3a","surface_form":"Constan\u0163a","offset":314},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":325},{"uri":"1913","surface_form":"1913","offset":337},{"uri":"Armenian_people","surface_form":"Armenian people","offset":430},{"uri":"Ittihad","surface_form":"Ittihad","offset":519},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":869},{"uri":"Paramaz","surface_form":"Paramaz","offset":1678},{"uri":"Armenian_Genocide","surface_form":"Armenian Genocide","offset":1810},{"uri":"June_15","surface_form":"June 15","offset":1831},{"uri":"1915","surface_form":"1915","offset":1840},{"uri":"Constantinople","surface_form":"Constantinople","offset":1898},{"uri":"2001","surface_form":"2001","offset":2248},{"uri":"Meghri","surface_form":"Meghri","offset":2322},{"uri":"Armenia","surface_form":"Armenia","offset":2335}]}
