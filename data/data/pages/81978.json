{"id":81978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup","text":"The 1990 FIFA World Cup was a football (soccer) sporting event that was held in Italy from 8 June to 8 July 1990. 24 teams took part from many countries. Germany won the trophy after beating Argentina in the final.\nThe 1990 FIFA World Cup had the lowest amount of goals, and had 16 red cards handed out. However, the 1990 FIFA World Cup was one of the most watched sporting events of all time. This was also the last World Cup that had 2 points for a win in the Group Stage.\nQualification.\n24 teams qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Costa Rica, Republic of Ireland and the United Arab Emirates qualified for the first time.\nGroup A.\nHosts Italy won Group A with a 100 percent record. They beat Austria 1\u20130 thanks to substitute Salvatore 'Tot\u00F2' Schillaci, who had played only one international before but would become a star during the tournament. A second 1\u20130 victory followed against a United States team already thumped 5\u20131 by Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovaks ended runners-up in the group, while the USA's first appearance in a World Cup Finals since 1950 ended with three consecutive defeats.\nGroup B.\nCameroon defeated reigning champions Argentina. Despite ending the match with only nine men, the African team held on for a shock 1\u20130 win, with contrasting fortunes for the brothers Biyik: Fran\u00E7ois Omam scoring the winning goal, shortly after seeing Andre Kana sent off for a serious foul. In their second game the introduction of Roger Milla was the catalyst for a 2\u20131 win over Romania, Milla scoring twice from the bench (making him the oldest goalscorer in the tournament). With progression assured, Cameroon slumped to a 4\u20130 defeat in their final group game to a Soviet Union (in what would be their last World Cup due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union) side striving to stay in the tournament on goal difference after successive 2\u20130 defeats. A 1\u20131 draw between Romania and Argentina sent both through, the latter as one of the best third-placed teams.\nGroup C.\nCosta Rica beat Scotland 1\u20130 in their first match, lost 1\u20130 to Brazil in their second, then saw off Sweden 2\u20131 to claim a place in the second round. Brazil took maximum points from the group. They began with a 2\u20131 win over Sweden, then beat both Costa Rica and Scotland 1\u20130. Scotland's 2\u20131 win over Sweden was not enough to save them from an early return home as one of the two lowest-ranked third-placed teams.\nGroup D.\nGroup D featured the most goals of all the groups, due in part to the defensive inadequacies of a United Arab Emirates team that lost 2\u20130 to Colombia, 5\u20131 to West Germany and 4\u20131 to Yugoslavia. West Germany topped the group after a 4\u20131 opening victory over group runners-up Yugoslavia.\nGroup E.\nThe winners of Group E were Spain, for whom Michel hit a hat-trick as they beat South Korea 3\u20131 in an unbeaten group campaign. Belgium won their first two games against South Korea and Uruguay to ensure their progress; Uruguay's advance to the second round came with an injury time winner against South Korea to edge them through as the weakest of the third-placed sides to remain in the tournament.\nGroup F.\nGroup F, featured the Netherlands, England, the Republic of Ireland and Egypt. In the six group games, no team managed to score more than once in a match. England beat Egypt 1\u20130, thanks to a 64th-minute goal from Mark Wright \u2013 and that was enough to win the group.\nThe Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands finished with identical records. With both teams assured of progressing, they were split by the drawing of lots to determine second and third place.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage involved the 16 teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, final. There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by 30 minutes of extra time; if scores were still level there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round. Scores after extra time are indicated by (aet), and penalty shoot outs are indicated by (p).\nRound of 16.\nTwo of the ties \u2013 Argentina vs Brazil and Italy vs Uruguay \u2013 pitted former champion countries against each other, and West Germany met the Netherlands in a rematch of the 1974 World Cup Final.\nThe all-South American game was won for Argentina by a goal from Claudio Caniggia with 10 minutes remaining after a run through the Brazilian defence by Diego Maradona and an outstanding performance from their goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea. It would later come to light that Branco had been offered water spiked with tranquilisers by Maradona and Ricardo Giusti during half time, to slow him down in the second half. Initially discredited by the press, Branco would be publicly proven right years later, when Maradona confessed the episode in a TV show in Argentina. As for Italy, a strong second half showing saw the hosts beat Uruguay 2\u20130, thanks to another goal from Schillaci and one from Aldo Serena.\nThe match between West Germany and the Netherlands was held in Milan, and both sides featured several notable players from the two Milanese clubs (Germans Andreas Brehme, Lothar Matth\u00E4us and J\u00FCrgen Klinsmann for Internazionale, and Dutchmen Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard for Milan). After 22 minutes Rudi V\u00F6ller and Rijkaard were both dismissed after a number of incidents (including Rijkaard spitting on V\u00F6ller) between the two players left the Argentine referee with no option but to send them both off. As the players walked off the pitch together, Rijkaard spat on V\u00F6ller a second time. Early in the second half, J\u00FCrgen Klinsmann put the West Germans ahead and Andreas Brehme added a second with eight minutes left. A Ronald Koeman penalty for the Netherlands in the 89th minute narrowed the score to 2\u20131 but the Germans saw the game out to gain some revenge for their exit to the Dutch in the previous European Championship.\nMeanwhile, the heroics of Cameroon and Roger Milla continued in their game with Colombia. Milla was introduced as a second-half substitute with the game goalless, eventually breaking the deadlock midway in extra time. Three minutes later he netted a second after Colombian goalkeeper, Ren\u00E9 Higuita was dispossessed by Milla while well out of his goal, leaving the striker free to slot the ball into the empty net. Though the deficit was soon reduced to 2\u20131, Cameroon held on to become the first African team ever to reach the World Cup quarter-finals. Costa Rica were comfortably beaten 4\u20131 by Czechoslovakia, for whom Tom\u00E1\u0161 Skuhrav\u00FD scored the tournament's second and final hat-trick.\nThe Republic of Ireland's match with Romania remained goalless after extra time, and the Irish side won 5\u20134 on penalties. David O'Leary converted the penalty that clinched Ireland's place in the quarter-finals. Ireland thus became the first team since Sweden in 1938 to reach the last eight in a World Cup finals tournament without winning a match outright. Yugoslavia beat Spain 2\u20131 after extra time, with Dragan Stojkovi\u0107 scoring both the Yugoslavs' goals. England were the final qualifier against Belgium, as midfielder David Platt's swivelling volley broke the stalemate with the game moments away from a penalty shoot-out.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first game of the last 8 saw Argentina and a Yugoslav side, reduced to 10 men after only half an hour, play out a goalless stalemate. The holders reached the semi-finals after winning the penalty shoot-out 3\u20132, despite Maradona having his penalty saved. A second Argentine miss (by Pedro Troglio) looked to have eliminated them until goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea \u2013 playing because first choice Nery Pumpido broke his leg during the group stage \u2013 rescued his side by stopping the Yugoslavs' final two spotkicks.\nThe Republic of Ireland's World Cup run was brought to an end by a single goal from Schillaci in the first half of their quarter-final with hosts Italy. West Germany beat Czechoslovakia with a 25th minute Lothar Matth\u00E4us penalty.\nThe most intriguing match of the quarter-finals was between England and Cameroon. Apart from anything else, it was the only quarter-final to produce more than one goal. Despite Cameroon's heroics earlier in the tournament, David Platt put England ahead in the 25th minute. At half-time, Milla was brought on. In the second half, the game was turned on its head during a five-minute stretch: first Cameroon were awarded a penalty from which Emmanuel Kunde scored the equaliser; then in the 65th minute Eugene Ekeke put Cameroon ahead. Cameroon came within eight minutes of reaching the semi-finals before then they conceded a penalty, which Gary Lineker converted. Midway through extra time, England were awarded another penalty, and Lineker again scored from the spot. England were through to the semi-finals for the first time in 24 years.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first semi-final featured the host nation, Italy, and the world champion, Argentina in Naples. 'Toto' Schillaci scored yet again to put Italy ahead in the 17th minute, but Claudio Cannigia equalised midway through the second half, breaking Walter Zenga's clean sheet streak throughout the tournament. There were no more goals in the 90 minutes or in extra time despite Maradona (who played for Naples in Serie A at the time) in showing glimpses of magic, but there was a sending-off: Ricardo Giusti of Argentina was shown the red card in the 13th minute of extra time. Argentina went through on penalties, winning the shoot-out 4\u20133 after more heroics from Goycochea.\nThe semi-final between West Germany and England at Juventus's home stadium in Turin was goalless at half-time. Then, in the 60th minute, a shot from Andreas Brehme was deflected by Paul Parker into his own net. England equalised with 10 minutes left, Gary Lineker was the scorer. The game ended 1-1. Extra time yielded more chances and Klinsmann was guilty of two glaring misses while both sides struck a post. England had another Platt goal disallowed for offside. The match went to penalties and West Germany went on to win the 4-3.\nThird-place match.\nThe game saw three goals in a 15-minute spell. Roberto Baggio opened the scoring after a rare mistake by England's goalkeeper Peter Shilton, in his final game before international retirement, presented a simple opportunity. A header by David Platt levelled the game 10 minutes later but Schillaci was fouled in the penalty area five minutes later, leading to a penalty. Schillaci himself got up to convert the kick to win him the tournament's Golden Boot for his six-goal tally. Nicola Berti had a goal ruled out minutes later, but the hosts claimed third place. England had the consolation prize of the Fair Play award, having received no red cards and the lowest average number of yellows per match.\nFinal.\nThe final between West Germany and Argentina has been cited as the most cynical and lowest quality of all World Cup Finals. In the 65th minute, Argentina's Pedro Monzon was sent off for a foul on J\u00FCrgen Klinsmann, the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup Final.\nArgentina, weakened by suspension and injury, offered little attacking threat throughout a contest dominated by the West Germans, who struggled to create many clear goalscoring opportunities. The only goal of the contest arrived in the 85th minute when Mexican referee Edgardo Codesal awarded a penalty to West Germany, after a foul on Rudi V\u00F6ller by Roberto Sensini. Andreas Brehme, who later said there was no foul, converted the spot kick to settle the contest. In the closing moments, Argentina were reduced to nine after Gustavo Dezotti received the second yellow card of the game when he hauled J\u00FCrgen Kohler to the ground during a stoppage in play. The 1\u20130 scoreline provided another first: Argentina were the first team to fail to score in a World Cup Final.\nWith its third title (and three second-place finishes) West Germany \u2013 in its final tournament before national reunification \u2013 became the most successful World Cup nation at the time. West German manager Franz Beckenbauer became the only man to both captain (in 1974) and manage a World Cup winning team, and only the second man (after M\u00E1rio Zagallo of Brazil) to win the World Cup as a player and as team manager. It was also the first time a team from UEFA won the final against a non-European team.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"FIFA_World_Cup","surface_form":"FIFA World
