Gladman, Philip D. Nicholson, Joseph A. Burns, and John J. Kavelaars using the 200-inch Hale telescope together with Sycorax and given the designation S/1997\u00A0U\u00A01.\nDesignated Uranus\u00A0XVI it was named after the monster fictional character in William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\".\nThe orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Stephano to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.\nThe diameter is estimated at 72\u00A0km (assuming albedo of 0.04), making it the second biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus, half the size of Sycorax, the biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus.\nThe light curve suggests Caliban's rotation period is 2.7 hours.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prograde_and_retrograde_motion","surface_form":"retrograde","offset":30},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":45},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":63},{"uri":"Palomar_Observatory","surface_form":"Hale telescope","offset":203},{"uri":"Sycorax_(moon)","surface_form":"Sycorax","offset":232},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":331},{"uri":"William_Shakespeare","surface_form":"William Shakespeare","offset":354},{"uri":"The_Tempest","surface_form":"The Tempest","offset":382},{"uri":"Stephano_(moon)","surface_form":"Stephano","offset":461},{"uri":"Albedo","surface_form":"albedo","offset":570},{"uri":"Sycorax_(moon)","surface_form":"Sycorax","offset":663},{"uri":"Light_curve","surface_form":"light curve","offset":718}]}
