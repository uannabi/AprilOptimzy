{"id":82001,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycorax_(moon)","text":"Sycorax is one of Uranus' moons. It is the biggest retrograde non-spherical one of its moons.\nSycorax was found on September 6, 1997 by Brett J. Gladman, Philip D. Nicholson, Joseph A. Burns, and John J. Kavelaars. They found it using the 200-inch Hale telescope. They also found Caliban. Sycorax was given the designation S/1997\u00A0U\u00A02.\nSycorax was confirmed as Uranus\u00A0XVII. It was named after Sycorax, Caliban's mother in William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\".\nOrbit.\nSycorax follows a far orbit, more than 20 times farther from Uranus than the farthest regular moon Oberon. Its orbit is retrograde, moderately inclined and eccentric.\nThe orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Setebos and Prospero, to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.\nThe diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde non-spherical moons of Uranus (in polar co-ordinates) with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre.\nPhysical characteristics.\nThe diameter of Sycorax is estimated at 150\u00A0km (assuming albedo of 0.04) making it the biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus, comparable in size with Himalia, the biggest non-spherical moon of Jupiter.\nThe rotation period could not be estimated well (best fit ~4 h).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":18},{"uri":"Prograde_and_retrograde_motion","surface_form":"retrograde","offset":51},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":66},{"uri":"Brett_J._Gladman","surface_form":"Brett J.
