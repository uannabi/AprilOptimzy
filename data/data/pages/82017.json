{"id":82017,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaz%C3%A1n","text":"Almaz\u00E1n is a city in Castilla y Le\u00F3n, in Spain. The city name comes from Arabic. There it means \"The fortified place\". It is located about 32\u00A0km south of the capital of the province (Valladolid), and about 192\u00A0km from Madrid. Today, about 5.700 people live there.\nThe city has a long history. In it, the Pedro IV of Aragon and Enrique II of Castilla signed the truce between Castillla and Aragon. Juan Hurtado de Mendoza was the majordomo of king Enrique III. The king Enrique IV of Castilla gave the city to him. He also got to supervise the city. Later the duchy was divided into two different parts.\nThe city itself was governed by the \"Alcalde Mayor\". He was helped by a committee of people from the city (3 noblemen, and 3 from the Hidalgo class).\nThe city belonged to the county of Altamira. The counts descended from Hernando de Mendoza.\nDiego La\u00EDnez was a Jesuit monk who was born in the city. He was a companion to San Ignacio de Loyola. He also succeeded him as head of the Society of Jesus, a Catholic religious order. La\u00EDnez later had a large influence in the Council of Trent.\nMost of the city is built in a Romanesque style. There are also some examples of Baroque, Renaissance and Gothic art styles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":13},{"uri":"Castilla_y_Le%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Castilla y Le\u00F3n","offset":21},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":41},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":73},{"uri":"Valladolid","surface_form":"Valladolid","offset":183},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":218},{"uri":"Pedro_IV","surface_form":"Pedro IV","offset":304},{"uri":"Enrique_II","surface_form":"Enrique II","offset":327},{"uri":"Truce","surface_form":"truce","offset":361},{"uri":"Castillla","surface_form":"Castillla","offset":375},{"uri":"Aragon","surface_form":"Aragon","offset":389},{"uri":"Juan_Hurtado_de_Mendoza","surface_form":"Juan Hurtado de Mendoza","offset":397},{"uri":"Majordomo","surface_form":"majordomo","offset":429},{"uri":"Enrique_III","surface_form":"Enrique III","offset":447},{"uri":"Enrique_IV_of_Castilla","surface_form":"Enrique IV of Castilla","offset":469},{"uri":"Altamira","surface_form":"Altamira","offset":788},{"uri":"Diego_La%C3%ADnez","surface_form":"Diego La\u00EDnez","offset":845},{"uri":"Jesuit","surface_form":"Jesuit","offset":864},{"uri":"Monk","surface_form":"monk","offset":871},{"uri":"Ignacio_de_Loyola","surface_form":"Ignacio de Loyola","offset":928},{"uri":"Society_of_Jesus","surface_form":"Society of Jesus","offset":984},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholic","offset":1004},{"uri":"Council_of_Trent","surface_form":"Council of Trent","offset":1072},{"uri":"Romanesque_architecture","surface_form":"Romanesque","offset":1121},{"uri":"Baroque_architecture","surface_form":"Baroque","offset":1171},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":1180},{"uri":"Gothic_art","surface_form":"Gothic art","offset":1196}]}
