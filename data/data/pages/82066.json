{"id":82066,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building","text":"The Empire State Building is a skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City, United States. It is tall and has 102 floors. Named after the popular nickname for New York, the Empire State, it is one of the most famous landmarks in the US. When the Empire State Building opened on May 1, 1931, it was the world's tallest building.\nHistory.\nDesigned by the architects named Shreve, Lamb & Harmon Associates, it was built at a time when many people were trying to make the world's tallest building, but the Empire State Building won. The old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was destroyed so that the Empire State Building could be built. The Empire State Building was completed in 410 days. It opened on May 1, 1931, when United States President Herbert Hoover pushed a button in Washington, D.C. to turn on the lights. The Empire State Building's design was based on the 21-story Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, built in 1929. In the 1930s, the Empire State Building was called the \"Empty State Building\" because not many people worked in the building.\nThe Empire State Building became the tallest building in New York City and the world until the first World Trade Center towers passed it in 1970. When these towers were brought down in the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Empire State Building was again the tallest building in New York. It stopped being New York's tallest building in 2012 when the new One World Trade Center was built.\nOn Saturday, July 28, 1945, a plane crashed into the building due to heavy fog and started a fire, but the building was only damaged a little. 14 people (3 in the plane) were killed in the accident.\nBuilding design.\nThe Empire State Building is at 350 Fifth Avenue. The building has its own ZIP Code, 10118. There is a big Art Deco lobby with shops at Fifth Avenue. People can also go to a lobby on 34th Street. The Empire State Building has 73 elevators.\nThe 80th, 86th, and 102nd floors have places where people can look at the city from high above. There is a steel mast on the top of the Empire State Building. The builders wanted to have an airship station on the roof, but the station was not opened. Today, people cannot go to the mast. The mast has a radio transmitter. The Empire State Building also lights up at night.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Skyscraper","surface_form":"skyscraper","offset":31},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":45},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":56},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":71},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":154},{"uri":"Landmark","surface_form":"landmark","offset":211},{"uri":"Architects","surface_form":"architects","offset":348},{"uri":"List_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_world","surface_form":"world's tallest building","offset":463},{"uri":"Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel","surface_form":"Waldorf-Astoria Hotel","offset":532},{"uri":"Destroy","surface_form":"destroyed","offset":558},{"uri":"May_1","surface_form":"May 1","offset":684},{"uri":"1931","surface_form":"1931","offset":691},{"uri":"United_States_President","surface_form":"United States President","offset":702},{"uri":"Herbert_Hoover","surface_form":"Herbert Hoover","offset":726},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":760},{"uri":"Reynolds_Building","surface_form":"Reynolds Building","offset":861},{"uri":"Winston-Salem%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Winston-Salem","offset":882},{"uri":"World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)","surface_form":"World Trade Center","offset":1139},{"uri":"September_11%2C_2001_attacks","surface_form":"September 11, 2001 attacks","offset":1227},{"uri":"One_World_Trade_Center","surface_form":"One World Trade Center","offset":1391},{"uri":"B-25_Empire_State_Building_crash","surface_form":"Saturday, July 28, 1945","offset":1428},{"uri":"Fifth_Avenue","surface_form":"Fifth Avenue","offset":1677},{"uri":"ZIP_Code","surface_form":"ZIP Code","offset":1716},{"uri":"Art_Deco","surface_form":"Art Deco","offset":1748},{"uri":"Lobby","surface_form":"lobby","offset":1757},{"uri":"Shop","surface_form":"shop","offset":1768},{"uri":"Airship","surface_form":"airship","offset":2071},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio transmitter","offset":2184}]}
