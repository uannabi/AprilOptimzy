Kavelaars \"et al.\" and designated S/1999\u00A0U\u00A01.\nConfirmed as Uranus\u00A0XIX it is named after the god worshipped by Caliban and Sycorax in William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\".\nThe orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Sycorax and Prospero to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin. However, this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours. The moon appears grey in the visible light, similar to Prospero but different from Sycorax (which is \"light red\").","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Prograde_and_retrograde_motion","surface_form":"retrograde","offset":31},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":46},{"uri":"Uranus_(planet)","surface_form":"Uranus","offset":65},{"uri":"1999-07-18","surface_form":"1999-07-18","offset":89},{"uri":"John_J._Kavelaars","surface_form":"John J.
