{"id":82087,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Noel","text":"Hurricane Noel was the fourteenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Noel formed on October 27 from the interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the north-central Caribbean Sea. It strengthened to winds of 60\u00A0mph (95\u00A0km/h) before making landfall on western Haiti and the north coast of eastern Cuba. It turned northward, and on November 1 it attained hurricane status. The hurricane accelerated northeastward after crossing the Bahamas, and on November 2 it became an extratropical cyclone. (The Canadian Hurricane Centre classified Noel as a post-tropical storm until 2200 UTC November 4 when it determined that it had lost all tropical characteristics.)\nThe storm caused at least 169 deaths along its path, primarily in Hispaniola, due to flooding and mudslides. It was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane of the 2007 season. After its transition to post-tropical, Noel became a very strong low pressure system causing flooding and wind damage over Maine and Eastern Canada. It even dropped snow over some areas of Eastern Quebec and Labrador.\nRetirement.\nThe name Noel was retired in May 2008 and replaced by Nestor for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2007_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2007 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":73},{"uri":"October_27","surface_form":"October 27","offset":120},{"uri":"Tropical_wave","surface_form":"tropical wave","offset":162},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":220},{"uri":"Landfall_(meteorology)","surface_form":"landfall","offset":294},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":314},{"uri":"November_1","surface_form":"November 1","offset":385},{"uri":"Bahamas","surface_form":"Bahamas","offset":485},{"uri":"November_2","surface_form":"November 2","offset":501},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical cyclone","offset":525},{"uri":"Canadian_Hurricane_Centre","surface_form":"Canadian Hurricane Centre","offset":553},{"uri":"November_4","surface_form":"November 4","offset":635},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":779},{"uri":"Flood","surface_form":"flood","offset":798},{"uri":"Landslide","surface_form":"mudslide","offset":811},{"uri":"Atlantic_hurricane","surface_form":"Atlantic hurricane","offset":843},{"uri":"Low_pressure_area","surface_form":"low","offset":947},{"uri":"Maine","surface_form":"Maine","offset":1005},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1023},{"uri":"Quebec","surface_form":"Quebec","offset":1079},{"uri":"Labrador%2C_Canada","surface_form":"Labrador","offset":1090},{"uri":"2013_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2013 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":1181}]}
