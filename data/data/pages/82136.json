{"id":82136,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_and_George_Weasley","text":"e=\"preserve\">Fred and George Weasley are characters in J.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series. They are twins and brothers of Harry Potter's best friend Ron Weasley; younger than Bill, Charlie, and Percy, but older than Ginny and Ron. They're in the middle of the seven Weasley children. They have red hair and are proud to be Weasleys. In the movies, both twins are tall and skinny. In the books they are described as shorter and stockier than Ron.\nAlthough these two are not very big characters in the seven-book installment, they play some big roles in a few books. In \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", the twins show Harry the Marauder's Map that they found that leads to many useful and helpful things. In \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (their seventh year), the two escape Hogwarts and the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge and left a fantastic fireworks show and a giant \"W\". The students found it amusing and use the phrase \"rolling a Weasley\" to describe disappointment at something and wanted to go away. Fred and George are also involved in Harry's big study group that is called D.A. (Dumbledore's Army). In the beginning of \"Half-Blood Prince\", Ron, Hermione, and Harry, followed by Ginny, Mrs. and Mr. Weasley, visit the twins in their new joke shop. They are excited to see them and show all their new joke shop supplies. In \"Deathly Hallows\", Fred Weasley gets killed outside the room of requirement by an explosion presumably by Augustus Rookwood, breaking the hearts of many Harry Potter fans. George gets his ear accidentally cut off by Severus Snape using Sectumsempra. George marries Angelina Johnson.\nFred and George are usually described as determined, mischievous, and very sneaky. They get scolded by their mother, Molly Weasley for many things that they do (for example, Apparating right in front of her eyes in \"Order of the Phoenix\".)\nThe actors who portrayed Fred and George are James and Oliver Phelps respectively. Oliver is actually the older twin, but Fred is older than George. Two differences between the Phelps twins is that Oliver has a mole on the right side of his neck, while James does not and James has a slightly deeper voice than Oliver.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"characters","offset":41},{"uri":"J.K._Rowling","surface_form":"J.K.
