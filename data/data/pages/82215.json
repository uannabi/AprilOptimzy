{"id":82215,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposer","text":"A decomposer is an organism that breaks down long chain polymers from dead organisms into smaller molecules. Decomposers are bacteria and fungi. What they do is use the parts and energy to build up their own materials, which are also organic.\nDecomposers are heterotrophs. This means they use organic substrates to get their energy, carbon and nutrients for growth and development.\nDecomposers break down cells of other organisms using biochemical reactions without need for internal digestion. This is different from detritivores, which actually digest dead organic matter.\nDecomposition also involves abiotic decomposition. This is breakdown by chemical processes, such as hydrolysis, or physical processes, such as heat. This turns organic material into inorganic material, and so returns nutrients to the environment.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Organism","surface_form":"organism","offset":19},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":56},{"uri":"Molecules","surface_form":"molecules","offset":98},{"uri":"Bacteria","surface_form":"bacteria","offset":125},{"uri":"Fungi","surface_form":"fungi","offset":138},{"uri":"Organic","surface_form":"organic","offset":234},{"uri":"Heterotroph","surface_form":"heterotroph","offset":259},{"uri":"Organic","surface_form":"organic substrates","offset":293},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":325},{"uri":"Carbon","surface_form":"carbon","offset":333},{"uri":"Nutrients","surface_form":"nutrients","offset":344},{"uri":"Growth","surface_form":"growth","offset":358},{"uri":"Development","surface_form":"development","offset":369},{"uri":"Cells","surface_form":"cells","offset":405},{"uri":"Biochemical","surface_form":"biochemical","offset":436},{"uri":"Digestion","surface_form":"digestion","offset":484},{"uri":"Detritivore","surface_form":"detritivore","offset":518},{"uri":"Decomposition","surface_form":"Decomposition","offset":575},{"uri":"Abiotic","surface_form":"abiotic","offset":603},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":647},{"uri":"Hydrolysis","surface_form":"hydrolysis","offset":675},{"uri":"Inorganic","surface_form":"inorganic","offset":757},{"uri":"Nutrients","surface_form":"nutrients","offset":792},{"uri":"Environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":809}]}
