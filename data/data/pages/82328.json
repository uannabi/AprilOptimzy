{"id":82328,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland","text":"e=\"preserve\">Wayland was the Germanic god of blacksmiths. In Anglo-Saxon writing, he appears in \"Deor\", \"Waldere\" and in \"Beowulf\" and the legend is shown on the Franks Casket. [http://homeros.godsong.org/FRANKS_CASKET.pdf]\nWayland is connected with Wayland's Smithy, a burial mound in Oxfordshire. This was named by the Saxons, but it was there before them. The place has a superstition that says that if a horse is left there overnight with a small silver coin (\"groat\"), it would have new shoes by morning.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germanic_paganism","surface_form":"Germanic","offset":29},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"god","offset":38},{"uri":"Blacksmith","surface_form":"blacksmith","offset":45},{"uri":"Anglo-Saxon","surface_form":"Anglo-Saxon","offset":61},{"uri":"Deor","surface_form":"Deor","offset":97},{"uri":"Waldere","surface_form":"Waldere","offset":105},{"uri":"Beowulf","surface_form":"Beowulf","offset":122},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":139},{"uri":"Franks_Casket","surface_form":"Franks Casket","offset":162},{"uri":"Wayland%27s_Smithy","surface_form":"Wayland's Smithy","offset":250},{"uri":"Burial_mound","surface_form":"burial mound","offset":270},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":286},{"uri":"Saxon","surface_form":"Saxon","offset":321},{"uri":"Superstition","surface_form":"superstition","offset":375},{"uri":"Horse","surface_form":"horse","offset":408},{"uri":"Silver","surface_form":"silver","offset":451},{"uri":"Coin","surface_form":"coin","offset":458},{"uri":"Horseshoe","surface_form":"shoes","offset":492}]}
