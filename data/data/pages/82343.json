{"id":82343,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance","text":"Repentance means that a person wants to get rid of the sin that it has committed. In some cases, individuals or nations repent of their sins and are spared God's judgment. Sometimes the punishment avoided is destruction in this life, sometimes it is damnation.\nIf repentance is successful one speaks of salvation.\nTo you repent you must- Admit to God that you are a sinner. Believe that God sent his one and only son to die for all of our sins. Commit yourself to a life of following Jesus and serving others.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":55},{"uri":"Punishment","surface_form":"punishment","offset":186},{"uri":"Damnation","surface_form":"damnation","offset":250},{"uri":"Salvation_(Christianity)","surface_form":"salvation","offset":303}]}
