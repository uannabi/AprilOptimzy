{"id":82369,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(weapon)","text":"=\"preserve\">A sling is a type of weapon which involves swinging a rock round to gain speed before throwing it. The sling is an ancient weapon which was used in the Roman Empire. A skillful slinger can hit a target 10x10 cm at 20 metres distance. A sling has operational range for some 200 metres.\nThe most famous user of sling was David, the future king of Israel, who killed Goliath by slinging a stone on his forehead.\nIn the Middle Ages, Spanish peasants used slings against Moorish cavalry. A hit on the horse's head could kill the horse.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":33},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":164},{"uri":"David","surface_form":"David","offset":331},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":357},{"uri":"Goliath","surface_form":"Goliath","offset":376},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":428},{"uri":"Moor","surface_form":"Moor","offset":478},{"uri":"Cavalry","surface_form":"cavalry","offset":486}]}
