The champion was Fernando Alonso in a close battle. Renault won the constructor's championship.\nTeam changes.\nFour prominent names in the sport disappeared for this season, with Minardi, Sauber, BAR and Jordan withdrawing, and one new team, Super Aguri entered at the last moment.\nThe Sauber name remained, although largely as a sentiment, as BMW owned 80% of the team to Peter Sauber's 20%. Jordan became MF1 Racing, as Midland started afresh after a disappointing first season under the Jordan name. Late in the season, the team was bought by Spyker. Honda, who already owned a 45% stake in the BAR team, completed their takeover of the team and changed its name to Honda Racing F1 Team at the start of the season.\nSuper Aguri F1 also entered their first season after having problems entering. They received backing from Honda Racing F1 including technology and engines, due to them running Honda driver Takuma Sato.\nWilliams introduced numerous changes for 2006, particularly changing to Cosworth V8 engines after they and BMW split. Red Bull Racing (RBR) had Ferrari engines, replacing the Cosworth power which gained them seventh in the standings in 2005. Williams and Toyota changed tyre suppliers to Bridgestone, due to Michelin's desire to supply fewer teams in the championship. Despite this Toro Rosso who under the Minardi name ran Bridgestone tyres switched to Michelin in line with parent team RBR.\nDriver changes.\nAt The Start of the Season\nResults and standings.\nIn the 2006 Formula One calendar the Australian Grand Prix was put back to a few weeks to avoid a clash with the 2006 Commonwealth Games. For the first time, Bahrain hosted the first Grand Prix. Brazil hosted the last race and Japan and China swapped their original dates.\nDrivers.\n(*) Driver did not finish the race but was classified, having raced more than 90% of race distance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fernando_Alonso","surface_form":"Fernando Alonso","offset":101},{"uri":"Renault_F1","surface_form":"Renault","offset":136},{"uri":"Constructor%27s_championship","surface_form":"constructor's championship","offset":152},{"uri":"Minardi","surface_form":"Minardi","offset":262},{"uri":"Sauber","surface_form":"Sauber","offset":271},{"uri":"British_American_Racing","surface_form":"BAR","offset":279},{"uri":"Jordan_Grand_Prix","surface_form":"Jordan","offset":287},{"uri":"Super_Aguri","surface_form":"Super Aguri","offset":325},{"uri":"BMW","surface_form":"BMW","offset":427},{"uri":"MF1_Racing","surface_form":"MF1 Racing","offset":490},{"uri":"Spyker","surface_form":"Spyker","offset":629},{"uri":"Super_Aguri_F1","surface_form":"Super Aguri F1","offset":801},{"uri":"Honda_Racing_F1","surface_form":"Honda Racing F1","offset":907},{"uri":"Takuma_Sato","surface_form":"Takuma Sato","offset":990},{"uri":"WilliamsF1","surface_form":"Williams","offset":1003},{"uri":"Cosworth","surface_form":"Cosworth","offset":1075},{"uri":"V8","surface_form":"V8","offset":1084},{"uri":"BMW","surface_form":"BMW","offset":1110},{"uri":"Red_Bull_Racing","surface_form":"Red Bull Racing","offset":1121},{"uri":"Scuderia_Ferrari","surface_form":"Ferrari","offset":1147},{"uri":"WilliamsF1","surface_form":"Williams","offset":1245},{"uri":"Toyota_F1","surface_form":"Toyota","offset":1258},{"uri":"Bridgestone","surface_form":"Bridgestone","offset":1291},{"uri":"Michelin","surface_form":"Michelin","offset":1311},{"uri":"Bridgestone","surface_form":"Bridgestone","offset":1427},{"uri":"Michelin","surface_form":"Michelin","offset":1457},{"uri":"2006_Commonwealth_Games","surface_form":"2006 Commonwealth Games","offset":1675}]}
