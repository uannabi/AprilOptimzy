{"id":82508,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layla","text":"Layla is a song by Derek and the Dominos. The song first appeared on the album \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\". This song clocks in at 7 minutes and 4 seconds, and it is split into two sections. The first section has the unmistakable guitar riff, which has two parts to it. The first part is played on a Brownie guitar by Eric Clapton. The next part that comes in is played on a Gibson Les Paul by Duane Allman. Clapton also sings the lead vocals. Bobby Whitlock sings the backup vocals, and he plays the keyboard. Carl Radle plays the bass, and Jim Gordon plays the drums. He plays the piano part in the second segment, and Allman plays the slide guitar during the piano exit part. Eric Clapton plays the acoustic guitar, which augments the piano. While Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" builds from a quiet introduction to a hard rock finale, \"Layla\" does pretty much the opposite. The \"bird call\" sound at the end of the song is made by Allman on the slide guitar.\nThis song was dedicated to Pattie Boyd, who was already married to George Harrison. The lyrics have something to do with unrequited love. The song was also named after a fictional character in a movie.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":11},{"uri":"Derek_and_the_Dominos","surface_form":"Derek and the Dominos","offset":19},{"uri":"Layla_and_Other_Assorted_Love_Songs","surface_form":"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs","offset":80},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":240},{"uri":"Riff","surface_form":"riff","offset":247},{"uri":"Brownie_(guitar)","surface_form":"Brownie","offset":310},{"uri":"Eric_Clapton","surface_form":"Eric Clapton","offset":328},{"uri":"Gibson_Les_Paul","surface_form":"Gibson Les Paul","offset":385},{"uri":"Duane_Allman","surface_form":"Duane Allman","offset":404},{"uri":"Bobby_Whitlock","surface_form":"Bobby Whitlock","offset":454},{"uri":"Organ_(music)","surface_form":"keyboard","offset":511},{"uri":"Carl_Radle","surface_form":"Carl Radle","offset":521},{"uri":"Jim_Gordon_(musician)","surface_form":"Jim Gordon","offset":552},{"uri":"Acoustic_guitar","surface_form":"acoustic guitar","offset":712},{"uri":"Led_Zeppelin","surface_form":"Led Zeppelin","offset":761},{"uri":"Stairway_to_Heaven","surface_form":"Stairway to Heaven","offset":777},{"uri":"Pattie_Boyd","surface_form":"Pattie Boyd","offset":1003},{"uri":"George_Harrison","surface_form":"George Harrison","offset":1043},{"uri":"Unrequited_love","surface_form":"unrequited love","offset":1097},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"fictional character","offset":1146},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":1171}]}
