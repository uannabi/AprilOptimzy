{"id":8253,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll","text":"Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Daresbury, Cheshire, 27 January 1832 \u2013 Guildford, Surrey, 14 January 1898). Dodgson was an Oxford don, a logician (mathematics expert), a writer, a poet, an Anglican clergyman, and a photographer. He is most famous for his story \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" which he told to a young friend, Alice Liddell, when he took the girl and two sisters on a boat trip. Alice enjoyed the story and asked Dodgson to write it down. Carroll then wrote a second story about Alice called \"Through the Looking-Glass\". Both stories are still popular all over the world.\nDodgson was a Fellow of Christ Church, Oxford, specialising in logic and mathematics. He wrote a number of books and pamphlets on the subject. He died of pneumonia in Guildford, Surrey.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pen_name","surface_form":"pen name","offset":22},{"uri":"Daresbury","surface_form":"Daresbury","offset":60},{"uri":"Cheshire","surface_form":"Cheshire","offset":71},{"uri":"Guildford","surface_form":"Guildford","offset":99},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":110},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"Oxford don","offset":151},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":165},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":175},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":208},{"uri":"Anglican","surface_form":"Anglican","offset":217},{"uri":"Clergyman","surface_form":"clergyman","offset":226},{"uri":"Photographer","surface_form":"photographer","offset":243},{"uri":"Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland","surface_form":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","offset":290},{"uri":"Alice_Liddell","surface_form":"Alice Liddell","offset":357},{"uri":"Boat","surface_form":"boat","offset":415},{"uri":"Through_the_Looking-Glass","surface_form":"Through the Looking-Glass","offset":540},{"uri":"Fellow","surface_form":"Fellow","offset":633},{"uri":"Christ_Church%2C_Oxford","surface_form":"Christ Church, Oxford","offset":643},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":682},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":692},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":773},{"uri":"Guildford","surface_form":"Guildford","offset":786},{"uri":"Surrey","surface_form":"Surrey","offset":797}]}
