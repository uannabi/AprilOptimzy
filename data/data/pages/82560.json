{"id":82560,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glosa","text":"=\"preserve\">Glosa is a term that was often used by Spanish musicians in the 16th century to mean: a piece of music which was similar to a set of variations. Composers at that time often wrote collections of glosas. The term is related to the word \u201Cgloss\u201D. They were comparing it to gloss (ornamentation) that a poet might put on his poem. They were often on religious themes.\nAntonio de Cabez\u00F3n was an important composer of glosas.\nGlosa was also used by Spanish musicians to mean: musical ornamentation. This is the meaning in the title of a famous book of music for viola da gamba and harpsichord by Diego Ortiz called \"Trattado de glosas\" (1553).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":51},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":59},{"uri":"16th_century","surface_form":"16th century","offset":76},{"uri":"Variations_(music)","surface_form":"variations","offset":145},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":311},{"uri":"Poem","surface_form":"poem","offset":333},{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":358},{"uri":"Antonio_de_Cabez%C3%B3n","surface_form":"Antonio de Cabez\u00F3n","offset":376},{"uri":"Ornamentation_(music)","surface_form":"ornamentation","offset":490},{"uri":"Viola_da_gamba","surface_form":"viola da gamba","offset":568},{"uri":"Harpsichord","surface_form":"harpsichord","offset":587},{"uri":"Diego_Ortiz","surface_form":"Diego Ortiz","offset":602},{"uri":"1553","surface_form":"1553","offset":643}]}
