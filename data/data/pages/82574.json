{"id":82574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc%C3%BAn","text":"Canc\u00FAn (pronounced as) is a coastal city in Mexico's easternmost state, Quintana Roo, on the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula. About 573,000 people live in Canc\u00FAn, but over 4,000,000 tourists visit Canc\u00FAn every year on vacation. At present it is, with Acapulco, the Mexican resort best known in the world.\nThe resort is entirely artificial: few lived here before 1970. The first hotels were funded by the government. February to May is wonderful weather most of the time, and there are stunning white sand beaches. Even the sea is warm. There is now an airport, and bus connections to the rest of the Yucat\u00E1n. The Yucat\u00E1n has many Mayan sites, and some villages which are still mostly Mayan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Coast","surface_form":"coast","offset":28},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":36},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":44},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":65},{"uri":"Quintana_Roo","surface_form":"Quintana Roo","offset":72},{"uri":"Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula","surface_form":"Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula","offset":93},{"uri":"Tourist","surface_form":"tourist","offset":168},{"uri":"Vacation","surface_form":"vacation","offset":204},{"uri":"Acapulco","surface_form":"Acapulco","offset":237},{"uri":"Mayan","surface_form":"Mayan","offset":616}]}
