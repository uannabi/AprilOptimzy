{"id":82579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)","text":"Landfall is when a tropical cyclone or waterspout moves from being over water to being over land. When a tornadic waterspout makes landfall it can be called a tornado, and can cause damage to buildings and other things made by people. When a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it quickly spreads out and loses its energy; the water falls as rain.\nTogether with the high surf, these can cause a lot of beach erosion. In low lying areas the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic mess. When a tropical cyclone makes landfall, the eye \"closes\", surf gets less, and winds get less as the cyclone spreads out, losing energy. Damage inland may include flooding rains, gusty winds, and severe weather associated with the cyclone's remnant thunderstorms.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical cyclone","offset":19},{"uri":"Waterspout","surface_form":"waterspout","offset":39},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":72},{"uri":"Land","surface_form":"land","offset":92},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":114},{"uri":"Tornado","surface_form":"tornado","offset":159},{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":192},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":247},{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":318},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":345},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":405},{"uri":"Erosion","surface_form":"erosion","offset":411},{"uri":"Low","surface_form":"low","offset":423},{"uri":"Time","surface_form":"time","offset":482},{"uri":"Chemical","surface_form":"chemical","offset":500},{"uri":"Toxic","surface_form":"toxic","offset":542},{"uri":"Thunderstorm","surface_form":"thunderstorm","offset":802}]}
