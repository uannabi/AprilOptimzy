{"id":82591,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_Fortuna","text":"19 Fortuna is one of the biggest main belt asteroids. It is made up of stuff similar to 1 Ceres: a darkly colored surface that is heavily space weathered and made up of primitive organic compounds, including tholins.\nFortuna is 225\u00A0km in diameter and has one of the darkest known geometric albedos for an asteroid over 150\u00A0km in diameter. Its albedo has been measured at 0.028 and 0.037.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope saw Fortuna in 1993. It was resolved with an apparent diameter of 0.20 arcseconds (4.5 pixels in the Planetary Camera) and its shape was found to be nearly spherical. Moons were searched for but none were detected.\nStellar occultations by Fortuna have been seen several times.\nIt was found by J. R. Hind on August 22, 1852 and named after Fortuna, the Roman goddess of luck.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"main belt","offset":33},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":43},{"uri":"1_Ceres","surface_form":"1 Ceres","offset":88},{"uri":"Space_weathering","surface_form":"space weathered","offset":138},{"uri":"Organic_compound","surface_form":"organic compound","offset":179},{"uri":"Tholin","surface_form":"tholin","offset":208},{"uri":"Hubble_Space_Telescope","surface_form":"Hubble Space Telescope","offset":392},{"uri":"Arcsecond","surface_form":"arcsecond","offset":486},{"uri":"Pixel","surface_form":"pixel","offset":502},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"Moons","offset":582},{"uri":"Star","surface_form":"Stellar","offset":630},{"uri":"Occultation","surface_form":"occultation","offset":638},{"uri":"John_Russell_Hind","surface_form":"J.
