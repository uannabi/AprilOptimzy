{"id":82594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_Massalia","text":"20 Massalia is a big and fairly bright Main belt asteroid. It is also the biggest member of the Massalia family of asteroids.\nCharacteristics.\nMassalia is an S-type asteroid. It orbits at very low inclination in the intermediate main belt, and is by far the biggest asteroid in the Massalia family. The remaining family members are pieces blown off by a cratering event on Massalia\nMassalia has an above-average density for S-type asteroids, similar to the density of silicate rocks. As such, it appears to be a solid un-fractured body, which is rare among asteroids of its size. Apart from the few biggest bodies over 400\u00A0km in diameter, such as 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta, most asteroids appear to have been fractured a lot.\nLightcurve analysis indicates that Massalia's pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (45\u00B0, 10\u00B0) or (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (45\u00B0, 190\u00B0) with a 10\u00B0 uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of 45\u00B0in both cases. The shape reconstruction from lightcurves has been described as quite spherical with large planar, nonconvex parts of the surface.\nDiscovery.\nMassalia was found by A. de Gasparis on September 19, 1852, and also found independently the next night by J. Chacornac. It was Chacornac's discovery that was announced first.\n\"Massalia\" is the Greek name for Marseille, where Chacornac made his discovery (de Gasparis was observing from Naples).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"Main belt","offset":39},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":49},{"uri":"Massalia_family","surface_form":"Massalia family","offset":96},{"uri":"S-type_asteroid","surface_form":"S-type asteroid","offset":158},{"uri":"Massalia_family","surface_form":"Massalia family","offset":282},{"uri":"Silicate","surface_form":"silicate","offset":468},{"uri":"1_Ceres","surface_form":"1 Ceres","offset":647},{"uri":"4_Vesta","surface_form":"4 Vesta","offset":659},{"uri":"Ecliptic_coordinate_system","surface_form":"ecliptic coordinates","offset":793},{"uri":"Axial_tilt","surface_form":"axial tilt","offset":896},{"uri":"Annibale_de_Gasparis","surface_form":"A. de Gasparis","offset":1092},{"uri":"September_19","surface_form":"September 19","offset":1110},{"uri":"1852","surface_form":"1852","offset":1124},{"uri":"Jean_Chacornac","surface_form":"J.
