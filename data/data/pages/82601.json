{"id":82601,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_Kalliope","text":"22 Kalliope is a big main belt asteroid of the M-type, found by J. R. Hind on November 16, 1852. It is named after Calliope, the Greek Muse of epic poetry.\nCharacteristics.\nKalliope is about 180\u00A0km in diameter but is not perfectly round, as shown by images from the VLT at the European Southern Observatory\nIts spectrum is M-type, but Kalliope does not appear to be metallic. It is similar to other M-types such as 21 Lutetia. Firstly, its density is far too low to be metal. Second, spectroscopic studies have shown evidence of hydrated minerals and silicates, so the surface is probably stony. Kalliope also has a low radar albedo, unlike most metallic surfaces.\nLightcurve analysis indicates that Kalliope's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (-23\u00B0, 20\u00B0) with a 10\u00B0 uncertainty, which gives Kalliope an axial tilt of 103\u00B0. Kalliope's rotation is then a bit retrograde.\nMoon.\nKalliope has one known moon, Linus, or (22) Kalliope I Linus. It is quite big: 30\u201340\u00A0km in diameter. It orbits about 1065\u00A0km from Kalliope. This is about 12 times the radius of Kalliope. Linus was found on August 29, 2001 by Jean-Luc Margot and Michael E. Brown, while another team also independently found the moon 3 days later.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"main belt","offset":21},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":31},{"uri":"M-type_asteroid","surface_form":"M-type","offset":47},{"uri":"John_Russell_Hind","surface_form":"J.
