{"id":82765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29_Amphitrite","text":"29 Amphitrite is one of the biggest S-type asteroids, probably third in diameter after Eunomia and Juno, although Iris and Herculina are similar in size.\nIt is probably not a fully solid body, since its density is too low for a solid silicate object and much lower than Eunomia or Juno. Its orbit is less eccentric and inclined than those of its bigger cousins - being indeed the most circular of any asteroid found up to that point - and as a consequence it never becomes as bright as Iris or Hebe, especially as it is much farther from the Sun than those asteroids. It can reach magnitudes of around +8.6 at a favorable opposition, but more usually is around the binocular limit of +9.5.\nAmphitrite was found by Albert Marth on March 1, 1854. It was the only asteroid he found. It is named after Amphitrite, a sea goddess in Greek mythology.\nA moon is suspected based on the lightcurve data.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"S-type_asteroid","surface_form":"S-type asteroid","offset":36},{"uri":"15_Eunomia","surface_form":"Eunomia","offset":87},{"uri":"3_Juno","surface_form":"Juno","offset":99},{"uri":"7_Iris","surface_form":"Iris","offset":114},{"uri":"532_Herculina","surface_form":"Herculina","offset":123},{"uri":"Silicate","surface_form":"silicate","offset":234},{"uri":"6_Hebe","surface_form":"Hebe","offset":494},{"uri":"Binoculars","surface_form":"binocular limit","offset":665},{"uri":"Albert_Marth","surface_form":"Albert Marth","offset":714},{"uri":"Amphitrite","surface_form":"Amphitrite","offset":798},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":827},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":846}]}
