{"id":82825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambhala","text":"=\"preserve\">In the Buddhist religion, Jambhala is the wealth-giving form of Avalokite\u015Bvara or Chenrezig, the bodhisattva of compassion.\nJambhala's blessings are to help others by eliminating poverty, so that they may practice the Dharma. There are five Jambhalas - Yellow Jambhala (overcomes pride), White Jambhala (overcomes attachment), Black Jambala (overcomes resentment), Green Jambhala (overcomes jealousy) and Red Jambhala (overcomes greed). For instance, the White Jambhala is shown sitting on a turquoise dragon and his left hand holds a mongoose that spews out precious jewels.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buddhist","surface_form":"Buddhist","offset":19},{"uri":"Avalokite%C5%9Bvara","surface_form":"Avalokite\u015Bvara","offset":76},{"uri":"Chenrezig","surface_form":"Chenrezig","offset":94},{"uri":"Bodhisattva","surface_form":"bodhisattva","offset":109},{"uri":"Compassion","surface_form":"compassion","offset":124},{"uri":"Poverty","surface_form":"poverty","offset":191},{"uri":"Dharma_(Buddhism)","surface_form":"Dharma","offset":230}]}
