He met Falla and the two musicians became lifelong friends. He moved to Paris in 1905 where he studied with Moskowski and d\u2019Indy. One of the his first works to be performed was piano quintet. The style was similar to C\u00E9sar Franck. Alb\u00E9niz heard it and advised the young composer to make his music sound Spanish.\nTurina\u2019s music started to be performed widely. In 1914 both Turina and Falla returned to live in Spain. They were two of the most important Spanish composers. He was choirmaster at the Teatro Real and he had an opera \"Jardin de oriente\" performed there. He became director of the Madrid Conservatory and received many honours.
