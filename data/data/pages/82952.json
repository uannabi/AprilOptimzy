Euler, becoming interested in the problem, wrote back to Goldbach saying that the weak conjecture would be implied by Goldbach's strong conjecture, saying that he was certain that the theorem was true (\"ein ganz gewisses Theorema\"), but he was unable to prove it.\nGoldbach's weak conjecture was later proved by Harald Helfgott in 2013, but Goldbach's strong conjecture has not been proved yet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Harald_Helfgott","surface_form":"Harald Helfgott","offset":363}]}
