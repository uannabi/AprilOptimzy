It was found by N. R. Pogson on April 15, 1857 and named after the Greek heroine Ariadne.\nCharacteristics.\nAriadne is very stretched out (almost twice as long as its smallest shape). It is a retrograde rotator, although its pole points almost parallel to the ecliptic towards ecliptic coordinates (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (-15\u00B0, 235\u00B0) with a 10\u00B0 uncertainty<a href=\"%23Kaasalainen02\">a></a>. This gives an axial tilt of about 105\u00B0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"main belt","offset":38},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":48},{"uri":"Flora_family","surface_form":"Flora asteroid family","offset":97},{"uri":"Norman_Robert_Pogson","surface_form":"N.
