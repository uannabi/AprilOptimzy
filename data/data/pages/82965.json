{"id":82965,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45_Eugenia","text":"45 Eugenia is a big Main belt asteroid. It is famous because it is one of the first asteroids to be found to have a moon orbiting it. It is also the second known triple asteroid, after 87 Sylvia.\nDiscovery.\nEugenia was found in 1857 by Hermann Goldschmidt. It was named after Empress Eugenia di Montijo, the wife of Napoleon III, and was the first asteroid to be named after a real person, rather than a figure from classical legend (although there had been controversy about whether 12 Victoria was really named for the mythological figure or for Queen Victoria).\nPhysical characteristics.\nEugenia is a big asteroid, with a diameter of 214\u00A0km. It is an F-type asteroid, which means that it is very dark in colouring (darker than soot) made up of carbonate. Like Mathilde, its density appears to be unusually low, indicating that it may be a loosely-packed rubble pile (an asteroid that has been broken apart by a collision and pulled back together by gravity).\nLightcurve analysis indicates that Eugenia's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (-30\u00B0, 124\u00B0) with a 10\u00B0 uncertainty, which gives it an axial tilt of 117\u00B0. Eugenia's rotation is then retrograde.\nPetit-Prince.\nIn November 1998, astronomers at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, found a small moon orbiting Eugenia. This was the first time a moon orbiting an asteroid had been found by a ground-based telescope. Eugenia's moon has been named (45) Eugenia I Petit-Prince, after Empress Eugenia's son, the Prince Imperial. The moon is much smaller than Eugenia, about 13\u00A0km in diameter, and takes five days to complete an orbit around it.\n2004 (45) 1.\nA second, smaller (estimated diameter of 6\u00A0km) moon that orbits closer to Eugenia than Petit-Prince has since been found and provisionally named S/2004 (45) 1. It was found by analyses of three images acquired in February 2004 from the 8.2\u00A0m VLT \"Yepun\" at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Cerro Paranal, in Chile. The discovery was announced in IAUC 8817, on 7 March 2007 by Franck Marchis and his IMCCE collaborators.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"Main belt","offset":20},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":30},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":116},{"uri":"87_Sylvia","surface_form":"87 Sylvia","offset":185},{"uri":"Hermann_Mayer_Salomon_Goldschmidt","surface_form":"Hermann Goldschmidt","offset":236},{"uri":"Empress_Eug%C3%A9nie","surface_form":"Empress Eugenia di Montijo","offset":276},{"uri":"Napoleon_III","surface_form":"Napoleon III","offset":316},{"uri":"12_Victoria","surface_form":"12 Victoria","offset":484},{"uri":"Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"Queen Victoria","offset":548},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":625},{"uri":"F-type_asteroid","surface_form":"F-type asteroid","offset":654},{"uri":"Soot","surface_form":"soot","offset":730},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":747},{"uri":"253_Mathilde","surface_form":"Mathilde","offset":763},{"uri":"Gravity","surface_form":"gravity","offset":952},{"uri":"Ecliptic_coordinate_system","surface_form":"ecliptic coordinates","offset":1039},{"uri":"Axial_tilt","surface_form":"axial tilt","offset":1124},{"uri":"Petit-Prince_(moon)","surface_form":"Petit-Prince","offset":1183},{"uri":"Canada-France-Hawaii_Telescope","surface_form":"Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope","offset":1234},{"uri":"Mauna_Kea","surface_form":"Mauna Kea","offset":1268},{"uri":"Hawaii","surface_form":"Hawaii","offset":1279},{"uri":"Satellite_(natural)","surface_form":"moon","offset":1301},{"uri":"Petit-Prince_(asteroid)","surface_form":"(45) Eugenia I Petit-Prince","offset":1450},{"uri":"Napoleon_Eugene%2C_Prince_Imperial","surface_form":"Prince Imperial","offset":1512},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":1583},{"uri":"2004_(45)_1","surface_form":"2004 (45) 1","offset":1645},{"uri":"Very_Large_Telescope","surface_form":"VLT","offset":1900},{"uri":"European_Southern_Observatory","surface_form":"European Southern Observatory","offset":1919},{"uri":"Cerro_Paranal","surface_form":"Cerro Paranal","offset":1955},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1973},{"uri":"Franck_Marchis","surface_form":"Franck Marchis","offset":2041},{"uri":"IMCCE","surface_form":"IMCCE","offset":2064}]}
