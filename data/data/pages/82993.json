Someone who is an expert in phonetics is called a phonetician.\nPhonetic theory regards the nature of sounds in speech (called phones) and how they are made, heard and thought of. Phonology, which came from it, studies sound systems and sound units (such as phonemes and distinctive features). Phonetics is one of the two parts of orthographical linguistics, the other part being spelling, differing from grammar and lexis.\nThere are more than 100 different phones recognized by the International Phonetic Association (IPA) and are shown in their writing system called the International Phonetic Alphabet.\nThe first time phonetics was studied was 2,500 years ago in what is now India, with, when he wrote about the place and manner of articulation of consonants in Sanskrit in his 5th century BC essay on Sanskrit linguistics. The major Indic scripts today order their consonants the way did.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":33},{"uri":"Science","surface_form":"science","offset":97},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":112},{"uri":"Speech","surface_form":"speech","offset":128},{"uri":"Expert","surface_form":"expert","offset":154},{"uri":"Phone_(phonetics)","surface_form":"phones","offset":262},{"uri":"Phonology","surface_form":"Phonology","offset":315},{"uri":"Phoneme","surface_form":"phoneme","offset":393},{"uri":"Distinctive_feature","surface_form":"distinctive feature","offset":406},{"uri":"Orthographical_linguistics","surface_form":"orthographical linguistics","offset":466},{"uri":"Spelling","surface_form":"spelling","offset":515},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":540},{"uri":"Lexis","surface_form":"lexis","offset":552},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Association","surface_form":"International Phonetic Association","offset":618},{"uri":"Writing_system","surface_form":"writing system","offset":682},{"uri":"International_Phonetic_Alphabet","surface_form":"International Phonetic Alphabet","offset":708},{"uri":"India","surface_form":"India","offset":813},{"uri":"Place_of_articulation","surface_form":"place","offset":850},{"uri":"Manner_of_articulation","surface_form":"manner of articulation","offset":860},{"uri":"Consonant","surface_form":"consonant","offset":886},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":900},{"uri":"5th_century_BC","surface_form":"5th century BC","offset":916},{"uri":"Indic","surface_form":"Indic","offset":972}]}
