{"id":83,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English","text":"e=\"preserve\">British English is the kind of English language which is used in the United Kingdom and in most countries which previously were in the British Empire.\nPronunciation in British English.\nIn the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example, a man from a place near London may not pronounce his \"r\"s the same as a man from Scotland or a man from Northern Ireland. Across the country, the accent is different. For instance, in Liverpool, people may speak with a \"scouse\" accent, in Birmingham with a \"brummie\" accent, and in London with a \"cockney\" accent. Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt. One place people speak English in a different way is Cornwall, where the Cornish dialect is spoken.\nOther languages.\nBritain, like other countries, has languages other than English. In Wales many speak Welsh; in Scotland some people speak Gaelic, and in Ireland a few people speak Irish. However, that is not the subject of this particular article.\nSpelling in British English.\nBritish English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English.\nVocabulary in British English.\nIn British English, \"dock\" refers to the water in the space between two \"piers\" or \"wharfs\". In American English, the \"pier\" or \"wharf\" could be called a \"dock\", and the water between would be a \"slip\".\nUsage in different countries.\nAmerican English is only an official language in the United States. In Canada, the accent sounds extremely similar to American English but with few exceptions (see Canadian English). The American spelling in Canada is sometimes used, but traditionally, the British Spelling (with the exceptions of some words like programme, -isation/-ise/-isable, chilli, etc.) is used. Although Commonwealth English is the most spoken, American English is seen more often on the internet. American English vocabulary dominates the visual media: \"movies\" (British: \"films\") and television.\nAll Commonwealth nations and Africa learn Commonwealth English, while American English is often learnt in the Americas and China. Z pronounced 'Zee' is only seen in the U.S.A and less commonly in Canada, while Z pronounced 'Zed' is spoken almost everywhere else. The United Kingdom and Ireland use British layout keyboards, while Australia, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S.A use American layout keyboards. In continental Europe English as a second language is nowadays sometimes even taught in American English, except perhaps in Scandinavia and the Netherlands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":44},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":82},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":148},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":309},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":366},{"uri":"Northern_Ireland","surface_form":"Northern Ireland","offset":389},{"uri":"Liverpool","surface_form":"Liverpool","offset":469},{"uri":"Birmingham","surface_form":"Birmingham","offset":524},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":567},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":790},{"uri":"Cornish_dialect","surface_form":"Cornish dialect","offset":810},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":922},{"uri":"Welsh_language","surface_form":"Welsh","offset":939},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":949},{"uri":"Gaelic","surface_form":"Gaelic","offset":976},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":991},{"uri":"Irish_language","surface_form":"Irish","offset":1018},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":1278},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":1470},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1523},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1541},{"uri":"Canadian_English","surface_form":"Canadian English","offset":1634},{"uri":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","surface_form":"Commonwealth","offset":2048},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":2479},{"uri":"English_as_a_second_language","surface_form":"English as a second language","offset":2486},{"uri":"Scandinavia","surface_form":"Scandinavia","offset":2588},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":2608}]}
