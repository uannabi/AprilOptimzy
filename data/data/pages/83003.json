{"id":83003,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A5M_Claude","text":"The A5M Claude was a Japanese fighter aircraft made by Mitsubishi. It first flew in 1935 and was introduced in 1937. It was the first monoplane (fixed-wing aircraft with one set of wings) that could work from an aircraft carrier. It was similar to the P-26 Peashooter, an American monoplane fighter. It fought in the second Sino-Japanese War. After the Pearl Harbor attacks, it was not good enough to fight against American fighters like the Curtiss P-40 and the F4F Wildcat, so it was replaced by the A6M Zero.\nNear the end of WW2, many A5M\u2019s were pulled out of retirement to be used as suicidal kamikaze aircraft.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":21},{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":30},{"uri":"Mitsubishi","surface_form":"Mitsubishi","offset":55},{"uri":"1935","surface_form":"1935","offset":84},{"uri":"1937","surface_form":"1937","offset":111},{"uri":"Monoplane","surface_form":"monoplane","offset":134},{"uri":"Fixed-wing_aircraft","surface_form":"fixed-wing aircraft","offset":145},{"uri":"Wing","surface_form":"wing","offset":181},{"uri":"Aircraft_carrier","surface_form":"aircraft carrier","offset":212},{"uri":"P-26_Peashooter","surface_form":"P-26 Peashooter","offset":252},{"uri":"United_States_of_America","surface_form":"American","offset":272},{"uri":"Pearl_Harbor","surface_form":"Pearl Harbor","offset":353},{"uri":"Curtiss_P-40","surface_form":"Curtiss P-40","offset":442},{"uri":"F4F_Wildcat","surface_form":"F4F Wildcat","offset":463},{"uri":"A6M_Zero","surface_form":"A6M Zero","offset":502},{"uri":"Kamikaze","surface_form":"kamikaze aircraft","offset":597}]}
