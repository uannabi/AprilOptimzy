The city's unofficial nickname is \u201CThe Loveliest Village On The Plains\u201D. This comes from a line in the poem \u201CThe Deserted Village\u201D by Oliver Goldsmith: \u201CSweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain...\u201D\nHistory.\nThe first settlers arrived in the winter of 1836 from Harris County, Georgia. The leader of these settlers was the judge John J. Harper. They wanted to build a town that would be the religious and educational center for this area.\nAuburn was firstly official mentioned on February 2, 1839. At this time it covered an area of. By that time, Methodist and Baptist churches and also a school were built. In the mid-1840s, different academies for boys and girls were founded in addition to the primary school. By 1858, of the about 1,000 free residents of Auburn, some 500 were students.\nIn 1856, the state legislature allowed to build a Methodist college, the East Alabama Male College in Auburn.

All of the schools and most businesses closed. Auburn was the site of a hospital for Texan Confederate soldiers.\nAfter the Civil War, Auburn went in a long depression. Public schools did not reopen until the mid-1870s. Most businesses remained closed. A series of fires in the 1860s and 1870s burned down the downtown area. East Alabama Male College was turned over to the state in 1872.\nIn 1892, the college became the first four-year college in Alabama where women are allowed to study.
