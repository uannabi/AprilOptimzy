{"id":83037,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_Europa","text":"52 Europa is an asteroid. It has a diameter of 289\u00A0km, and was found on February 4, 1858 by H. Goldschmidt. It is named after Europa, one of Zeus's conquests in Greek mythology. Europa is the seventh biggest asteroid by volume and the sixth biggest by mass (after Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea, and Interamnia) and contains somewhat less than 2% of the mass of the entire main belt.\nIt is a very dark carbonaceous C-type, and the fourth-biggest of these. It orbits close to the Hygiea asteroid family, but is not a member. Spectroscopic studies have found evidence of olivines and pyroxenes on the surface.\nLightcurve data for Europa has been very hard to interpret, so much so for a long time its period of rotation was in dispute (5 and a half, or 11 hours?) despite many observations<a href=\"%23Zappala83\">a></a>. It has now been determined that Europa is a prograde rotator, but the exact direction in which its pole points remains unclear. The most detailed analysis indicates that it points either towards about ecliptic coordinates (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (70\u00B0, 55\u00B0) or (40\u00B0, 255\u00B0) with a 10\u00B0 uncertainty <a href=\"%23Michalowski04\">a></a>. This gives an axial tilt of about 14\u00B0 or 54\u00B0, respectively.\nIt has been found that the star CV Aquarii found in 1934, was actually an incorrect misidentification of 52 Europa[http://www.aavso.org/publications/ejaavso/v28n2/103.pdf].","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":16},{"uri":"Hermann_Mayer_Salomon_Goldschmidt","surface_form":"H.
