This term simply means \"Path of Awakening\" and is thus a form of dharma.\nThe Dharma is one of the Three Jewels of Buddhism of which followers of Buddhism seek refuge in (what one relies on for his/her lasting happiness). The three jewels of Buddhism are the Buddha (mind's perfection of enlightenment), the Dharma (teachings and methods), and the Sangha (awakened beings who provide guidance and support).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":23},{"uri":"Buddha","surface_form":"Buddha","offset":59},{"uri":"Nirvana","surface_form":"enlightenment","offset":80},{"uri":"Dharma","surface_form":"dharma","offset":253},{"uri":"Three_Jewels","surface_form":"Three Jewels","offset":286},{"uri":"Buddha","surface_form":"Buddha","offset":446},{"uri":"Sangha","surface_form":"Sangha","offset":535}]}
