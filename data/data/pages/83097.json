She has become one of the most successful female country artists in history, with 25 number-one singles (a record for a female country artist) and 41 top-10 country albums (a record for any country artist). She is known for her top-three single \"Here You Come Again\" and the number-one hits \"9 to 5\" and \"Islands in the Stream\" (a duet with singer Kenny Rogers).\nHer 1967 song \"Dumb Blonde\" was heard by country singer Porter Wagoner, and he asked Parton to be a part of his television show. Her single \"Jolene\" reached number one in 1974, becoming a solo artist, though still performed and recorded with Wagoner.\nIn the fifty-four years since her debut, Parton has become one of the most famous country artists in the world.\nParton is the godmother of singer and actress Miley Cyrus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":51},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":61},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country","offset":82},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":96},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":103},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":115},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":125},{"uri":"Actor","surface_form":"actress","offset":137},{"uri":"Success","surface_form":"success","offset":177},{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"singles","offset":242},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":311},{"uri":"Kenny_Rogers","surface_form":"Kenny Rogers","offset":494},{"uri":"Porter_Wagoner","surface_form":"Porter Wagoner","offset":565},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":621},{"uri":"Debut","surface_form":"debut","offset":794},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country","offset":842},{"uri":"Miley_Cyrus","surface_form":"Miley Cyrus","offset":918}]}
