Its headquarters were in the old Palace of the \"Hereditary Grand Duke\" (the \"heir apparent\") of Hesse in Karlsruhe.\nAnother part, the 5th criminal division is based in the \"Villa Sack\" in Leipzig.

The judges did not want to move so instead only the 5th criminal division was moved from Berlin to Leipzig.\nThe 5th division used to meet in West Berlin so that appeal cases could be heard in the city without having to take criminals across the DDR. The Federal Administrative Court moved into the Villa sack as well on August 22nd, 2002.\nOrganisation.\nThe BGH is divided into \"senates\".
