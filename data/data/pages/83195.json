{"id":83195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Adolfo_B%C3%A9cquer","text":"Gustavo Adolfo Dom\u00EDnguez Bastida, better known as B\u00E9cquer, (Seville, 17 February 1836 \u2013 Madrid, 22 December 1870) was a Spanish post-romanticist writer of poetry and short stories. He is considered one of the most important figures in Spanish literature. He adopted the alias of B\u00E9cquer as his brother Valeriano B\u00E9cquer, a painter, had done earlier. He was associated with the post-romanticism movement and wrote while realism in literature was enjoying success in Spain. He was moderately well known during his life, but it was after his death that most of his works were published.\nHis best known works are the \"Rhymes\" and the \"Legends,\" usually published together as \"Rimas y leyendas\". These poems and tales are essential to the study of Spanish literature and common reading for high-school students in Spanish-speaking countries.\nHis work approached the traditional poetry and themes in a modern way, and is considered the founder of modern Spanish lyricism.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":60},{"uri":"Madrid","surface_form":"Madrid","offset":88},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":120},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"post-romanticist","offset":128},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":145},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poetry","offset":155},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":323},{"uri":"Realism","surface_form":"realism","offset":419},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish-speaking countries","offset":809}]}
