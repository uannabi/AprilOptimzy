In the 1930s, he made some successful movies like \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1934), \"The 39 Steps\" (1935) and \"The Lady Vanishes\" (1938). He then moved to the United States, to work in Hollywood. His first American movie was \"Rebecca\" (1940), which won an Academy Award.\nSome of his best known movies from the 1940s are \"Spellbound\" (1945) and \"Notorious\" (1946), which were inspired by psychoanalysis.
