{"id":8335,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation","text":"A mathematical equation is an expression containing two mathematical objects connected by an equals sign (=). The equals sign says that both sides are exactly equal, or of the same value. An equation can be as simple as x=0, or as complex as formula_1 or harder.\nThe second kind is often used to solve problems in which finding the value of some variables is involved. For example, if\nThe second kind of equation is used in algebra. For example, to solve the equation 2x = 8 for x, one would follow an algebraic rule to find that x = 4.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Equals_sign","surface_form":"equals sign","offset":93},{"uri":"Solve","surface_form":"solve","offset":296},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":424},{"uri":"Rule","surface_form":"rule","offset":512}]}
