{"id":83362,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/85_Io","text":"85 Io is a big, dark Main belt asteroid of the C spectral class. It is probably a primitive body made of carbonates. Like 70 Panopaea it orbits within the Eunomia asteroid family but it is not related to the shattered parent body.\nIo is a retrograde rotator, with its pole pointing towards one of ecliptic coordinates (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (-45\u00B0, 105\u00B0) or (-15\u00B0, 295\u00B0) with a 10\u00B0 uncertainty<a href=\"%23Torppa2003\">a></a>. This gives an axial tilt of about 125\u00B0 or 115\u00B0, respectively. Its shape is quite spherical.\nIt was found by C. H. F. Peters on September 19, 1865 and named after Io, a lover of Zeus in Greek mythology.\nA diameter of 178 kilometres was measured from an occultation of a star on December 10, 1995 <a href=\"%23Erikson99\">a></a>.\nIo is also the name of the volcanic moon of Jupiter. With a two-digit number and a two-letter name, 85 Io has the shortest designation of all minor planets.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"Main belt","offset":21},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":31},{"uri":"C-type_asteroid","surface_form":"C","offset":47},{"uri":"Carbonate","surface_form":"carbonate","offset":105},{"uri":"70_Panopaea","surface_form":"70 Panopaea","offset":122},{"uri":"Eunomia_family","surface_form":"Eunomia asteroid family","offset":155},{"uri":"Prograde_and_retrograde_motion","surface_form":"retrograde","offset":239},{"uri":"Ecliptic_coordinate_system","surface_form":"ecliptic coordinates","offset":297},{"uri":"Axial_tilt","surface_form":"axial tilt","offset":424},{"uri":"Sphere","surface_form":"spherical","offset":491},{"uri":"Christian_Heinrich_Friedrich_Peters","surface_form":"C.
