They are split into five castes, hatched by the state to fill preset positions in society. The lower castes, which are clones, are treated with chemicals to arrest their mental and physical development. Children are treated by a process which gives them only information appropriate to their caste. They are moulded for their positions in life. Psychological needs are met by compulsory dosing of the drug \"soma\", a hallucinogen which takes the user on an enjoyable trip.
