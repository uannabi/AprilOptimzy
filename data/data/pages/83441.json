{"id":83441,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90_Antiope","text":"90 Antiope is an asteroid found on October 1, 1866 by Robert Luther. The 90th asteroid to be found, it is named after Antiope from Greek mythology, though it is disputed as to whether the namesake is Antiope the Amazon or Antiope the mother of Amphion and Zethus.\nAntiope orbits in the farther third of the core region of the main belt, and is a member of the Themis family of asteroids. Like most bodies in this region, it is of the dark C spectral type, indicating that it is made of carbonaceous chondrite.\nThere have been 9 occultations observed since 1988, many of which are multichord occultations.\nDouble asteroid.\nThe most remarkable feature of Antiope is that it has two asteroids of almost equal size (the difference in mass is less than 2.5%), making it a truly \"double\" asteroid. Its binary nature was found on 10 August, 2000 by a group of astronomers using adaptive optics at the Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea. The \"secondary\" is designated S/2000 (90) 1.\nEach asteroid is about 86\u00B11\u00A0km across, with their centers separated by only about 170 kilometers. This means that the space separating the two halves is only 60\u00A0km, or so. The two bodies orbit around the same center of mass which lies in the space between them. The orbital period is about 16.50 hours, the eccentricity below 0.03 (best estimate 0.01 \u00B1 0.02). Every several years, a period of mutual occultations occurs when the asteroid is viewed from Earth. Using Kepler's third law, the mass and density of the asteroids can be derived from the orbital period and asteroid sizes.\nThe axis of the mutual orbit of the two asteroids points towards ecliptic coordinates (\u03B2, \u03BB) = (200\u00B0, 38\u00B0) with 2 degrees uncertainty. This is tilted about 63\u00B0 to the circumsolar orbit of the system.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet","Planet"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":17},{"uri":"October_1","surface_form":"October 1","offset":35},{"uri":"1866","surface_form":"1866","offset":46},{"uri":"Karl_Theodor_Robert_Luther","surface_form":"Robert Luther","offset":54},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":131},{"uri":"Namesake","surface_form":"namesake","offset":188},{"uri":"Antiope_(mythology)","surface_form":"Antiope the Amazon","offset":200},{"uri":"Antiope_(mother_of_Amphion)","surface_form":"Antiope the mother of Amphion and Zethus","offset":222},{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"main belt","offset":326},{"uri":"Themis_family","surface_form":"Themis family","offset":360},{"uri":"C-type_asteroid","surface_form":"C spectral type","offset":439},{"uri":"Carbonaceous_chondrite","surface_form":"carbonaceous chondrite","offset":486},{"uri":"Occultation","surface_form":"occultation","offset":528},{"uri":"Binary_asteroid","surface_form":"\"double\" asteroid","offset":773},{"uri":"10_August","surface_form":"10 August","offset":823},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":834},{"uri":"Adaptive_optics","surface_form":"adaptive optics","offset":871},{"uri":"Keck_Telescope","surface_form":"Keck Telescope","offset":894},{"uri":"Mauna_Kea","surface_form":"Mauna Kea","offset":912},{"uri":"Center_of_mass","surface_form":"center of mass","offset":1177},{"uri":"Johannes_Kepler","surface_form":"Kepler","offset":1434},{"uri":"Ecliptic_coordinate_system","surface_form":"ecliptic coordinates","offset":1616}]}
