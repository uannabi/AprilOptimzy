{"id":83479,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planform","text":"e=\"preserve\">In design planform or plan view is a vertical orthographic projection of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.\nIn aviation, a planform is the shape and layout of an airplane's wing. Of all the myriad planforms used, they can typically be grouped into those used for low-speed flight, found on general aviation aircraft, and those used for\nhigh-speed flight, found on many military aircraft and airliners.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Design","surface_form":"design","offset":16},{"uri":"Plan_view","surface_form":"plan view","offset":35},{"uri":"Orthographic_projection","surface_form":"orthographic projection","offset":59},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":112},{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":126},{"uri":"Aviation","surface_form":"aviation","offset":134},{"uri":"Fixed-wing_aircraft","surface_form":"airplane","offset":185},{"uri":"Low-speed_flight","surface_form":"low-speed flight","offset":286},{"uri":"General_aviation","surface_form":"general aviation","offset":313},{"uri":"High-speed_flight","surface_form":"high-speed flight","offset":359},{"uri":"Military_aircraft","surface_form":"military aircraft","offset":392},{"uri":"Airliner","surface_form":"airliner","offset":414}]}
