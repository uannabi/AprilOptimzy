{"id":83550,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_the_Dominican_Republic","text":"The Dominican Republic (Spanish: \"Rep\u00FAblica Dominicana\") is a country in the Caribbean. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of Hispaniola; Haiti occupies the western three-eighths of the island. The land border between these two countries is 388 km long.\nThe country has a total area of 48,671\u00A0km\u00B2; the part on the Hispaniola has an area of 48,215\u00A0km\u00B2 and the small Dominican islands have an area of 159\u00A0km\u00B2. The maximum length, east to west, is 390\u00A0km from Punta de Agua to Las Lajas, on the border with Haiti. The maximum width, north to south, is 265\u00A0km from Cape Isabela to Cape Beata.\nThe limits of the country are Haiti to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. Puerto Rico is to the southeast separated by the Mona Channel, of about 130\u00A0km wide. The capital, Santo Domingo, is located on the south coast.\nClimate.\nThe country has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the \"trade winds\" (winds that come from the northeast, from the Atlantic Ocean), which blow from the Atlantic all year long. The average yearly temperature is 25\u00A0\u00B0C with small changes from one season to another; the average temperatures change from one region to another, from 21\u00A0\u00B0C in the centre of the Cordillera Central to as high as 28\u00A0\u00B0C on the coastal plains. Temperatures very few times get above 32\u00A0\u00B0C; temperatures get below 0\u00A0\u00B0C only in the highest mountains in winter. The average temperature in Santo Domingo in January is 25\u00A0\u00B0C and 30\u00A0\u00B0C in July.\nThe rain season is from May to November. The average yearly rainfall is 1,346\u00A0mm, with extremes of 2,500\u00A0mm or more in the northeastern mountains and 500\u00A0mm in the southwestern valleys. The western valleys, along the Haitian border, remain relatively dry, with less than 760\u00A0mm of annual precipitation. The northwestern and southeastern extremes of the country are also very dry.\nFrom June to November (mainly from August to October), tropical storms and hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the country.\nIslands.\nSome of the cays are \"Cayos Siete Hermanos\" (in English, \"Seven Brothers Cays\"), close to the northwestern coast, and the cays of Saman\u00E1 Bay.\nMountains and Valleys.\nThe Dominican Republic is a country with many mountains; the highest peaks of the Caribbean are found here. The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast and they are separated by valleys with the same general direction.\nRivers and Lakes.\nThe Artibonite River is the longest river of the island but only 68\u00A0km are in the Dominican Republic.\nThe largest lake of the Hispaniola, and of the Caribbean, is the Lake Enriquillo. It is in the \"Hoya de Enriquillo\" with an area of 265\u00A0km\u00B2. There are three small islands within the lake. It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a saline lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water.\nOthers lakes are \"Rinc\u00F3n\" (fresh water, area of 28.2\u00A0km\u00B2), \"Oviedo\" (brackish water, area of 28\u00A0km\u00B2), \"Redonda\", \"Lim\u00F3n\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":62},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":77},{"uri":"Hispaniola","surface_form":"Hispaniola","offset":128},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":140},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":188},{"uri":"Kilometer","surface_form":"km","offset":247},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":644},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":680},{"uri":"Puerto_Rico","surface_form":"Puerto Rico","offset":708},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":797},{"uri":"Santo_Domingo","surface_form":"Santo Domingo","offset":806},{"uri":"Tropical_climate","surface_form":"tropical climate","offset":879},{"uri":"Elevation","surface_form":"elevation","offset":912},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":945},{"uri":"Average","surface_form":"average","offset":1055},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"year","offset":1063},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":1070},{"uri":"Season","surface_form":"season","offset":1119},{"uri":"Region","surface_form":"region","offset":1179},{"uri":"Coastal","surface_form":"coastal","offset":1276},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"plain","offset":1284},{"uri":"Santo_Domingo","surface_form":"Santo Domingo","offset":1433},{"uri":"Rainfall","surface_form":"rainfall","offset":1546},{"uri":"Tropical_cyclone","surface_form":"tropical storm","offset":1921},{"uri":"Hurricane","surface_form":"hurricane","offset":1941},{"uri":"Saman%C3%A1_Bay","surface_form":"Saman\u00E1 Bay","offset":2143},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":2224},{"uri":"Direction","surface_form":"direction","offset":2317},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":2373},{"uri":"Artibonite_River","surface_form":"Artibonite River","offset":2436},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":2581},{"uri":"Salt_water","surface_form":"saline lake","offset":2770},{"uri":"Fresh_water","surface_form":"fresh water","offset":2865},{"uri":"Salinity","surface_form":"brackish","offset":2907}]}
