{"id":8365,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine","text":"Olivine (or chrysolite) is a silicate mineral made of magnesium iron silicate with the formula (Mg,Fe)2SiO4.\nIt ranges in colour from chartreuse green to pale olive. In its gem form, it is called peridot.\nDunite is a rock of 90%+ olivine. Dunite and other peridotite rocks are major constituents of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about 400 kilometers. Dunite is rarely found on land, except where slabs of mantle rock from a subduction zone have been thrust onto continental crust.\nOlivine has also been found at several extraterrestrial locations, such as the moon and many passing space rocks - as well as the outer layers of dust orbiting young stars.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Silicate_mineral","surface_form":"silicate mineral","offset":29},{"uri":"Magnesium","surface_form":"magnesium","offset":54},{"uri":"Iron","surface_form":"iron","offset":64},{"uri":"Silicate","surface_form":"silicate","offset":69},{"uri":"Chartreuse_green","surface_form":"chartreuse green","offset":134},{"uri":"Olive_(colour)","surface_form":"olive","offset":159},{"uri":"Gem","surface_form":"gem","offset":173},{"uri":"Peridot","surface_form":"peridot","offset":196},{"uri":"Earth%27s_mantle","surface_form":"Earth's mantle","offset":303},{"uri":"Plate_tectonics","surface_form":"subduction zone","offset":430},{"uri":"Continental_crust","surface_form":"continental crust","offset":468}]}
