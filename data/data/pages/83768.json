{"id":83768,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Toro","text":"Raymond Toro, born on July 15, 1977 in Kearny, New Jersey. Toro is the lead guitarist and one of two backup vocalists for My Chemical Romance. He plays Gibson Les Paul guitars with Seymour Duncan pickups through Marshall amplifiers. He helped form the band in 2001 after reconnecting with frontman Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier.\nWhen he was younger he enjoyed the music of Queen, Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer and he cites Brian May and Randy Rhoads as large influences on his playing. Toro has said that he grew up listening to his brothers rock albums and has always wanted to play the drums, though he sticks to guitar with My Chemical Romance.\nOn April,13 2011, #SINGItForJapan was released as an effort to raise money for Japan after the tsunami. This project was started when Toro was inspired by kind words from their fans, and he went on to arrange much of the instruments to create a sound that closely emulated traditional Japanese music.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"July_15","surface_form":"July 15","offset":22},{"uri":"1977","surface_form":"1977","offset":31},{"uri":"Kearny%2C_New_Jersey","surface_form":"Kearny","offset":39},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":47},{"uri":"Guitarist","surface_form":"lead guitarist","offset":71},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"backup vocalists","offset":101},{"uri":"My_Chemical_Romance","surface_form":"My Chemical Romance","offset":122},{"uri":"Gibson_Les_Paul","surface_form":"Gibson Les Paul","offset":152},{"uri":"Seymour_Duncan","surface_form":"Seymour Duncan","offset":181},{"uri":"Pickup_(music)","surface_form":"pickups","offset":196},{"uri":"Marshall_Amplification","surface_form":"Marshall","offset":212},{"uri":"Instrument_amplifiers","surface_form":"amplifiers","offset":221},{"uri":"Queen_(band)","surface_form":"Queen","offset":381},{"uri":"Metallica","surface_form":"Metallica","offset":388},{"uri":"Megadeth","surface_form":"Megadeth","offset":399},{"uri":"Slayer_(band)","surface_form":"Slayer","offset":413},{"uri":"Brian_May","surface_form":"Brian May","offset":433},{"uri":"Randy_Rhoads","surface_form":"Randy Rhoads","offset":447}]}
