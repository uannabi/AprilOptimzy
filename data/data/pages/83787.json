{"id":83787,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","text":"The National Democratic Party () is a far-right political party in Germany. It is usually just called the NPD.\nIt was formed after the Deutsche Reichspartei dissolved in 1964.\nIt is not the same as the old Hessian Nationaldemokratischen Partei. That was one of the parties which joined to form the Deutsche Reichspartei in 1949.\nThe German government tried to get the NPD banned in 2003, but the Bundesverfassungsgericht threw the case out when some of the leaders of the party turned out to be agents or informers of German security services, including the Bundesamt f\u00FCr Verfassungsschutz, the \"Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution\", which still lists the NPD as a dangerous organisation because its policies are a threat to the peace and stability of Germany and the constitution. The NPD is also referred to as being Neo-Nazi, as it openly opposes Turks, blacks, gays and Jews.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Far-right_politics","surface_form":"far-right","offset":38},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":67},{"uri":"Deutsche_Reichspartei","surface_form":"Deutsche Reichspartei","offset":135},{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hessian","offset":206},{"uri":"Nationaldemokratischen_Partei_of_Hesse","surface_form":"Nationaldemokratischen Partei","offset":214},{"uri":"Bundesverfassungsgericht","surface_form":"Bundesverfassungsgericht","offset":396},{"uri":"Bundesamt_f%C3%BCr_Verfassungsschutz","surface_form":"Bundesamt f\u00FCr Verfassungsschutz","offset":558},{"uri":"Grundgesetz","surface_form":"constitution","offset":786},{"uri":"Neo-Nazi","surface_form":"Neo-Nazi","offset":837}]}
