{"id":83799,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/130_Elektra","text":"130 Elektra is a very big farther main belt asteroid. It was found by C. H. F. Peters on February 17, 1873 and named after Electra, an avenger in Greek mythology.\nIts spectrum is of the G type, so it is probably made up like Ceres. Spectral signatures of organic compounds have been seen on Elektra's surface\nRecent optical sightings have found a moon (see below). Using its orbit, Elektra's mass can be found more correctly. The value of 1.3 kg indicates an unusually high density (for asteroids) of 3.8 \u00B1 0.3\u00A0g/cm\u00B3. Optical sightings have also determined that Elektra's shape is quite non-spherical, as well as giving indications of albedo differences of 5-15% on its surface.\nMoon (S/2003 (130) 1).\nIn 2003, a small moon of Elektra was detected using the Keck II telescope. The diameter of the moon is 4 km and it orbits at a distance of about 1170\u00A0km. The moon has been given the provisional designation S/2003 (130) 1. Due to only a few sightings to date, its orbit is still not well known","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Planet","Planet   | bgcolour=#FFFFC0 | minorplanet = yes"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"main belt","offset":34},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":44},{"uri":"Christian_Heinrich_Friedrich_Peters","surface_form":"C.
