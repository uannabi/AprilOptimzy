{"id":83867,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Zug","text":"The Lake Zug (German: \"Zugersee\") is one of the lesser known Swiss lakes, on the outskirts of the Alps and north of Lake Lucerne. It is fed by the Aa, which descends from the Rigi and enters the south end of the lake. The Lorze feeds the lake at the northern shore.\nFor the most part, the lake is in the Canton of Zug, but the southern end is up to 10\u00A0km in the canton of Schwyz, while the Canton of Lucerne stretches over a 2\u00A0km area by the Immensee.\nAt its northern end the shores are nearly level, while on the west shore the wooded promontory of Buonas (with its castles, old and new) projects picturesquely into the waters. The principal place on the lake is the town of Zug. Three railways follow the shore of the lake, one from Z\u00FCrich via Zug and Arth-Goldau to the St Gotthard, one from Lucerne via Arth-Goldau to the St Gotthard and one from Z\u00FCrich via Zug to Lucerne.\nMany fish (including pike and carp of considerable weights) are taken from the lake, which is especially famous for an endemic kind of trout (\"Salmo salvelinus\", locally called \"Rolheli\"). Because of farming runoff, it is not one of Switzerland's cleanest lakes.\nHistorical notes.\nIn 1911, a railway was built around the lake.\nThe first steamer was placed on the lake in 1852.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":14},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Swiss","offset":61},{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":67},{"uri":"Alps","surface_form":"Alps","offset":98},{"uri":"Lake_Lucerne","surface_form":"Lake Lucerne","offset":116},{"uri":"Aa_River","surface_form":"Aa","offset":147},{"uri":"Rigi","surface_form":"Rigi","offset":175},{"uri":"Lorze","surface_form":"Lorze","offset":222},{"uri":"Canton_of_Zug","surface_form":"Canton of Zug","offset":304},{"uri":"Canton_of_Lucerne","surface_form":"Canton of Lucerne","offset":390},{"uri":"Immensee","surface_form":"Immensee","offset":442},{"uri":"Buonas","surface_form":"Buonas","offset":550},{"uri":"Zug","surface_form":"Zug","offset":676},{"uri":"Z%C3%BCrich_City","surface_form":"Z\u00FCrich","offset":735},{"uri":"Arth-Goldau","surface_form":"Arth-Goldau","offset":754},{"uri":"St._Gotthard","surface_form":"St Gotthard","offset":773},{"uri":"Lucerne","surface_form":"Lucerne","offset":795},{"uri":"Pike_(fish)","surface_form":"pike","offset":899},{"uri":"Carp","surface_form":"carp","offset":908},{"uri":"Endemic_(ecology)","surface_form":"endemic","offset":997},{"uri":"Trout","surface_form":"trout","offset":1013},{"uri":"1911","surface_form":"1911","offset":1162},{"uri":"Steamboat","surface_form":"steamer","offset":1215},{"uri":"1852","surface_form":"1852","offset":1249}]}
