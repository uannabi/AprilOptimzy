{"id":83937,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Night%2C_and_Good_Luck","text":"\"Good Night, and Good Luck.\"\u00A0is an Academy Award-nominated American 2005 movie directed by George Clooney. It was written by Clooney and Grant Heslov and is set in 1953. It portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti-Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\nThe movie, although released in black and white, was filmed on color film stock but on a grayscale set. It was later color corrected to black and white during post-production. It is about media responsibility. It also addresses what occurs when the media offer a voice of dissent against the government. The movie takes its title from the line with which Murrow routinely closed his broadcasts.\nTaglines: \"They took on the government with nothing but the truth\"; \"We will not walk in fear of one another.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Movie"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":35},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":59},{"uri":"2005_in_movies","surface_form":"2005 movie","offset":68},{"uri":"George_Clooney","surface_form":"George Clooney","offset":91},{"uri":"Grant_Heslov","surface_form":"Grant Heslov","offset":137},{"uri":"Edward_R._Murrow","surface_form":"Edward R.
