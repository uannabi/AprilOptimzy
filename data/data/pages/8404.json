{"id":8404,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netball","text":"Netball is a sport played in two teams of seven. It is like basketball except that bouncing the ball is not allowed. The player cannot step with the ball either, nor hold it for more than three seconds. The game proceeds by players throwing (passing) the ball to each other until one attempts to throw it through the hoop, known as a \"shot\".\nPlaying Court.\nA netball court is 30.5m long and 15.25m wide. The longer sides are called the side lines and the shorter sides the goal lines. The court is divided into three equal parts, a centre third and two goal thirds. These sections are marked by two transverse lines parallel to the goal lines. Each third measures 10.167m wide.\nThe goal circle is a semi\u2011circle 4.9m in radius and its centre is the midpoint of the goal line. The centre circle is 0.9m in diameter and is marked in the centre of the court.\nAll lines are part of the court and 50mm wide, preferably white. It is recommended that they are a textured, water\u2011based acrylic, straight and have clean, crisp edges.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":13},{"uri":"Basketball","surface_form":"basketball","offset":60},{"uri":"Ball","surface_form":"ball","offset":96}]}
