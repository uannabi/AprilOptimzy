It was first printed as a book in 1916. It tells the story of Stephen Dedalus, a young man who is trying to be a writer in Dublin. The story begins from his childhood and ends with him deciding to go to Paris and leave Dublin, his hometown, to become a writer.\nThe book is written in a new style of writing called stream of consciousness. Therefore, the beginning of the book is very simple while the later parts become less simple. It shows how, when a person grows up, the language he or she uses becomes more and more complex.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":47},{"uri":"Irish_people","surface_form":"Irish","offset":68},{"uri":"James_Joyce","surface_form":"James Joyce","offset":81},{"uri":"Dublin","surface_form":"Dublin","offset":217},{"uri":"Stream_of_consciousness_writing","surface_form":"stream of consciousness","offset":408}]}
