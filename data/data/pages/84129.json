{"id":84129,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake","text":"\"Finnegans Wake\" is the last book written by the Irish writer James Joyce. It was published in 1939.\nHe started to work on this book in 1924 and published parts of it under the titles \"A New Unnamed Work\" and \"Work in Progress\". He did not complete until seventeen years later, in 1939. During this time he faced many hardships, such as having no money, eye problems and family problems.\n\"Finnegans Wake\" is a very hard book to read, even for people who read a lot of literature, because Joyce uses several languages and creates new words that come from combinations of old and new English and other languages as well.\nIt can be understood as the story of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker and his family. But it is an experiment more than a story.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":29},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Irish","offset":49},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":55},{"uri":"James_Joyce","surface_form":"James Joyce","offset":62},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"publish","offset":82},{"uri":"Literature","surface_form":"literature","offset":468}]}
