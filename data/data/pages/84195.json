{"id":84195,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_(music)","text":"A pickup is a device that captures mechanical vibrations (usually from stringed instruments like the electric guitar, electric\nbass guitar or electric violin) and converts them to an electrical signal which can be amplified and recorded.\nThere are two main types of pickups. While piezo pickups are more common on acoustic guitars, and magnetic on electric ones, some guitars have both kinds.\nPiezo pickups contain a crystal that produces an electrical signal when physically vibrated.\nMagnetic pickups contain magnets with wire wrapped around them. When a metal string vibrates near the magnet an electrical signal is produced in the wire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Stringed_instrument","surface_form":"stringed instrument","offset":71},{"uri":"Electric_guitar","surface_form":"electric guitar","offset":101},{"uri":"Bass_guitar","surface_form":"bass guitar","offset":127},{"uri":"Electric_violin","surface_form":"electric violin","offset":142},{"uri":"Instrument_amplifier","surface_form":"amplified","offset":214},{"uri":"Sound_recording","surface_form":"recorded","offset":228}]}
