{"id":84292,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asshole","text":"Asshole (or arsehole in British English) is slang for the anus and is also used as a word to hurt people's feelings. It's made up from the word \"arse\", which has been used for a long time as another name for the anus. This was first added to the word \"hole\" about 1500 in books, but may have been used in talking a long time before that. By the 1970s, Hustler magazine featured people they did not like as \"Asshole of the month.\"\nHow it is used.\nAsshole is mainly used as a bad word towards someone that the speaker does not like.\nYou could not say \"asshole\" on normal television in the US until the early 1990s, but it was sometimes in PG-13 and R rated films before this.\nPolitical usage.\nIn 2000, during a Labor Day event, George W. Bush made an off-hand remark to his running mate, Dick Cheney, that \"New York Times\" reporter Adam Clymer was a \"major league asshole.\"\nRock songs using the word \"asshole\".\nGene Simmons of rock band Kiss released a solo album called \"Asshole\" which also featured a song of the same name. Denis Leary also had a song called \"Asshole\" in 1993.\nSimilar words.\nWords similar to \"asshole\" are \"asshat\", \"assclown\", \"asstard\", \"asspat\" and \"asspit\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British","offset":24},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":32},{"uri":"Slang","surface_form":"slang","offset":44},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":58},{"uri":"Anus","surface_form":"anus","offset":212},{"uri":"Hustler","surface_form":"Hustler","offset":352},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":569},{"uri":"PG-13","surface_form":"PG-13","offset":637},{"uri":"R_rated","surface_form":"R rated","offset":647},{"uri":"Labor_Day","surface_form":"Labor Day","offset":709},{"uri":"George_W._Bush","surface_form":"George W.
