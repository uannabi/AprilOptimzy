From 1571 to 1588 held a post in the treasury. He was descended from Jews who were made to converted to Catholicism after 1492. One of his forebears had been burned by the Inquisition for secretly continuing to practice Judaism. In 1599, he published the first part of \"Guzm\u00E1n de Alfarache\". It was a well liked book which was printed in at least sixteen editions in five years.\nIn 1571 he married Catalina de Espinosa. It was not a happy marriage. He was constantly in money difficulties and was imprisoned for debt at Seville at the end of 1602.\nIn 1608, Alem\u00E1n moved to America. It is said that he worked as a printer in Mexico. His \"Ortograf\u00EDa castellana\" (1609), published in Mexico, contains ideas for the reform of Spanish spelling. Nothing is known of Alem\u00E1n after 1609, but it is sometimes believed that he was still living in 1617.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":25},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":34},{"uri":"1547","surface_form":"1547","offset":41},{"uri":"1615","surface_form":"1615","offset":48},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":57},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":71},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":79},{"uri":"Graduation","surface_form":"graduated","offset":90},{"uri":"University_of_Seville","surface_form":"Seville University","offset":103},{"uri":"1564","surface_form":"1564","offset":125},{"uri":"Salamanca","surface_form":"Salamanca","offset":151},{"uri":"Alcal%C3%A1","surface_form":"Alcal\u00E1","offset":165},{"uri":"1571","surface_form":"1571","offset":178},{"uri":"1588","surface_form":"1588","offset":186},{"uri":"Treasury","surface_form":"treasury","offset":210},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jews","offset":242},{"uri":"Catholicism","surface_form":"Catholicism","offset":277},{"uri":"Inquisition","surface_form":"Inquisition","offset":345},{"uri":"1599","surface_form":"1599","offset":405},{"uri":"Guzm%C3%A1n_de_Alfarache","surface_form":"Guzm\u00E1n de Alfarache","offset":443},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":485},{"uri":"1571","surface_form":"1571","offset":555},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":643},{"uri":"Prison","surface_form":"imprisoned","offset":670},{"uri":"Seville","surface_form":"Seville","offset":693},{"uri":"1602","surface_form":"1602","offset":715},{"uri":"1608","surface_form":"1608","offset":724},{"uri":"North_America","surface_form":"America","offset":746},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":797},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":895},{"uri":"1609","surface_form":"1609","offset":946},{"uri":"1617","surface_form":"1617","offset":1009}]}
