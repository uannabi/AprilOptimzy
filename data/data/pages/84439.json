{"id":84439,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant","text":"The Ark of the Covenant (\u05D0\u05E8\u05D5\u05DF \u05D4\u05D1\u05E8\u05D9\u05EA in Hebrew: \"aron hab'rit\") is described in the Bible as a holy container where the Ten Commandments and other holy Israelite objects are held. According to the Bible, Yahweh commanded the ark be built when Moses had a prophetic vision at Sinai (Exodus 25:9-10). Some people believe the Ark contained Aaron's Rod, a jar of Manna, and the first Torah Scroll written by Moses, based on their reading of Book of Exodus,\u00A0Book of Numbers,\u00A0and the\u00A0Letter to the Hebrews. The first of the\u00A0Books of Kings\u00A0says that during the time of King\u00A0Solomon, the Ark held only the Ten Commandments.\nTerminology.\nThe Hebrew word \"aron\" is used in the Bible to designate any type of ark or chest, for any purpose (Genesis 50:26; 2 Kings 12:9, 10). The Ark of the Covenant is distinguished from all others by such titles as \"Ark of God\" (1 Samuel 3:3), \"Ark of the Covenant\" (Josh. 3:6; Hebrews 9:4), \"Ark of the Testimony\" (Ex. 25:22).\nThe Ark (aron kodesh in Hebrew meaning holy cupboard) is a raised cupboard found in Jewish Synagogues which contains the holy Torah scrolls. These are all written by hand and can take years to make. It is always on the wall of the Synagogue which faces towards Jerusalem.\nWhen the Ark is opened and the Torah removed for reading everyone stands in respect of God. During some prayers and services the Ark doors an inner curtain (parochet) are kept open.\nDescription.\nThe Bible describes the Ark as made of acacia or shittah-tree wood. It was a cubit and a half broad and high, and two and a half cubits long (about 130\u00A0cm \u00D7 78\u00A0cm \u00D7 78\u00A0cm or 4.29 \u00D7 2.57 \u00D7 2.57 feet, for Egyptian royal cubit was most likely used). The Ark was covered all over with the purest gold.\nRelated pages.\nMiddle Eastern: Israel\nPeople: Joshua, Samuel, Solomon","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":39},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":83},{"uri":"Ten_Commandments","surface_form":"Ten Commandments","offset":119},{"uri":"Israelite","surface_form":"Israelite","offset":151},{"uri":"Yahweh","surface_form":"Yahweh","offset":203},{"uri":"Moses","surface_form":"Moses","offset":242},{"uri":"Prophet","surface_form":"prophet","offset":254},{"uri":"Biblical_Mount_Sinai","surface_form":"Sinai","offset":274},{"uri":"Exodus","surface_form":"Exodus","offset":281},{"uri":"Aaron%27s_Rod","surface_form":"Aaron's Rod","offset":336},{"uri":"Manna","surface_form":"Manna","offset":358},{"uri":"Torah","surface_form":"Torah","offset":379},{"uri":"Book_of_Exodus","surface_form":"Book of Exodus","offset":436},{"uri":"Book_of_Numbers","surface_form":"Book of Numbers","offset":452},{"uri":"Letter_to_the_Hebrews","surface_form":"Letter to the Hebrews","offset":477},{"uri":"Books_of_Kings","surface_form":"Books of Kings","offset":517},{"uri":"King%C2%A0Solomon","surface_form":"King\u00A0Solomon","offset":561},{"uri":"Genesis","surface_form":"Genesis","offset":728},{"uri":"Books_of_Kings","surface_form":"2 Kings","offset":743},{"uri":"Books_of_Samuel","surface_form":"1 Samuel","offset":851},{"uri":"Epistle_to_the_Hebrews","surface_form":"Hebrews","offset":900},{"uri":"Acacia","surface_form":"acacia","offset":1456},{"uri":"Shittah-tree","surface_form":"shittah-tree","offset":1466},{"uri":"Cubit","surface_form":"cubit","offset":1494},{"uri":"Gold","surface_form":"gold","offset":1709},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":1730},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":1746},{"uri":"Joshua","surface_form":"Joshua","offset":1761},{"uri":"Samuel_(Bible)","surface_form":"Samuel","offset":1769},{"uri":"Solomon","surface_form":"Solomon","offset":1777}]}
