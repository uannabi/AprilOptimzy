{"id":84440,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cubit is the name for any one of many units of measure used by various ancient peoples and is among the first recorded units of length.\nThe cubit is based on measuring by comparing \u2013 especially rope and textiles, but also for timber and stone \u2013 to one's forearm length. The Egyptian hieroglyph for the unit shows this symbol. It was used through antiquity, the Middle Ages up to early modern times.\nThe distance between thumb and another finger to the elbow on an average person is about 24\u00A0digits or 6\u00A0palms or 1\u00BD feet (45.72\u00A0cm or 18\u00A0inches). This so-called \"natural cubit\" of 1\u00BD feet is used in the Roman system of measures and in different Greek systems.\nFrom late antiquity, the Roman \"ulna\", a four-feet-cubit (about 120\u00A0cm) is also known. This is the measure from a man's hip to the fingers of the outstretched opposite arm.\nThe English yard has a long legal history, but its origin is not known. The English ell is essentially a kind of great cubit of 15\u00A0palms, 114\u00A0cm, or 45\u00A0inches (3.75\u00A0ft).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":141},{"uri":"Rope","surface_form":"rope","offset":207},{"uri":"Textiles","surface_form":"textiles","offset":216},{"uri":"Timber","surface_form":"timber","offset":239},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":250},{"uri":"Forearm","surface_form":"forearm","offset":267},{"uri":"Hieroglyph","surface_form":"hieroglyph","offset":296},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"antiquity","offset":359},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":374},{"uri":"Modern_world","surface_form":"early modern times","offset":392},{"uri":"Thumb","surface_form":"thumb","offset":433},{"uri":"Elbow","surface_form":"elbow","offset":465},{"uri":"Roman","surface_form":"Roman","offset":615},{"uri":"Yard","surface_form":"yard","offset":857},{"uri":"Ell","surface_form":"ell","offset":929}]}
