{"id":8450,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene","text":"Hygiene is the act of being clean. Washing the body to remove dirt and germs, brushing the teeth to keep them clean, shaving, using the toilet properly, and dressing correctly are some examples. Proper hygiene is often taught to children at a young age, and it becomes a habit. People who do not have good hygiene might smell bad, lose teeth, or become ill (sick).\nFirst proven use of the word in English was in 1677s. The word hygiene comes from the French word hygi\u00E8ne, which is the western version of Greek word \u1F51\u03B3\u03B9\u03B5\u03B9\u03BD\u03AE (\u03C4\u03AD\u03C7\u03BD\u03B7) - hugiein\u0113 techn\u0113, meaning \"(art) of health\", from \u1F51\u03B3\u03B9\u03B5\u03B9\u03BD\u03CC\u03C2 (hugieinos), \"good for the health, healthy\", in turn from \u1F51\u03B3\u03B9\u03AE\u03C2 (hugi\u0113s), \"healthful, sound, salutary, wholesome\". In ancient Greek religion, Hygeia (\u1F59\u03B3\u03AF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B1) was the daughter of Asclepius and represented health.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cleanliness","surface_form":"clean","offset":28},{"uri":"Dirt","surface_form":"dirt","offset":62},{"uri":"Pathogen","surface_form":"germs","offset":71},{"uri":"Toothbrush","surface_form":"brushing the teeth","offset":78},{"uri":"Shaving","surface_form":"shaving","offset":117},{"uri":"Toilet","surface_form":"toilet","offset":136},{"uri":"Dress","surface_form":"dress","offset":157},{"uri":"Ill","surface_form":"ill","offset":353},{"uri":"Greek_religion","surface_form":"Greek religion","offset":717},{"uri":"Asclepius","surface_form":"Asclepius","offset":769}]}
