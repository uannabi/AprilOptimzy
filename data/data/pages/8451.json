{"id":8451,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spork","text":"File:Spork.png|thumb|Van Brode Milling Company <a href=\"A%3E_application_drawing.\">a> application drawing.</a>\nA spork is a combination of a spoon and a fork to create a special tool used to eat. Most sporks are made from plastic. Many fast food chains use the spork, including Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco John's, and Taco Bueno. Many people dislike the spork because it cannot poke food as well as a fork nor hold liquids as well as a spoon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Spoon","surface_form":"spoon","offset":141},{"uri":"Fork","surface_form":"fork","offset":153},{"uri":"Eat","surface_form":"eat","offset":191},{"uri":"Plastic","surface_form":"plastic","offset":222},{"uri":"Fast_food","surface_form":"fast food","offset":236},{"uri":"Taco_Bell","surface_form":"Taco Bell","offset":278},{"uri":"Kentucky_Fried_Chicken","surface_form":"Kentucky Fried Chicken","offset":289},{"uri":"Taco_John%27s","surface_form":"Taco John's","offset":313},{"uri":"Taco_Bueno","surface_form":"Taco Bueno","offset":330},{"uri":"Liquids","surface_form":"liquids","offset":427}]}
