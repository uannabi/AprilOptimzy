{"id":8471,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill","text":"Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill KG OM CH TD FRS PC (30 November 1874 \u2013 24 January 1965) was an English politician. He was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twice, once during World War II, and again in the early 1950s.\nChurchill is the only person to have been a member of the British Government during both World Wars, and the last commoner (non-royal) to be granted a state funeral. He was also a soldier, journalist, and author. He won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1953.\nChurchill featured in two media polls. He was ranked as the greatest British prime minister of the twentieth century by 20 prominent historians, politicians and commentators. They were asked by BBC Radio 4's \"The Westminster Hour\" to rank the 19 prime ministers from Lord Salisbury at the turn of the century through to John Major in the 1990s. In a 2002 BBC 2 television poll, Churchill was ranked as the greatest Briton in history. A million votes were cast, and the voting was heavily influenced by public campaigns for various candidates.\nHe is the only British Prime Minister to have received the Nobel Prize.\nPersonal life.\nWinston Churchill was born on 30 November 1874 at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England, the home of the Dukes of Marlborough. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a younger son of the 7th Duke, and a leading Tory politician. His mother (n\u00E9e Jenny Jerome) was American.\nAs a boy, Churchill went to the famous Harrow School. He did not get good results, but said he was good at fighting.\nHe joined the British Army, in 1893. In 1896, he was transferred to Bombay, in what was the Indian Empire (British India). He fought in what is now Pakistan. After this, he fought in a war in Sudan, in 1898 as an officer in the cavalry. In 1899, he went to the Second Boer War in South Africa, to be a newspaper reporter. He was captured by the Boers, but managed to escape.\nIn 1900, he became a politician in the Conservative Party, and was elected to Parliament. In 1904, he changed parties and joined the Liberal Party, but later returned to the Conservative Party.\nHe married Clementine Hozier in 1908, and had 5 children named Diana, Randolph, Sarah, Marigold and Mary.\nWorld War I.\nIn 1910 Churchill became Home Secretary, one of the most important members of the government. In 1911 he was made First Lord of the Admiralty, which put him in charge of the Royal Navy. When World War I broke out, he stayed in that job. He organized an invasion in Gallipoli which went wrong, and because of this, he was made to leave the government. He joined the army and was sent to fight in France, although he was still a Member of Parliament. In 1917 he was made minister in charge of military supplies (Minister of Munitions).\nBetween the wars.\nAfter World War I, in 1919, Churchill was made Secretary of State for War, and Secretary of State for Air (aircraft). In 1920, he ordered the first air bombing in Africa when he bombed the Darwiish State, (also called Daraawiish State).\nIn 1921 he was in charge of the colonies as Secretary of State. Soon after, in 1922 he lost in an election. In 1924 he became a member of Parliament again, this time not as a member of any party. In 1925 he joined the Conservative Party again. He became Chancellor of the Exchequer (Minister of Finance) in 1924.\nAfter 1929, Churchill disagreed with many things the Conservative party believed in. He was not given any job in the government. Instead he wrote books. One was called \"Marlborough: his life and times\", about his famous ancestor John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough; another was \"A History of the English Speaking Peoples\", which was not published until after World War 2.\nWhen Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Churchill warned that Britain should strengthen its military and oppose Hitler. However, very few leaders agreed with him.\nWorld War II.\nAt the start of World War II, Churchill was again put in charge of the Navy. In 1940 the war was going badly for Britain. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned on May 10 and Churchill was given the job. Some people thought that Britain could not win the war, and that the British government should make peace with Hitler. Churchill was sure that Britain could win, and promised to continue the fight. He made famous speeches that are still remembered today.\nHe was friends with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt. He persuaded Roosevelt to give supplies to Britain, and to help Britain. He had many meetings with Roosevelt and with Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, after they came into the war. They were called the \"Big Three\".\nAfter the war.\nIn 1945, his Conservative party lost an election, and he stopped being Prime Minister. However, he became Prime Minister again in 1951, which he was until 1955.\nHe was knighted in 1953, and became Sir Winston, and also won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nIn 1955, he retired from being Prime Minister. In 1964, he retired from Parliament.\nIn 1963, President John F. Kennedy named him 'Honorary Citizen of the United States' but too ill to attend a White House ceremony, his son and grandson accepted the award.\nSir Winston died of a stroke at the age of 90, in 1965. When he died, his wife Lady Clementine Churchill and other members of the family were at his bedside.\nBooks.\nTitle (US Title) (Year of publication)","categories":[],"infobox_types":["officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_of_the_Garter","surface_form":"KG","offset":38},{"uri":"Order_of_Merit","surface_form":"OM","offset":41},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour","surface_form":"CH","offset":44},{"uri":"TD","surface_form":"TD","offset":47},{"uri":"FRS","surface_form":"FRS","offset":50},{"uri":"Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","surface_form":"PC","offset":54},{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":101},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":109},{"uri":"Prime_Minister","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":128},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":150},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":184},{"uri":"British_Government","surface_form":"British Government","offset":286},{"uri":"State_funeral","surface_form":"state funeral","offset":379},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":408},{"uri":"Journalist","surface_form":"journalist","offset":417},{"uri":"Author","surface_form":"author","offset":433},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_literature","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in literature","offset":452},{"uri":"Media","surface_form":"media","offset":513},{"uri":"Poll","surface_form":"poll","offset":519},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":556},{"uri":"20th_century","surface_form":"twentieth century","offset":586},{"uri":"BBC_Radio_4","surface_form":"BBC Radio 4","offset":681},{"uri":"Lord_Salisbury","surface_form":"Lord Salisbury","offset":754},{"uri":"John_Major","surface_form":"John Major","offset":807},{"uri":"BBC_2","surface_form":"BBC 2","offset":842},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize","surface_form":"Nobel Prize","offset":1089},{"uri":"Blenheim_Palace","surface_form":"Blenheim Palace","offset":1167},{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":1184},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":1197},{"uri":"Duke","surface_form":"Duke","offset":1222},{"uri":"Marlborough","surface_form":"Marlborough","offset":1231},{"uri":"Lord_Randolph_Churchill","surface_form":"Lord Randolph Churchill","offset":1256},{"uri":"Tory","surface_form":"Tory","offset":1330},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":1335},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1381},{"uri":"Harrow_School","surface_form":"Harrow School","offset":1430},{"uri":"British_Army","surface_form":"British Army","offset":1522},{"uri":"Bombay","surface_form":"Bombay","offset":1576},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"Indian Empire","offset":1600},{"uri":"British_India","surface_form":"British India","offset":1615},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":1656},{"uri":"Sudan","surface_form":"Sudan","offset":1700},{"uri":"Officer","surface_form":"officer","offset":1721},{"uri":"Cavalry","surface_form":"cavalry","offset":1736},{"uri":"Second_Boer_War","surface_form":"Second Boer War","offset":1769},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1788},{"uri":"Reporter","surface_form":"reporter","offset":1820},{"uri":"Boer","surface_form":"Boer","offset":1853},{"uri":"Politician","surface_form":"politician","offset":1904},{"uri":"Conservative_Party_(UK)","surface_form":"Conservative Party","offset":1922},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"Parliament","offset":1961},{"uri":"Liberal_Party","surface_form":"Liberal Party","offset":2016},{"uri":"Home_Secretary","surface_form":"Home Secretary","offset":2221},{"uri":"Admiralty","surface_form":"Admiralty","offset":2328},{"uri":"Royal_Navy","surface_form":"Royal Navy","offset":2370},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":2387},{"uri":"Gallipoli_Campaign","surface_form":"Gallipoli","offset":2461},{"uri":"Member_of_Parliament","surface_form":"Member of Parliament","offset":2623},{"uri":"Munitions","surface_form":"Munitions","offset":2718},{"uri":"Aircraft","surface_form":"aircraft","offset":2855},{"uri":"Darwiish_State","surface_form":"Darwiish State","offset":2937},{"uri":"Daraawiish_State","surface_form":"Daraawiish State","offset":2966},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonies","offset":3017},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","surface_form":"Chancellor of the Exchequer","offset":3239},{"uri":"John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough","surface_form":"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough","offset":3527},{"uri":"World_War_2","surface_form":"World War 2","offset":3661},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":3679},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":3709},{"uri":"Neville_Chamberlain","surface_form":"Neville Chamberlain","offset":3992},{"uri":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin D.
