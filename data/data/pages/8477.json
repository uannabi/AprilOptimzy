{"id":8477,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights","text":"The Golan Heights is a strip of land in northeastern Israel that was captured by Israel in the Six Day War of 1967. The United Nations has voted to ask Israel to pull its troops out of the Golan Heights. Syria and Israel still have not signed a peace treaty from that war, mostly because of the issue of the Golan. They almost reached a peace deal but they could not agree on where to draw the line, and what Syria would have to do in return. On the western edge of the Golan Heights is a range of extinct volcanos.\nIn January 2013, the Israeli government said it planned to build a wall along the eastern edges of the Golan Heights, on its border with Syria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":53},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":81},{"uri":"Six_Day_War","surface_form":"Six Day War","offset":95},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":120},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":506},{"uri":"Wall","surface_form":"wall","offset":583}]}
