His highest ranking (that is, the order in which it is shown how good he is in the sport at a certain time) was World No. 2.\nWhen he won the French Open in 1989, Chang had a well known semi-final match with Ivan Lendl. Before the match, most people thought Chang would lose because he was unseeded, and Lendl was ranked No. 1. At first Chang was losing, but he won the important third set. Starting then, Chang began to have leg cramps, but won the match through determination. Today, many people remember this game as one of his best matches when the name Michael Chang is mentioned.\nChang was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, United States. His parents are Taiwanese.
