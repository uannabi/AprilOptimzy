{"id":84829,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom","text":"An angstrom or \u00E5ngstr\u00F6m (symbol \u00C5) is a non-SI unit of length that is internationally recognized. It equals 0.1 nanometer (nm). It can be written in scientific notations as 1\u00D710\u221210\u00A0m (normalized notation) or (exponential notation) \u2014 both mean. It is sometimes used to express the sizes of atoms, lengths of chemical bonds and visible-light spectra, and dimensions of parts of integrated circuits.\nHistory.\nThe \u00E5ngstr\u00F6m is named after the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas \u00C5ngstr\u00F6m (1814\u20131874), one of the founders of spectroscopy who is known also for studies of astrophysics, heat transfer, terrestrial magnetism, and the aurora borealis.\nIn 1868, \u00C5ngstr\u00F6m created a spectrum chart of solar radiation that expresses the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum in multiples of one ten-millionth of a millimetre, or 1 metres. This unit of length later became known as the \u00E5ngstr\u00F6m, \u00C5.\nThe visual sensitivity of a human being is from about 4,000 \u00E5ngstr\u00F6ms (violet) to 7,000 \u00E5ngstr\u00F6ms (deep red) so the use of the \u00E5ngstr\u00F6m as a unit provided a fair amount of discrimination without resort to fractional units. Because of its closeness to the scale of atomic and molecular structures it also became popular in chemistry and crystallography.\nToday, the use of the \u00E5ngstr\u00F6m as a unit is less popular than it used to be and the nanometre (nm) is often used instead (with the \u00E5ngstr\u00F6m being officially discouraged by both the International Committee for Weights and Measures and the American National Standard for Metric Practice).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"%C3%85","surface_form":"\u00C5","offset":32},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":44},{"uri":"Unit_of_length","surface_form":"unit of length","offset":47},{"uri":"Nanometre","surface_form":"nm","offset":123},{"uri":"Scientific_notation","surface_form":"scientific notation","offset":149},{"uri":"Atom","surface_form":"atom","offset":289},{"uri":"Chemical_bond","surface_form":"chemical bond","offset":307},{"uri":"Spectrum","surface_form":"visible-light spectra","offset":326},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"integrated circuit","offset":376},{"uri":"Sweden","surface_form":"Swedish","offset":438},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":446},{"uri":"Anders_Jonas_%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m","surface_form":"Anders Jonas \u00C5ngstr\u00F6m","offset":456},{"uri":"Spectroscopy","surface_form":"spectroscopy","offset":514},{"uri":"Astrophysics","surface_form":"astrophysics","offset":560},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"heat","offset":574},{"uri":"Magnetism","surface_form":"magnetism","offset":601},{"uri":"Aurora_borealis","surface_form":"aurora borealis","offset":620},{"uri":"Solar_radiation","surface_form":"solar radiation","offset":683},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":718},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_radiation","surface_form":"electromagnetic radiation","offset":732},{"uri":"Electromagnetic_spectrum","surface_form":"electromagnetic spectrum","offset":765},{"uri":"Millimetre","surface_form":"millimetre","offset":829},{"uri":"Metre","surface_form":"metre","offset":846},{"uri":"Length","surface_form":"length","offset":867},{"uri":"Nm","surface_form":"nm","offset":1361}]}
