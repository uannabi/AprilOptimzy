{"id":8489,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translator","text":"=\"preserve\">A translator reads something written in one language and speaks it or writes it in another language. For example, they could read a book in French and then \"translate\" it into English. See translation for more information.\nIn order to convert meanings from one language into another one, translators must be able to know the target language deeply. They are conveying the original meaning of the source text or material to the second language. As a result, translators do not only convert words, which makes it more like an art than a science.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":56},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":152},{"uri":"Translation","surface_form":"translation","offset":201}]}
