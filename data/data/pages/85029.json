{"id":85029,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2006_Atlantic_hurricane_season","text":"Below is a timeline of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, listing all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was a season in which an El Ni\u00F1o event stopped much tropical cyclone activity, especially later in the season. The season officially began on June 1, 2006, and lasted until November 30. For convenience and clarity, in the timeline below, all landfalls are bolded. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included.\nThe graphical bar above gives a brief overview of storm activity during the season, and for convenience, the storm's maximum intensity is included as a color bar. Tropical Storm Zeta from 2005 persisted into 2006, therefore a January section has been included in the text timeline.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"2006_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2006 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":27},{"uri":"Landfall_(meteorology)","surface_form":"landfalls","offset":119},{"uri":"Extratropical_cyclone","surface_form":"extratropical transitions","offset":130},{"uri":"2006_Atlantic_hurricane_season","surface_form":"2006 Atlantic hurricane season","offset":185},{"uri":"El_Ni%C3%B1o","surface_form":"El Ni\u00F1o","offset":241},{"uri":"National_Hurricane_Center","surface_form":"National Hurricane Center","offset":613},{"uri":"Color","surface_form":"color","offset":881},{"uri":"Tropical_Storm_Zeta_(2005)","surface_form":"Tropical Storm Zeta","offset":892},{"uri":"January","surface_form":"January","offset":955}]}
