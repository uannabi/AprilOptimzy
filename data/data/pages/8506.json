{"id":8506,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom","text":"A sonic boom is created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound. When an airplane reaches the speed of sound, it makes a bang sound or an explosive noise it can be seen with the naked eye. This is often called \"breaking the sound barrier.\" The visible part of a sonic boom is actually air that becomes squashed by sound waves. The thunder that a storm makes is also a sonic boom caused by lightning forcing air to move faster than the speed of sound.\nThe first plane to travel at the speed of sound was the Bell X-1 in 1947 and was piloted by Chuck Yeager.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":72},{"uri":"Naked_eye","surface_form":"naked eye","offset":192},{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound waves","offset":328},{"uri":"Thunder","surface_form":"thunder","offset":345},{"uri":"Bell_X-1","surface_form":"Bell X-1","offset":521},{"uri":"1947","surface_form":"1947","offset":533},{"uri":"Chuck_Yeager","surface_form":"Chuck Yeager","offset":557}]}
