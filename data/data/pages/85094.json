{"id":85094,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records","text":"Capitol Records is an American major record label based in Hollywood, California. It was founded in 1942 by musician Johnny Mercer, with partners Buddy DeSylva and Glenn Wallichs. The company was later bought by EMI, a company based in England. The buyout gave Capitol's American recording artists an outlet for their records in England and Europe, while EMI's artists could sell their works in America.\nCapitol's biggest-selling \"imported\" artist is The Beatles. When the Beatles had their first hits in England and Europe, Capitol Records did not want to market their recordings. Record producer George Martin turned instead to other American labels, trying to give the Beatles a hit record in America. Their records did not sell well in America at first, but \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" became a hit through radio airplay of a British copy. Capitol Records changed their minds, released \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", and it became a best-seller. Capitol then became the exclusive record label for the Beatles in America. When Universal Music sold Parlophone (the Beatles' British label) to Warner Music Group, Universal moved the Beatles' music to Capitol Records worldwide.\nCapitol's Hollywood headquarters is in a building called the Capitol Tower. It is round, and built to resemble a stack of records. The building houses offices, and also Capitol's own recording studio, with large echo chambers under the building.\nToday Capitol Records supervises many smaller record labels. Capitol and UMG are part of a larger company, named Vivendi.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Record_label","surface_form":"record label","offset":37},{"uri":"Hollywood","surface_form":"Hollywood","offset":59},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":70},{"uri":"1942","surface_form":"1942","offset":100},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":108},{"uri":"Johnny_Mercer","surface_form":"Johnny Mercer","offset":117},{"uri":"EMI","surface_form":"EMI","offset":212},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":236},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":271},{"uri":"Recording_artist","surface_form":"recording artist","offset":280},{"uri":"Outlet","surface_form":"outlet","offset":301},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":451},{"uri":"Record_producer","surface_form":"Record producer","offset":582},{"uri":"George_Martin","surface_form":"George Martin","offset":598},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":810},{"uri":"Airplay","surface_form":"airplay","offset":816},{"uri":"Exclusive","surface_form":"exclusive","offset":970},{"uri":"Parlophone","surface_form":"Parlophone","offset":1047},{"uri":"Warner_Music_Group","surface_form":"Warner Music Group","offset":1090},{"uri":"Vinyl_record","surface_form":"records","offset":1297},{"uri":"Recording_studio","surface_form":"recording studio","offset":1358},{"uri":"Echo_chamber","surface_form":"echo chamber","offset":1387},{"uri":"Vivendi","surface_form":"Vivendi","offset":1534}]}
