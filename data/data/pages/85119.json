{"id":85119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_190","text":"The Fw 190 was a German fighter aircraft made by Focke-Wulf during World War II. It first flew in 1939 and was introduced in 1941. Even though it was not sleek, it could still go 408\u00A0miles per hour (653\u00A0kilometers per hour). It was also called the Shrike and the Butcher Bird.\nIn 1942, Luftwaffe pilot Armin Faber landed by accident at a British airfield. They were then able to find out things about the aircraft.\nThe FW 190 was 29\u00A0feet (8.84\u00A0meters) long, had a wingspan of 34\u00A0feet 5.5\u00A0inches (10.49\u00A0meters), was 13\u00A0feet (3.96\u00A0meters) high, weighed 7,055\u00A0pounds (3,200 kilograms) empty and 10,800\u00A0pounds (4,900 kilograms) operational. It could go 408\u00A0miles per hour (653\u00A0kilometers per hour), could fly up to 37,400\u00A0feet (11,410\u00A0meters), and could go 560\u00A0miles (900\u00A0kilometers) without refueling.\nFW 109 was 1500 kg heavier than Bf 109. It was also faster (FW 190 A-8 was 16 kph faster than Bf 109 G-6) but it didn't climb as fast as Bf 109 (at 15 m/s compared to 17 m/s of Bf 109). FW 190 was much better armed than Bf 109 - it had 2 machine guns above the engine and four cannons in the wings. Bf 109 had only one cannon and two machine guns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":17},{"uri":"Fighter_aircraft","surface_form":"fighter aircraft","offset":24},{"uri":"Focke-Wulf","surface_form":"Focke-Wulf","offset":49},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":67},{"uri":"Luftwaffe","surface_form":"Luftwaffe","offset":286},{"uri":"Armin_Faber","surface_form":"Armin Faber","offset":302},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":338}]}
