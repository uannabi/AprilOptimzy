{"id":8517,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control","text":"Birth control, also known as contraception or family planning, is a way for a man and woman to have sexual intercourse and avoid pregnancy.\nSome contraceptives, such as condoms, will also protect a person from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). When people use contraception to prevent STDs and pregnancy, it may be called \"safe sex\".\nBirth control is also sometimes called \"family planning\". It means people can have babies or not as they wish. That way, babies and families do not happen by accident.\nThe need for birth control.\nBirth control lets a man and woman have sexual intercourse but makes pregnancy less likely.\nDuring intercourse, a man places his penis in a woman's vagina and moves it in and out while the woman moves her hips. The vagina is warm and soft, and it places pressure on the man's penis. These sensations, combined with the in-and-out movements, stimulate the penis, which causes the man to have an orgasm. During orgasm, the man's penis spasms and experiences a series of rhythmic contractions during which he ejaculates (releases semen into the vagina). The semen can make the woman pregnant. Because intercourse is usually very enjoyable, men and women often want to have intercourse a lot more often than they want to have a baby. Birth control lets them have intercourse while greatly reducing the chances of the woman getting pregnant.\nPeople may use birth control for several reasons. Perhaps a man and woman wish to have only a few children so they will have enough money to give those children good food, clothes, and education. More children might mean less for each child, so the parents use birth control to limit the number of children they have. Or maybe a man and woman do not want any children at all in order to focus on their own lives, jobs, or each other. Other couples may use birth control to make sure that they do not have too many children in too short a time, an idea that is called \"spacing\" their children. This may help them take better care of their children. Still another reason is that a young couple may not be able to afford having a baby until they are older and have more money or better jobs. This may be especially true of younger people who are still in school and probably not married. By using birth control, the couple can grow closer and strengthen their relationship by having sexual intercourse frequently so that when they are ready to have a baby their relationship is strong and stable. In most of these cases the man and woman want to have sex to be close, to feel good with each other, and to make their relationship stronger. Contraception lets them have intercourse while greatly reducing the chances of a pregnancy.\nBirth control may be used by married couples, or by couples who live together but are not married, or by a man and woman who are engaged, or by a couple who are merely boyfriend and girlfriend, or even by single people who are not in a relationship at all but who may have casual sex with others.\nTypes of birth control.\nThere are many types of birth control. Some of these have been done for a long time, but many of them were only discovered in the last eighty years. Each type of birth control has advantages and disadvantages. Another word for a type of contraception is a \"method\".\nBarrier methods.\nBarrier methods can be easy to use and have few side effects (bad things that happen if you take a medicine). Some of them can be bought without a doctor's prescription. Since they are easy to get and can help stop disease from spreading from one partner to the other, they are popular with younger couples or those who are early in a relationship. But sometimes they can be messy or interfere with the pleasure and sensation of sex.\nHormonal methods.\nThese can only be used by women. Doctors are trying to find a way to use hormonal methods for men. Hormonal methods change the woman's reproductive cycle in different ways so that it is safe for her man to ejaculate inside her.\nHormonal birth control is extremely effective if it is used in the right way. Many hormonal birth control methods also make women's menses shorter and with less bleeding, which most women like. And unlike barrier methods, hormonal methods do not interfere with sex. When a woman is using hormonal birth control, she and her man are usually not even aware of it during intercourse, which seems and feels very natural. The couple can have sex at any time they wish; they don\u2019t need to interrupt foreplay to put birth control in place, and they can feel the physical sensations and emotional closeness of intercourse without interference from a make or female condom. Unlike coitus interruptus (see below), when a woman is on the Pill or using some other form of hormonal birth control, intercourse usually ends with her man reaching orgasm while inside the vagina, which both the man and woman usually find very pleasurable. For all of these reasons, hormonal methods are very popular, especially with women who are married or in steady relationships who are having sex often.\nHormonal birth control methods have some slight risks for side effects. They may make a very small increase in the risk of blood clots in the lungs, strokes, heart attacks, and breast cancer. Most of these risk are small. Some women may experience mood swings, weight gain, or loss of sex drive. Sometimes, but rarely, these side effects are serious enough to make a woman decide to stop using hormonal birth control.\nIntrauterine methods.\nThis is where an object is put in the woman's uterus (womb, where the fetus grows when she is pregnant). This object is called an \"intrauterine device\" or IUD (acronym).\nThere are two types of IUD: the copper IUD or an IUD with hormones implanted on it. The hormonal IUD has better protection against pregnancy but costs more.\nThe worst part about IUDs is that they have to be put in by a doctor. There is some risk of infection of the uterus after the IUD is put in, but this is only for 1-2 months after.\nCopper IUDs can also be used as a \"day-after\" method to prevent pregnancy after the woman and man already had sex.\nSterilization.\nThis is when a man or woman has surgery to make them not able to make babies.\nMen can get a \"vasectomy\". This is a small surgery where the tube that carries sperm from the testicles is cut.\nWomen can get \"tubal\" surgeries. These are ways that the fallopian tubes are cut or clipped so that eggs cannot go down them to the uterus. (The fallopian tube is the tube that carries the egg from the woman's ovary).\nSterilization is extremely effective, and they allow a man and woman to have intercourse that seems and feels very natural. But sterilization does involve surgery, which can cost more than other types of contraception and can be unpleasant, and unlike other methods it is very hard to reverse if a couple changes their minds and want to have children later.\nOther surgeries will make a woman sterile (not able to get pregnant). These are not done only for contraception, but they are done for other reasons.\nTraditional contraception.\nThese have been used for a very long time. They were used before modern medicine. Some of them were used before scientists even discovered how \"reproduction\" (making babies) happens.\nMany methods can reduce the risk of STDs, but only abstinence is 100% effective.\nPeriodic abstinence.\nThis means a man and a woman practice abstinence (not having sex) when the woman is fertile. When the woman is not fertile, she will not get pregnant when she has sex.\nLactational Amenorrhea Method.\nThis is when a woman is breastfeeding (using her breasts to make milk for her baby). There are certain rules the woman can use to know if she is not fertile. Chances that this method will fail are about 10% (which means 10% chance she can get pregnant)\nInduced abortion.\nInduced abortion (sometimes called just \"abortion\") is when a doctor gives a pregnant woman a medicine or does a surgery to stop the pregnancy. Some people do not call abortion a kind of contraception. This is because contraception means preventing pregnancy, but abortion is stopping a pregnancy that has already started.\nAbortion is not a good birth control method. If a woman does not want to get pregnant, other methods are more safe and inexpensive (cost less money). So many doctors who do abortions for women help women find a better way to not get pregnant the next time.\nReligion and contraception.\nSome religions do not like contraception. Some of them teach that contraception is a sin.\nReligious beliefs that contraception is a sin also keep people from doing \"safe sex\". Some groups who are opposed to this belief say it is dangerous in places where there is a lot of HIV and AIDS, because condoms make people much less likely to get HIV, but at the same times many feel that they can practice extra marital sex since they are \"safe\" from HIV/AIDS.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":100},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnancy","offset":129},{"uri":"Condom","surface_form":"condom","offset":169},{"uri":"Sexually_transmitted_disease","surface_form":"sexually transmitted disease","offset":210},{"uri":"Accident","surface_form":"accident","offset":496},{"uri":"Sexual_intercourse","surface_form":"sexual intercourse","offset":574},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":682},{"uri":"Orgasm","surface_form":"orgasm","offset":928},{"uri":"Ejaculation","surface_form":"ejaculates","offset":1040},{"uri":"Semen","surface_form":"semen","offset":1061},{"uri":"Pregnancy","surface_form":"pregnant","offset":1114},{"uri":"Casual_sex","surface_form":"casual sex","offset":2972},{"uri":"Side_effect","surface_form":"side effect","offset":3351},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Doctors","offset":3788},{"uri":"Hormone","surface_form":"hormonal","offset":3828},{"uri":"Ejaculation","surface_form":"ejaculate","offset":3961},{"uri":"Menstruation","surface_form":"menses","offset":4115},{"uri":"Clot","surface_form":"blood clots","offset":5181},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":5200},{"uri":"Stroke","surface_form":"stroke","offset":5207},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":5216},{"uri":"Breast","surface_form":"breast","offset":5235},{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":5242},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":5544},{"uri":"Fetus","surface_form":"fetus","offset":5568},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":5658},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":5887},{"uri":"Fallopian_tube","surface_form":"fallopian tube","offset":6382},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":6457},{"uri":"Ovary","surface_form":"ovary","offset":6535},{"uri":"Sterile","surface_form":"sterile","offset":6935},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":7150},{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":7190},{"uri":"Breastfeeding","surface_form":"breastfeeding","offset":7586},{"uri":"Fertile","surface_form":"fertile","offset":7711},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":7841},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":7946},{"uri":"Sin","surface_form":"sin","offset":8526},{"uri":"HIV","surface_form":"HIV","offset":8714},{"uri":"AIDS","surface_form":"AIDS","offset":8722},{"uri":"Condom","surface_form":"condom","offset":8736}]}
