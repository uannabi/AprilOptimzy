{"id":85196,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_album","text":"A stamp album is a book, often loose-leafed (with its papers not attached to the book, but hanging loose inside), in which a collection of postage stamps may be stored and displayed. There are also stamp albums in the form of binders.\nMany collectors buy preprinted (already printed) albums and pages, which are made and sold. The usual format is to print a black-and-white picture of the stamp in each space. Album pages are almost always one-sided pages.\nStamp hinges are used by stamp collectors to put postage stamps onto the pages of the stamp album.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":19},{"uri":"Postage_stamp","surface_form":"postage stamp","offset":139},{"uri":"Stamp_collector","surface_form":"stamp collector","offset":482},{"uri":"Postage_stamp","surface_form":"postage stamp","offset":506}]}
