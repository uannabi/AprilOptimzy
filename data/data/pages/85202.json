{"id":85202,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexuality","text":"Pansexual people are people attracted to people regardless of their gender. This is similar to many bisexual people. The word \"pansexual\" comes from the Greek word 'pan-', meaning \"all\".\nPansexuality is one of the many sexualities from the LGBT community. Although the sexuality overlaps with bisexuality, both labels are accepted as long as the person is comfortable and respects the other equally.\nOriginally, Sigmund Freud invented the word \"pansexual\". It meant attraction to all ages and species - pedophilia and zoophilia. The definition has changed since then.\nPansexuality is often described as \u2018attraction to people regardless of gender (including those who may not identify as boys or girls or as men or women, or to those who are intersex, genderfluid, etc.) pansexuality can also be described as \"gender blind\".\nSome may describe it as \"gender blind\" because those who identify as pansexual do not consider gender important when they are attracted to others.\nPansexuality is considered the opposite of asexuality, as pansexuality means a person may be sexually attracted to anyone regardless of their gender identity, but asexuality means a person is sexually attracted to no one. However, pansexuals are not necessarily sexually attracted to everyone they meet, nor do they necessarily have strong sex drives.\nThe pansexual colors from the pride flag all have different meanings, pink meaning women, blue, men, and yellow for people (for an example) of a non-binary gender, such as agender, bigender or genderfluid.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sexual_attraction","surface_form":"attracted","offset":28},{"uri":"Bisexuality","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":100},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Greek","offset":153},{"uri":"LGBT","surface_form":"LGBT","offset":240},{"uri":"Bisexuality","surface_form":"bisexuality","offset":293},{"uri":"Sigmund_Freud","surface_form":"Sigmund Freud","offset":412},{"uri":"Pedophilia","surface_form":"pedophilia","offset":503},{"uri":"Zoophilia","surface_form":"zoophilia","offset":518},{"uri":"Gender","surface_form":"gender","offset":639},{"uri":"Intersex","surface_form":"intersex","offset":741},{"uri":"Asexuality","surface_form":"asexuality","offset":1014},{"uri":"Agender","surface_form":"agender","offset":1495}]}
