{"id":8522,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language","text":"Arabic () is a Semitic language, like Hebrew and Aramaic. Around 292 million people speak it as their first language. Many more people can also understand it as a second language. The Arabic language has its own alphabet written from right to left, like Hebrew. Since it is so widely spoken throughout the world, it is one of the six official languages of the UN, the others being English, French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese.\nMany countries speak Arabic as an official language, but not all of them speak it the same way. The language has many dialects or varieties, such as Modern Standard Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, Gulf Arabic, Maghrebi Arabic, Levantine Arabic and many others. Some of the dialects are so different from one another that speakers have a hard time understanding the other.\nMost of the countries that use Arabic as their official language are in the Middle East. They are part of the Arab World because the largest religion in the region is Islam.\nThe language is very important in Islam because Muslims believe that Allah (God) used it to talk to Muhammad through the Archangel Gabriel (Jibril), giving him the Quran in Arabic. Many but not all Arabic-speakers are Muslims.\nArabic is also becoming a popular language to learn in the Western world even though its grammar is sometimes very hard to learn for native speakers of Indo-European languages. Many other languages have borrowed words from Arabic, because of its importance in history. Some English words that can be traced to Arabic are sugar, cotton, magazine, algebra, alcohol and emir.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Semitic_languages","surface_form":"Semitic language","offset":15},{"uri":"Hebrew_language","surface_form":"Hebrew","offset":38},{"uri":"Aramaic","surface_form":"Aramaic","offset":49},{"uri":"First_language","surface_form":"first language","offset":102},{"uri":"Second_language","surface_form":"second language","offset":163},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"UN","offset":360},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":381},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":390},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":398},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":407},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":419},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":546},{"uri":"Modern_Standard_Arabic","surface_form":"Modern Standard Arabic","offset":577},{"uri":"Egyptian_Arabic","surface_form":"Egyptian Arabic","offset":601},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":869},{"uri":"Arab_World","surface_form":"Arab World","offset":903},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":960},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Muslims","offset":1015},{"uri":"Allah","surface_form":"Allah","offset":1036},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":1043},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":1067},{"uri":"Angel","surface_form":"Archangel","offset":1088},{"uri":"Gabriel","surface_form":"Gabriel","offset":1098},{"uri":"Quran","surface_form":"Quran","offset":1131},{"uri":"Western_world","surface_form":"Western world","offset":1253},{"uri":"Grammar","surface_form":"grammar","offset":1283},{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European languages","offset":1346},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":1454},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1468},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":1515},{"uri":"Cotton","surface_form":"cotton","offset":1522},{"uri":"Magazine","surface_form":"magazine","offset":1530},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":1540},{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":1549},{"uri":"Emir","surface_form":"emir","offset":1561}]}
