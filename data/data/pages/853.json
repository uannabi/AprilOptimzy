{"id":853,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft","text":"Theft is when one person or group takes from another persons or state any object, money, or information without permission. A person who has been convicted of theft may be called a thief. However, the practice of engaging in theft is also called stealing. There are many different types of theft, such as pickpocketing and shoplifting. Burglary and robbery are separate crimes which involve theft.\nStealing is basic and is illegal almost everywhere. Thieves steal things sometimes because they want to have something for themselves, or because they want to sell something for money. Sometimes thieves will make plans to rob a store, bank, house, or person, and sometimes they will just see a chance to steal something and take it. Some thieves have kleptomania.\nWhen thieves steal things for money, they usually pick cars, electronics, laptops, or other things they can sell easily. Sometimes thieves use pawn shops to sell things easily to someone who will not ask questions.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Person","surface_form":"person","offset":53},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"s","offset":59},{"uri":"State","surface_form":"state","offset":64},{"uri":"Object","surface_form":"object","offset":74},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":82},{"uri":"Information","surface_form":"information","offset":92},{"uri":"Pickpocketing","surface_form":"pickpocketing","offset":305},{"uri":"Shoplifting","surface_form":"shoplifting","offset":323},{"uri":"Burglary","surface_form":"Burglary","offset":336},{"uri":"Robbery","surface_form":"robbery","offset":349},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":576},{"uri":"Kleptomania","surface_form":"kleptomania","offset":749},{"uri":"Car","surface_form":"car","offset":817},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronics","offset":823},{"uri":"Laptop","surface_form":"laptop","offset":836},{"uri":"Pawn_shop","surface_form":"pawn shop","offset":905}]}
