{"id":85451,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_fish","text":"An electric fish is a fish that can make electric fields. Many fish (sharks, rays, and catfish) can detect electric fields: they are 'electroreceptive'. They cannot make electric fields, and are not called electric fish.\nStrongly and weakly electric fish.\nElectric fish have a special organ that makes electricity. This organ is called an electric organ. It is usually near the tail of the fish. It is made from specialised muscle or nerve cells. When the organ releases electricity this is called an \"electric organ discharge\" (or \"EOD\" for short).\nIn total, there are 348 known species of electric fish, in about 56 genera. The only known species that lives in salt water are the electric rays, with 23 species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":22},{"uri":"Electric_field","surface_form":"electric field","offset":41},{"uri":"Shark","surface_form":"shark","offset":69},{"uri":"Ray","surface_form":"ray","offset":77},{"uri":"Catfish","surface_form":"catfish","offset":87},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":580},{"uri":"Genera","surface_form":"genera","offset":618},{"uri":"Electric_ray","surface_form":"electric ray","offset":682}]}
