{"id":85466,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourgen_Yanikian","text":"Kourken Megerdich Yanigian (, December 24, 1895, Erzurum, Ottoman Armenia - March 27, 1984, USA) was an Armenian terrorist who killed two Turkish consular officials in California in 1973. His stated purpose was \"to demand justice\" for the Armenian Genocide.\nArmenians hoped Yanigian's trial would provide a vehicle for proving the massacres in a court of law, while there were still surviving witnesses. Yanigian took the Armenian Genocide witness stand, accompanied by his friend and interpreter, Santa Barbaran Aram Saroyan, the uncle of famous author William Saroyan. Yanigian told of his 26 family members killed in the massacres, and how he watched in hiding as marauding Turks slit his brother's throat. Finally, he said that he killed the Turkish\ndiplomats as representatives of the \"government that had massacred his people\".\nHe was sentenced to life in prison in July 1973 and paroled in 1984, over the objection of the Turkish government.\nAfter Yanigian's death, District Attorney David D. Minner wrote: \"Looking back, I regret that I did not allow the genocide to\nbe proven. Not because Yanigian should have gone free, but because\nhistory's darkest chapters - its genocides - should be exposed, so\ntheir horrors are less likely to be repeated\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Erzurum","surface_form":"Erzurum","offset":49},{"uri":"Ottoman_Armenia","surface_form":"Ottoman Armenia","offset":58},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"USA","offset":92},{"uri":"Armenian_people","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":104},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":113},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":138},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":168},{"uri":"Armenian_Genocide","surface_form":"Armenian Genocide","offset":239},{"uri":"Armenian_Genocide","surface_form":"Armenian Genocide","offset":422},{"uri":"Santa_Barbara","surface_form":"Santa Barbara","offset":498},{"uri":"William_Saroyan","surface_form":"William Saroyan","offset":554},{"uri":"Turkish_government","surface_form":"Turkish government","offset":929}]}
