{"id":8554,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_aid","text":"=\"preserve\">Foreign aid is when one country helps another country. The country may give money or things; it may also send people. This is especially needed when a disaster happens in a poor country. Sometimes this help comes from a country's government and sometimes the ordinary people give money. Some foreign aid helps by giving food and clean water to people who need them. Most of the time it is a charity which donates to the poor countries. Some aid is for Economic development.\nThe poor countries are called LEDC's (Less Economically Developed Countries). The richer countries are called MEDC's (More Economically Developed Countries).\nUnited Nations and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development also work for such aid for poor countries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":36},{"uri":"Disaster","surface_form":"disaster","offset":163},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":242},{"uri":"Charitable_organization","surface_form":"charity","offset":403},{"uri":"Developing_country","surface_form":"poor countries","offset":432},{"uri":"Economic_development","surface_form":"Economic development","offset":464},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":644},{"uri":"Organization_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development","surface_form":"Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development","offset":663}]}
