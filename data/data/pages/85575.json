{"id":85575,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9lodie","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"M\u00E9lodie\" is the French word for \u201Cmelody\u201D. The word is used in music to mean songs written by French composers of classical music from the mid-19th century to the present. The \"m\u00E9lodie\" in French music is similar to the \"Lied\" in German music. \"M\u00E9lodie\" is not the same as \"chanson\" (the French word for \u201Csong\u201D). The word \"chanson\" is used for folksongs or popular songs.\nHistory.\nIn Germany composers of classical music had been writing great songs from about 1800, but in France the \"m\u00E9lodie\" became important about 50 years later. While some German \"Lieder\" were based on folksong, the texts of the \"m\u00E9lodie\"s were usually poems by serious poets.\nHector Berlioz was the first composer to call some of his compositions \"m\u00E9lodie\"s. His \"Les Nuits d'\u00C9t\u00E9\" (1841) is one of the greatest of all song cycles. Charles Gounod wrote about 200 \"m\u00E9lodie\"s. He used texts by famous poets such as Hugo.\nGabriel Faur\u00E9 wrote more than 100 \"m\u00E9lodie\"s, many based on poems by Verlaine.\nHenri Duparc wrote seventeen \"m\u00E9lodie\"s. These are what he is known for.\nClaude Debussy and Maurice Ravel were very famous composers who wrote a lot of music, including \"m\u00E9lodie\"s that are often sung today. Ravel\u2019s melodies are unusual because they are often based on folksong. Other composers of \"m\u00E9lodie\" at the time include Albert Roussel, Reynaldo Hahn and Andr\u00E9 Caplet.\n\"M\u00E9lodie\"s continue to be composed today, though perhaps the last really popular composer of them was Francis Poulenc, who died in 1963.\nPerforming \"m\u00E9lodie\"s.\nIn the French \"m\u00E9lodie\" the poet\u2019s feelings are often suggested or hinted at rather than stated in an obvious way. There is a very close relationship between the text (words) and the melody. To sing \"m\u00E9lodie\" really well a singer must know the French language very well and understand a lot about French poetry. The rules about singing in the French language can be quite complicated. It is important to know when to let the last sound of a word run into the next word (elision). Several books have been written about this.\nAlthough many famous singers are well known for singing French \"m\u00E9lodie\", the most famous singer from the past was Pierre Bernac. He gave many song recitals with the composer Francis Poulenc who accompanied him on the piano. He wrote a book on how to sing \"m\u00E9lodie\"s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":30},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"melody","offset":47},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":107},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":114},{"uri":"Classical_music","surface_form":"classical music","offset":127},{"uri":"19th_century","surface_form":"19th century","offset":156},{"uri":"Lied","surface_form":"Lied","offset":234},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":243},{"uri":"Chanson","surface_form":"chanson","offset":287},{"uri":"Folksong","surface_form":"folksong","offset":357},{"uri":"Popular_song","surface_form":"popular song","offset":370},{"uri":"Folksong","surface_form":"folksong","offset":588},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":656},{"uri":"Hector_Berlioz","surface_form":"Hector Berlioz","offset":663},{"uri":"Song_cycle","surface_form":"song cycle","offset":805},{"uri":"Charles_Gounod","surface_form":"Charles Gounod","offset":818},{"uri":"Victor_Hugo","surface_form":"Hugo","offset":899},{"uri":"Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9","surface_form":"Gabriel Faur\u00E9","offset":905},{"uri":"Paul_Verlaine","surface_form":"Verlaine","offset":974},{"uri":"Henri_Duparc","surface_form":"Henri Duparc","offset":984},{"uri":"Claude_Debussy","surface_form":"Claude Debussy","offset":1057},{"uri":"Maurice_Ravel","surface_form":"Maurice Ravel","offset":1076},{"uri":"Albert_Roussel","surface_form":"Albert Roussel","offset":1311},{"uri":"Reynaldo_Hahn","surface_form":"Reynaldo Hahn","offset":1327},{"uri":"Andr%C3%A9_Caplet","surface_form":"Andr\u00E9 Caplet","offset":1345},{"uri":"Francis_Poulenc","surface_form":"Francis Poulenc","offset":1461},{"uri":"Elision","surface_form":"elision","offset":1989},{"uri":"Pierre_Bernac","surface_form":"Pierre Bernac","offset":2158},{"uri":"Recital","surface_form":"recital","offset":2191},{"uri":"Francis_Poulenc","surface_form":"Francis Poulenc","offset":2218}]}
