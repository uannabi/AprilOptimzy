{"id":85613,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Sounds","text":"The Nashville Sounds are a minor league baseball team from Nashville, Tennessee. They play at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the Pacific Coast League (a group of 16\u00A0baseball teams at the same level). The Sounds are partnered with the Texas Rangers, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Rangers.\nThe team is named \"Sounds\" because Nashville, the city where the team plays, is famous for making country music.\nThe Sounds played at a stadium called Herschel Greer Stadium from 1978 to 2014. In 2015, the Sounds began to play at a new stadium called First Horizon Park.\nHistory.\nThe Sounds started playing baseball in 1978 in the Southern League, which is at the Double-A (AA) level, two levels before Major League Baseball. They were partnered with the Cincinnati Reds (1978\u20131979) and New York Yankees (1980\u20131984). The Sounds won the championship of the Southern League in 1979 and 1982.\nIn 1985, the Sounds began to play at the Triple-A level in a league called the American Association. While playing in this league, they were partnered with the Detroit Tigers (1985\u20131986), Cincinnati Reds (1987\u20131992), and Chicago White Sox (1993\u20131997).\nThe American Association ended after the 1997 season, so the Sounds started playing in the Pacific Coast League in 1998. In the past, they were partners with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1998\u20132004), Milwaukee Brewers (2005\u20132014), and Oakland Athletics (2015\u20132019). They began their partnership with the Texas Rangers in 2019. The Sounds won the championship of the Pacific Coast League in 2005.\nBallparks.\nThe Sounds' first ballpark was Herschel Greer Stadium. They played baseball games there from 1978 to 2014. There were many changes to the ballpark after it was completed in 1978. It had seats for 10,300\u00A0spectators. Its best known feature was its giant 115.6\u00A0foot (35.2\u00A0m) scoreboard which was behind the left field wall and shaped like a guitar. After the construction of new and luxurious minor league ballparks in the 1990s, Greer had fallen below standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball. Therefore, there were several repairs and upgrades made to meet Triple-A standards until a new stadium could be built. Greer Stadium was demolished in 2019.\nIn 2014, the Sounds and the city of Nashville agreed on a plan to build a new baseball stadium for the team. The Sounds began playing baseball at the new stadium, called First Horizon Park, in 2015. It has space for 10,000\u00A0spectators. There are 8,500 seats, and there is a spot of grass where 1,500 others can sit. It also has a guitar-shaped scoreboard.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_league_baseball","surface_form":"minor league","offset":27},{"uri":"Baseball","surface_form":"baseball","offset":40},{"uri":"Nashville%2C_Tennessee","surface_form":"Nashville","offset":59},{"uri":"Tennessee","surface_form":"Tennessee","offset":70},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":152},{"uri":"Pacific_Coast_League","surface_form":"Pacific Coast League","offset":211},{"uri":"Texas_Rangers_(baseball)","surface_form":"Texas Rangers","offset":316},{"uri":"Country_music","surface_form":"country music","offset":557},{"uri":"Stadium","surface_form":"stadium","offset":595},{"uri":"Herschel_Greer_Stadium","surface_form":"Herschel Greer Stadium","offset":610},{"uri":"First_Horizon_Park","surface_form":"First Horizon Park","offset":710},{"uri":"Southern_League_(baseball)","surface_form":"Southern League","offset":790},{"uri":"Major_League_Baseball","surface_form":"Major League Baseball","offset":862},{"uri":"Cincinnati_Reds","surface_form":"Cincinnati Reds","offset":914},{"uri":"New_York_Yankees","surface_form":"New York Yankees","offset":946},{"uri":"Championship","surface_form":"championship","offset":995},{"uri":"American_Association_(20th_century)","surface_form":"American Association","offset":1128},{"uri":"Detroit_Tigers","surface_form":"Detroit Tigers","offset":1209},{"uri":"Cincinnati_Reds","surface_form":"Cincinnati Reds","offset":1237},{"uri":"Chicago_White_Sox","surface_form":"Chicago White Sox","offset":1270},{"uri":"Pacific_Coast_League","surface_form":"Pacific Coast League","offset":1392},{"uri":"Pittsburgh_Pirates","surface_form":"Pittsburgh Pirates","offset":1463},{"uri":"Milwaukee_Brewers","surface_form":"Milwaukee Brewers","offset":1495},{"uri":"Oakland_Athletics","surface_form":"Oakland Athletics","offset":1530},{"uri":"Texas_Rangers_(baseball)","surface_form":"Texas Rangers","offset":1599},{"uri":"Ballpark","surface_form":"ballpark","offset":1720},{"uri":"Herschel_Greer_Stadium","surface_form":"Herschel Greer Stadium","offset":1733},{"uri":"Scoreboard","surface_form":"scoreboard","offset":1974},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":2040},{"uri":"First_Horizon_Park","surface_form":"First Horizon Park","offset":2541}]}
