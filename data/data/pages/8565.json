{"id":8565,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station","text":"A few power stations use the sun's rays to generate solar power without motion. There are many power stations around the world, because many things need electricity to work.\nStations may be operated as Load following power plant, peaking power plant, or base load power plant.\nNon-renewable energy resources.\nThese all use heat as a source of energy.\nSolid-state electricity sources.\nThese sources have no moving parts. They are more expensive than generators, and are used where other questions are more important.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Load_following_power_plant","surface_form":"Load following power plant","offset":202},{"uri":"Peaking_power_plant","surface_form":"peaking power plant","offset":230},{"uri":"Base_load_power_plant","surface_form":"base load power plant","offset":254}]}
