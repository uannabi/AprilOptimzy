{"id":8570,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality","text":"e=\"preserve\">Reality means anything that exists. An event that has actually happened, or a thing which really exists is said to have \"reality.\" Something close to reality is \"realistic\".\nReality is the state of things as they are, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined. In a wider definition, reality includes everything that is and has been, whether or not we can see it and understand it. An even wider definition includes everything that has existed, exists, or will exist.\nReality is often contrasted with what is imaginary, delusional, in the mind, dreams, what is false, what is fictional, or what is abstract.\nAll the same, what is abstract plays a role in everyday life and in academic research. For instance, causality, virtue, life and justice are abstract concepts. They are difficult to define, but they are not pure delusions.\nTelevision programs that are not scripted are called Reality TV.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Existence","surface_form":"exists","offset":41},{"uri":"Event","surface_form":"event","offset":52},{"uri":"Being","surface_form":"been","offset":351},{"uri":"Imagination","surface_form":"imaginary","offset":532},{"uri":"Delusion","surface_form":"delusion","offset":543},{"uri":"Mind","surface_form":"mind","offset":562},{"uri":"Dream","surface_form":"dream","offset":568},{"uri":"Lie","surface_form":"false","offset":584},{"uri":"Fictional","surface_form":"fictional","offset":599},{"uri":"Abstraction","surface_form":"abstract","offset":621},{"uri":"Academia","surface_form":"academic","offset":699},{"uri":"Causality","surface_form":"causality","offset":732},{"uri":"Virtue","surface_form":"virtue","offset":743},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"life","offset":751},{"uri":"Justice","surface_form":"justice","offset":760},{"uri":"Concepts","surface_form":"concepts","offset":781},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"Television programs","offset":854},{"uri":"Screenplay","surface_form":"scripted","offset":887},{"uri":"Reality_television","surface_form":"Reality TV","offset":907}]}
