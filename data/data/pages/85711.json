{"id":85711,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish","text":"Catfish are an order of teleost fish, the Siluriformes. There are about 40 families in the order.\nThey are called catfish because their barbels look like the whiskers of a cat. They are very diverse. The heaviest is the Mekong giant catfish, up to 350\u00A0kg (770\u00A0lb). The longest is the wels catfish, up to 4\u00A0m (13\u00A0ft). There are also detrivores in the group. There are some tiny parasitic catfish called candiru. Some catfish are grown for food, in fish farms. Some catfish can be kept in aquaria.\nSpecial lifestyles.\nMost catfish do not harm people, but some of them can cause problems. It is said that the candiru can enter the human urethra, where they stay as parasites. In normal life they are parasites on fish gills.\nThe Malapteruridae are a family of electric catfish. Several species of the family can produce an electric shock of up to 350 volts using electroplaques of an electric organ.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Order_(biology)","surface_form":"order","offset":15},{"uri":"Teleost","surface_form":"teleost","offset":24},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":32},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"families","offset":75},{"uri":"Barbel","surface_form":"barbel","offset":136},{"uri":"Whisker","surface_form":"whisker","offset":158},{"uri":"Cat","surface_form":"cat","offset":172},{"uri":"Mekong_giant_catfish","surface_form":"Mekong giant catfish","offset":220},{"uri":"Wels_catfish","surface_form":"wels catfish","offset":284},{"uri":"Detrivore","surface_form":"detrivore","offset":332},{"uri":"Parasite","surface_form":"parasitic","offset":377},{"uri":"Candiru","surface_form":"candiru","offset":402},{"uri":"Fish_farm","surface_form":"fish farm","offset":447},{"uri":"Aquarium","surface_form":"aquaria","offset":487},{"uri":"Urethra","surface_form":"urethra","offset":634},{"uri":"Parasites","surface_form":"parasites","offset":662},{"uri":"Gill","surface_form":"gill","offset":715},{"uri":"Electric_fish","surface_form":"electric catfish","offset":757},{"uri":"Electric_shock","surface_form":"electric shock","offset":820},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"volt","offset":848},{"uri":"Electric_organ","surface_form":"electric organ","offset":881}]}
