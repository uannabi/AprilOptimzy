{"id":85736,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allemande","text":"An allemande () is a dance that was popular in Baroque music of the 17th and early 18th centuries. The word comes from the French word for \"German\".\nComposers of the Baroque period often wrote a group of dances called a suite. There was usually an allemande, a courante, a sarabande and a gigue, in that order. Sometimes there were one or two other dances as well. Sometimes a suite started with a prelude (an introductory movement) before the allemande.\nThe allemande was played at a moderate speed - not very fast, nor very slow. There were usually 4 beats in a bar (4/4 time) but also sometimes in 2/2 time, and it started with an anacrusis (an upbeat, i.e. one, or possibly a small group of notes which were not on the first beat of a bar).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":21},{"uri":"Baroque_music","surface_form":"Baroque music","offset":47},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th","offset":68},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th centuries","offset":83},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":123},{"uri":"Suite_(music)","surface_form":"suite","offset":220},{"uri":"Courante","surface_form":"courante","offset":261},{"uri":"Sarabande","surface_form":"sarabande","offset":273},{"uri":"Gigue","surface_form":"gigue","offset":289},{"uri":"Prelude","surface_form":"prelude","offset":398},{"uri":"Movement_(music)","surface_form":"movement","offset":423},{"uri":"Bar_(music)","surface_form":"bar","offset":564},{"uri":"Anacrusis","surface_form":"anacrusis","offset":634}]}
