{"id":8574,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum","text":"Sigma notation.\nSigma notation is a mathematical notation to write long sums in a short way. Sigma notation uses the Greek letter Sigma (formula_1), and takes upper and lower bounds which tell us where the sum begins and where it ends. The lower bound usually has a variable (called the index, often denoted by formula_1, formula_1 or formula_1) along with a value, such as \"formula_1\". This tells us that the summation begins at 2, and goes up by 1 until it reaches the number on the top.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sigma","surface_form":"Sigma","offset":130}]}
