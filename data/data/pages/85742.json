{"id":85742,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courante","text":"e=\"preserve\">A courante () is a dance that was popular in Baroque music in the 17th and early 18th centuries. The word comes from the French word for to \"run\".\nThe courante was a fast, running dance with 3 beats in a bar (the time signature was often 3/2, although sometimes it was 3/4). During the 17th century the French courante started to become slower than the Italian corrente, and it often had more counterpoint (imitating parts). However, this was not a strict rule, and the courantes that Bach wrote were both Italian and French in style, and sometimes he called them \"courante\" and sometimes \"corrente\".\nComposers of the Baroque period often composed a group of several dances. This was called a suite. There was usually an allemande, then the courante was the second dance, followed by a sarabande and a gigue and sometimes one or two other dances or as well.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dance","surface_form":"dance","offset":32},{"uri":"Baroque_music","surface_form":"Baroque music","offset":58},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th","offset":79},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th centuries","offset":94},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":134},{"uri":"Bar_(music)","surface_form":"bar","offset":217},{"uri":"Time_signature","surface_form":"time signature","offset":226},{"uri":"17th_century","surface_form":"17th century","offset":299},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":366},{"uri":"Counterpoint","surface_form":"counterpoint","offset":406},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Bach","offset":498},{"uri":"Suite_(music)","surface_form":"suite","offset":706},{"uri":"Allemande","surface_form":"allemande","offset":734},{"uri":"Sarabande","surface_form":"sarabande","offset":799},{"uri":"Gigue","surface_form":"gigue","offset":815}]}
