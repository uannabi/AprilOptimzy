{"id":8580,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim","text":"For living creatures, a swim or swimming is a way of moving in water. Swimming is an activity that can be both useful and recreational. Its primary uses are bathing, cooling, fishing, recreation, exercise, and sport.\nHuman swimming.\nSwimming has been known amongst humans since prehistoric times; the earliest record of swimming dates back to Stone Age, from around 7,000 years ago. Competitive swimming started in Europe around 1800 and was part of the first modern 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, though not in a form comparable to the contemporary events. It was not until 1908 that regulations were implemented by the International Swimming Federation to produce competitive swimming.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Creature","surface_form":"creature","offset":11},{"uri":"Water","surface_form":"water","offset":63},{"uri":"Bathing","surface_form":"bathing","offset":157},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":175},{"uri":"Recreation","surface_form":"recreation","offset":184},{"uri":"Exercise","surface_form":"exercise","offset":196},{"uri":"Sport","surface_form":"sport","offset":210},{"uri":"Stone_Age","surface_form":"Stone Age","offset":343},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":415},{"uri":"1896_Summer_Olympics","surface_form":"1896 Summer Olympics","offset":467},{"uri":"Athens","surface_form":"Athens","offset":491},{"uri":"Comparable","surface_form":"comparable","offset":520}]}
