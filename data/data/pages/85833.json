{"id":85833,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung","text":"The Sturmabteilung (; often shortened to SA) was a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party. Their leader was Ernst R\u00F6hm. The group was important in helping Adolf Hitler gain power in the 1930s.\nIn English, they are often called the Stormtroopers or the Brownshirts, while \"Sturmabteilung\" literally translates to \" detachment\" or \"assault section\". They wore a brown uniform, similar to the black uniform worn by Mussolini's Blackshirts.\nThe word \"Sturmabteilung\" was used before the founding of the Nazi Party in 1919. It originally comes from the specialized assault troops used by Germany in World War I using \"Hutier\" infiltration tactics.\nThe SA played a key role in Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s. In 1934, however, he abolished the organization and sent the Schutzstaffel to arrest and kill their leaders.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paramilitary","surface_form":"paramilitary","offset":51},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":78},{"uri":"Nazi_Party","surface_form":"Nazi Party","offset":85},{"uri":"Ernst_R%C3%B6hm","surface_form":"Ernst R\u00F6hm","offset":114},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":161},{"uri":"Mussolini","surface_form":"Mussolini's","offset":418},{"uri":"Blackshirts","surface_form":"Blackshirts","offset":430},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":600},{"uri":"Oskar_von_Hutier","surface_form":"Hutier","offset":619},{"uri":"Infiltration_tactics","surface_form":"infiltration tactics","offset":627},{"uri":"Adolf_Hitler","surface_form":"Adolf Hitler","offset":677},{"uri":"Schutzstaffel","surface_form":"Schutzstaffel","offset":781}]}
