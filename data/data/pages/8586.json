{"id":8586,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)","text":"Monopoly is a board game played by two to eight players. In the game, players move around the spaces of the board, buying and selling land and buildings to try to become the richest player.\nMany books give advice on how to win the game. An early book, \"1000 Ways to Win Monopoly Games\" was written by Jeffrey S. Lehman (who later became President of Cornell University) and Jay S. Walker (founder of priceline.com.)\nHistory.\n\"Monopoly\" was created by Elizabeth Magie as a teaching tool based on the economic concept of land monopoly. Magie created the game in 1903, to explain the single tax theory of Henry George. She wanted her game to be an educational tool to highlight the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. Her game, which she called \"The Landlord's Game\", was self-published, beginning in 1906. The original rules included several ways to play the game, including one where players could agree to share the land rents and everyone would win.\nIn 1934, Charles Darrow in Philadelphia found The Landlord's Game and thought that the game was more exciting when players didn't share their land rents. He published his own version of the game where making money was the focus of the game, and called it \"Monopoly.\" Later on, he sold his game to Parker Brothers, who falsely credited Charles Darrow as the creator of the game.\nThe Board.\nOn the Monopoly board are 40 spaces. In the four corners of the board are \"GO\", \"Free Parking\", \"JAIL\", and \"Go to Jail\". Along the sides of the board are properties (streets and businesses) for sale. The properties are: 22 \"streets\" (each marked with one of eight colors), 4 \"railroad stations\", the \"Electric Company\" and the \"Water Works\". There are also spaces called \"Income Tax\", \"Luxury Tax\", \"Community Chest\" and \"Chance\".\nIn the original version, the properties and railroad stations were named after the streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States. In the British original version, they are named after streets in London.\nSetting up the Game.\nTo prepare for the game, the board is put in position. The Chance and Community Chest cards are shuffled and placed face down on the board. Each player chooses a token (a playing piece), such as a thimble, a rocking horse, a boot, a dog, etc. (the tokens vary depending on the edition), and places it on \"GO\". One player is chosen to be the banker - this player is trusted with handing out money from the bank and collecting players' spent money during the game.\nThe banker gives each player $1500 to start with. Each player rolls the dice, and the player who rolled the highest sum takes the first turn.\nRules.\nThe object of the game is to own as much land (property) and to be the richest player.\nThe rules can be found in every \"Monopoly\" box, but a summary is listed here.\nMoving Around The Board.\nOn your turn, you roll the dice and move your token forward (clockwise around the edge of the board) the same number of spaces as the sum of the dice you rolled. You must then follow the instructions of whatever space your token lands on.\nIf you roll doubles (the same number on both dice), you get to take another turn after this one is over. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you don't get your third turn but you must go directly to Jail (see below).\nJail.\nIf you are put into Jail, take your token from wherever it is and place it directly on IN JAIL. This does not count as a move, so if this causes you to go past GO, you don't collect $200 from the Bank. If you are put in Jail, your turn ends immediately, even if you rolled doubles and would get to take another turn.\nNote that being in Jail doesn't prevent you from doing anything else in the game - it just stops your token from moving around the board.\nDifferent editions.\nThere are many editions of Monopoly. Officially-licensed editions are produced by Hasbro itself or by USAopoly, and unofficial editions are published by Toy Vault. Official versions are named \"____ Monopoly\" (such as \"Star Wars Monopoly\") and feature the Monopoly logo, and unofficial versions are named \"____-Opoly\" (such as \"Python-Opoly\") and do not feature the Monopoly logo.\nMilton Bradley has produced editions to symbolize the decades of popular culture in America. For example, The 1970's Monopoly has spaces depicting the fashion of the time. Players can purchase bell bottom blue jeans instead of street properties.\nA number of video game adaptations have been made. In addition, many electronic editions exist that use credit cards instead of paper money.\nIn India, a similar game is called Business.\nIn Egypt, a similar game is called \u0628\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062D\u0638 (The Bank of Luck).\nAcquire is another game with rules for more advanced business practices with stocks, but has similar basic concepts of Monopoly (owning properties of the same color, buying land and building on it, making the most money, etc.).\nUses for Monopoly.\nPeople play Monopoly for different reasons. Some may play for family game night, others use it as a learning tool at school, and others play it just to have fun.\nMonopoly may be used as a teaching tool to teach children a variety of lessons while having fun. It teaches how to make deals when trading, playing fair (because cheaters never win), knowing the value of money, addition and subtraction, good sportsmanship, the thrill of competition, strategies and organization. At an elementary level, \u201Cit offers a marvelous vehicle for teaching mathematics\u201D. Through the game, children explore different areas of mathematics: not only adding and subtracting but also probability, percentages, and patterns. At a higher level, teachers can use Monopoly to teach microeconomics principles.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Board_game","surface_form":"board game","offset":14},{"uri":"Cornell_University","surface_form":"Cornell University","offset":350},{"uri":"Elizabeth_Magie","surface_form":"Elizabeth Magie","offset":451},{"uri":"Economic","surface_form":"economic","offset":499},{"uri":"Monopoly","surface_form":"monopoly","offset":524},{"uri":"Single_tax","surface_form":"single tax","offset":581},{"uri":"Henry_George","surface_form":"Henry George","offset":602},{"uri":"Charles_Darrow","surface_form":"Charles Darrow","offset":986},{"uri":"Parker_Brothers","surface_form":"Parker Brothers","offset":1274},{"uri":"Jail","surface_form":"Jail","offset":1481},{"uri":"Street","surface_form":"street","offset":1881},{"uri":"New_Jersey","surface_form":"New Jersey","offset":1909},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1927},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":1949},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":2007},{"uri":"Banker","surface_form":"banker","offset":2377},{"uri":"Bank","surface_form":"bank","offset":2441},{"uri":"Clockwise","surface_form":"clockwise","offset":2899},{"uri":"Star_Wars","surface_form":"Star Wars","offset":4008},{"uri":"Monty_Python","surface_form":"Python","offset":4117},{"uri":"Credit_card","surface_form":"credit card","offset":4520},{"uri":"Acquire","surface_form":"Acquire","offset":4666},{"uri":"Sportsmanship","surface_form":"sportsmanship","offset":5317},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":5456},{"uri":"Microeconomics","surface_form":"microeconomics","offset":5672}]}
