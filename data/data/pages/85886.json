{"id":85886,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory","text":"e=\"preserve\">Static random-access memory (SRAM) is a type of RAM that keeps data that is fed to it without having to be refreshed over and over again.\nBoth DRAM and SRAM store information in binary by using very small electronic components. Both are volatile (need electric current flowing to keep the negative and positive charged components stay that way).\nOne difference is that SRAM are also used for specific applications within the PC, where their good points outweigh their bad points compared to DRAM.\nLike other semiconductor chips, SRAM chips are made by photolithography.\nFor SRAM, each bit is composed of between four and six transistors, forming a flip-flop to hold information. This complexity is what makes SRAM bigger and more expensive than DRAM. In DRAM each bit has only one transistor plus a capacitor acting like a miniature rechargeable battery).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"RAM","surface_form":"RAM","offset":61},{"uri":"Data","surface_form":"data","offset":76},{"uri":"DRAM","surface_form":"DRAM","offset":156},{"uri":"Binary","surface_form":"binary","offset":191},{"uri":"Electronic_component","surface_form":"electronic component","offset":218},{"uri":"Non-volatile_random-access_memory","surface_form":"volatile","offset":250},{"uri":"Electric_current","surface_form":"electric current","offset":265},{"uri":"Electric_charge","surface_form":"charged","offset":324},{"uri":"Personal_computer","surface_form":"PC","offset":438},{"uri":"DRAM","surface_form":"DRAM","offset":504},{"uri":"Semiconductor","surface_form":"semiconductor","offset":521},{"uri":"Photolithography","surface_form":"photolithography","offset":565},{"uri":"Transistor","surface_form":"transistor","offset":638},{"uri":"Flip-flop_(electronics)","surface_form":"flip-flop","offset":661},{"uri":"DRAM","surface_form":"DRAM","offset":758},{"uri":"DRAM","surface_form":"DRAM","offset":767},{"uri":"Capacitor","surface_form":"capacitor","offset":812},{"uri":"Rechargeable_battery","surface_form":"rechargeable battery","offset":846}]}
