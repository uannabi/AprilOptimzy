{"id":85954,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East","text":"e=\"preserve\">The term Far East means countries of East Asia. It became used in the English language during the period of the British Empire for lands to the east of British India.\nBefore World War I, the \"Near East\" meant relatively nearby lands of the Ottoman Empire, \"Middle East\" northwestern South Asia and Central Asia, and \"Far East\" countries along the western Pacific Ocean and countries along the eastern Indian Ocean. Many European languages have analogous terms, such as the French ', Spanish ', Portuguese ', German ', Italian ', and Dutch '.\n\"Far East\" is never used for the culturally Western nations of Australia and New Zealand, which lie even farther to the east of Europe than much of East Asia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"East_Asia","surface_form":"East Asia","offset":50},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English language","offset":83},{"uri":"British_Empire","surface_form":"British Empire","offset":125},{"uri":"British_Raj","surface_form":"British India","offset":165},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":187},{"uri":"Near_East","surface_form":"Near East","offset":205},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":253},{"uri":"Middle_East","surface_form":"Middle East","offset":270},{"uri":"South_Asia","surface_form":"South Asia","offset":296},{"uri":"Central_Asia","surface_form":"Central Asia","offset":311},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":486},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":496},{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":507},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":521},{"uri":"Italian_language","surface_form":"Italian","offset":531},{"uri":"Dutch_language","surface_form":"Dutch","offset":546},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":618},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":632}]}
