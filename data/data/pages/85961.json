{"id":85961,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corippo","text":"Corippo is a former municipality of the district Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.\nWith a population of just 17 as of December 2004, it is the smallest municipality in Switzerland. It has many of the things that communities many times its size has: an official website ([http://www.corippo.ch www.corippo.ch]), its own coat of arms, a village church, a restaurant, and a mayor who leads a town council made up of three local citizens. The village has remained independent since 1822.\nOn 17 October 2020 the former municipalities of Brione (Verzasca), Corippo, Frasco, Sonogno and Vogorno merged to form the new municipality of Verzasca.\nDescription.\nCorippo lies in the Verzasca valley about 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) from Locarno at the north end of the reservoir Lake Vogorno, and 20\u00A0km from the border with Italy. The houses are built from the local Ticino granite with slate roofs and have changed little for several hundred years, leading the Italian writer Piero Bianconi to describe Corippo as \"Verzasca's gentlest village\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipality","offset":20},{"uri":"Locarno_(district)","surface_form":"Locarno","offset":49},{"uri":"Cantons_of_Switzerland","surface_form":"canton","offset":64},{"uri":"Ticino","surface_form":"Ticino","offset":74},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":84},{"uri":"As_of_2004","surface_form":"as of December 2004","offset":126},{"uri":"Coat_of_arms","surface_form":"coat of arms","offset":333},{"uri":"Church","surface_form":"church","offset":357},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":367},{"uri":"Mayor","surface_form":"mayor","offset":385},{"uri":"Brione_(Verzasca)","surface_form":"Brione (Verzasca)","offset":546},{"uri":"Frasco","surface_form":"Frasco","offset":574},{"uri":"Sonogno","surface_form":"Sonogno","offset":582},{"uri":"Vogorno","surface_form":"Vogorno","offset":594},{"uri":"Verzasca%2C_Switzerland","surface_form":"Verzasca","offset":641},{"uri":"Valle_Verzasca","surface_form":"Verzasca valley","offset":684},{"uri":"Locarno","surface_form":"Locarno","offset":737},{"uri":"Reservoir","surface_form":"reservoir","offset":769},{"uri":"Lago_di_Vogorno","surface_form":"Lake Vogorno","offset":779},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":824},{"uri":"Granite","surface_form":"granite","offset":874}]}
