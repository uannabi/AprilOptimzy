{"id":8615,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River","text":"The Amazon River (also named \"Rio Amazonas\" in Portuguese and Spanish) is the largest river in the world by the amount or volume of water it carries. It flows through the tropical forests of South America, mainly in Brazil. Its headwaters are in the Andes Mountains in Peru, on the western edge of South America and flows eastward into the Atlantic Ocean near the equator.\nThe Amazon River moves more water than the next eight largest rivers of the world combined and has the largest drainage basin in the world. It accounts for about one fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season, parts of the Amazon exceed in width. Because of its size, it is sometimes called \"The Sea\", but it is not the world's \"longest\" river system. The world's longest river is the Nile River, with the Amazon being second-longest.\nSize and path.\nIt is one of the longest rivers in the world. There have been different studies that have tried to measure its exact length. As the studies have come up with different numbers, it is therefore difficult to give an exact number. The length also changes in the rainy season. Several studies from Brazil, Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world, longer than the Nile. The Nile has a length of. The Amazon may have a length of. The Spanish daily newspaper El Pa\u00EDs gives its length at. In 2007, scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of.\nA study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of. This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac. Until the 1970s, it was thought that the Mara\u00F1\u00F3n River was the source of the Amazon. In 2001, an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was in fact the source of the Amazon. Another document of the Geographic society of Lima gives the length of the Amazon at over.\nThe source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America. It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in the country of Brazil. There are many places on the Amazon where a person on one side of the river cannot see the other side. The Brazilians call the Amazon the \"River Sea.\" The Amazon is navigable from the ocean to Peru. Ocean ships can travel on the Amazon all the way across Brazil, and most of South America, to the city of Iquitos in Peru.\nOne characteristic of the Amazon river is the \"Brazo Casiquiare\", a water connection to the Orinoco river into Venezuela, that connects the two basins.\nEstuary.\nThe estuary of the Amazon is about wide. The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca. Generally, the outlet of the Para River is included. It is wide, and forms the estuary of the Tocantins. The estuary also includes the island of Maraj\u00F3, which lies in the mouth of the Amazon. This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames river in England.\nAlong the coastline, near Cabo do Norte, there are many islands partially covered with water. There are also sandbanks. The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river. This wave goes along the coast for about. The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called a tidal bore. Locally it is known as \"pororoca\". The pororoca occurs where the water is less than deep. It starts with a loud noise, and advances at a speed of. The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta. The ocean rapidly carries away the large amount of silt brought by the Amazon. This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline. It also has a very large tide, that can reach. The place has become popular for river surfing.\nBridges.\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry, so there is no need to build a bridge. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro (a tributary of the Amazon).\nThe river is the main route of traffic in the region. Most cities are on the banks of the river. The biggest city on the river is Manaus, which is also the capital of the Brazilian State of Amazonas. Many native people live in the Amazon, such as the Urarina who live in Peru.\nTrade route.\nBig ocean boats can get up the river until Manaus, which is almost 1500 kilometers (900 miles) from its mouth. Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9\u00A0m (26\u00A0ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru, 3,700\u00A0km (2,300 miles) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780\u00A0km (486\u00A0mi) higher as far as Actual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichia's, just above Actual Point.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Portuguese_language","surface_form":"Portuguese","offset":47},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":62},{"uri":"Drainage_basin","surface_form":"drainage basin","offset":484},{"uri":"Discharge_(hydrology)","surface_form":"river flow","offset":566},{"uri":"Nile_River","surface_form":"Nile River","offset":776},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":1135},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1143},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1153},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":1227},{"uri":"El_Pa%C3%ADs","surface_form":"El Pa\u00EDs","offset":1310},{"uri":"Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n_River","surface_form":"Mara\u00F1\u00F3n River","offset":1557},{"uri":"Expedition","surface_form":"expedition","offset":1613},{"uri":"Nevado_Mismi","surface_form":"Nevado Mismi","offset":1635},{"uri":"Orinoco","surface_form":"Orinoco","offset":2394},{"uri":"Venezuela","surface_form":"Venezuela","offset":2413},{"uri":"Estuary","surface_form":"estuary","offset":2467},{"uri":"Cabo_do_Norte","surface_form":"Cabo do Norte","offset":2565},{"uri":"Punto_Patijoca","surface_form":"Punto Patijoca","offset":2582},{"uri":"Para_River","surface_form":"Para River","offset":2627},{"uri":"Tocantins_River","surface_form":"Tocantins","offset":2692},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":2733},{"uri":"Maraj%C3%B3","surface_form":"Maraj\u00F3","offset":2743},{"uri":"Thames","surface_form":"Thames","offset":2869},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":2885},{"uri":"Island","surface_form":"island","offset":2950},{"uri":"Sandbank","surface_form":"sandbank","offset":3003},{"uri":"Tide","surface_form":"tide","offset":3018},{"uri":"Atlantic","surface_form":"Atlantic","offset":3031},{"uri":"Wave","surface_form":"wave","offset":3051},{"uri":"Phenomenon","surface_form":"phenomenon","offset":3138},{"uri":"Tidal_bore","surface_form":"tidal bore","offset":3197},{"uri":"Pororoca","surface_form":"pororoca","offset":3233},{"uri":"Depth","surface_form":"deep","offset":3293},{"uri":"River_delta","surface_form":"delta","offset":3406},{"uri":"Silt","surface_form":"silt","offset":3464},{"uri":"Shore","surface_form":"shore","offset":3546},{"uri":"River_surfing","surface_form":"river surfing","offset":3637},{"uri":"Bridge","surface_form":"bridge","offset":3674},{"uri":"Engineer","surface_form":"engineer","offset":3803},{"uri":"Amazon_Rainforest","surface_form":"Amazon Rainforest","offset":3911},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":3955},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"cities","offset":3965},{"uri":"Ferry","surface_form":"ferry","offset":4021},{"uri":"Rio_Negro_(Amazon)","surface_form":"Rio Negro","offset":4146},{"uri":"Manaus","surface_form":"Manaus","offset":4315},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":4356},{"uri":"Amazonas_(Brazil)","surface_form":"Amazonas","offset":4375},{"uri":"Urarina","surface_form":"Urarina","offset":4436},{"uri":"Manaus","surface_form":"Manaus","offset":4518},{"uri":"Draft_(nautical)","surface_form":"draft","offset":4638},{"uri":"Iquitos","surface_form":"Iquitos","offset":4664},{"uri":"Peru","surface_form":"Peru","offset":4675},{"uri":"Actual_Point","surface_form":"Actual Point","offset":4780},{"uri":"Pogo_Ode_Escherichia%27s","surface_form":"Pogo Ode Escherichia's","offset":4843}]}
