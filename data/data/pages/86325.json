{"id":86325,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_straightening","text":"e=\"preserve\">Hair straightening is when a person makes their hair straighter. Their hair may be curly, wavy, or almost straight. There are methods to make even very curly hair straighter.\nThere are two different types of straightening: temporary and permanent. Temporary hair straightening keeps the hair straight until it gets wet or damp again, so only lasts for up to a few days. Permanent hair straightening keeps the hair straight for up to a few months, even when the hair gets wet.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[]}
