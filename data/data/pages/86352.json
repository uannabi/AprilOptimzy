{"id":86352,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core","text":"e=\"preserve\">Intel Core is the name of a family of 32-bit dual-core microprocessors. It was made by the technology company Intel. Intel Core processors are based on Pentium M technology. Those processors are more advanced than Intel P6 processors. This architecture, or way to build a processor, is now replaced by Core 2 microarchitecture. In the Core family, there are two groups: the Duo (with two cores) and Solo (Duo with one disabled core). The Solo line replaced the Pentium M one-core processor.\nSeptember 2006 and January 4, 2008 were times when many Core CPUs stopped selling.\nYonah.\nYonah is a company name for Intel's first generation of microprocessors for mobile computers. The Core Duo was released on 5 January 2006. It was the first Intel processor to be used in Apple Inc.'s Macintosh computers. Yonah does not have 64-bit function.\nThe Intel Core Duo has two cores, 2 Mebibytes of L2 cache for both cores, and an arbiter bus that controls the L2 cache and front side bus access.\nThe Intel Core Solo uses two-cores die as a Core Duo, but one core is turned off.\nAdvantages and shortcomings.\nThe duo version of Intel Core (Yonah) has two cores, which give performance per watt almost as good as single-core processors. In computer machines operating with batteries, this means getting as much total work done in one battery charge like in old computers.\nCore-based processor Intel Xeon Sossaman LV (low-voltage), for servers also does not have the Intel 64-bit function. All new server systems have support for x86-64, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 even requires a 64-bit processor to run.\nOn July 27, 2006, Intel released newer Core version Intel Core 2.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"32-bit","surface_form":"32-bit","offset":51},{"uri":"Dual-core","surface_form":"dual-core","offset":58},{"uri":"CPU","surface_form":"microprocessors","offset":68},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":104},{"uri":"Intel","surface_form":"Intel","offset":123},{"uri":"Pentium_M","surface_form":"Pentium M","offset":165},{"uri":"Intel_P6","surface_form":"Intel P6","offset":227},{"uri":"Intel_Core_2","surface_form":"Core 2","offset":315},{"uri":"Microarchitecture","surface_form":"microarchitecture","offset":322},{"uri":"Pentium_M","surface_form":"Pentium M","offset":474},{"uri":"Laptop","surface_form":"mobile computers","offset":670},{"uri":"Apple_Inc.","surface_form":"Apple Inc.","offset":780},{"uri":"Apple_Macintosh","surface_form":"Macintosh","offset":793},{"uri":"64-bit","surface_form":"64-bit","offset":834},{"uri":"Mebibyte","surface_form":"Mebibyte","offset":887},{"uri":"L2_cache","surface_form":"L2 cache","offset":900},{"uri":"Arbiter_bus","surface_form":"arbiter bus","offset":932},{"uri":"Front_side_bus","surface_form":"front side bus","offset":975},{"uri":"Integrated_circuit","surface_form":"die","offset":1033},{"uri":"Intel_Xeon","surface_form":"Intel Xeon","offset":1392},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"server","offset":1434},{"uri":"Microsoft_Exchange_Server_2007","surface_form":"Microsoft Exchange Server 2007","offset":1540},{"uri":"Intel_Core_2","surface_form":"Intel Core 2","offset":1664}]}
