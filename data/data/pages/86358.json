Nowadays map making is the field of study of cartography, a subset of geography. The geographer studies not only the physical details of the environment. He looks at the influence of this physical environment as well. Therefore he looks at human and wildlife ecologies, weather and climate patterns, economics, and culture. He will concentrate on the influence space has for relationships between these elements.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Scientist","surface_form":"scientist","offset":18},{"uri":"Geography","surface_form":"geography","offset":51},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":83},{"uri":"Natural_environment","surface_form":"environment","offset":100},{"uri":"Human","surface_form":"human","offset":116},{"uri":"Habitat","surface_form":"habitat","offset":122},{"uri":"Map","surface_form":"map","offset":185},{"uri":"Cartography","surface_form":"cartography","offset":236},{"uri":"Wildlife","surface_form":"wildlife","offset":441},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecologies","offset":450},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":461},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":473},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":491},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":506}]}
