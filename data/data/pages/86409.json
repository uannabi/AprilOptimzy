{"id":86409,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism","text":"e=\"preserve\">__FORCETOC__\nGnosticism is a group of religious ideas from around the 1st century. \" is the ancient Greek word for \"knowledge\", but now more closely means \"esoteric knowledge\". Gnostic ideas were a main part of early Christianity before being persecuted by other Christians. Gnostic ideas are also found in sects of Judaism and Islam, as well as in alchemy and other kinds of esotericism.\nBeliefs.\nGnosticism says that humans are divine souls trapped in the ordinary physical (or \"material\") world. They say that the world was made by an imperfect spirit.\nThe imperfect spirit is thought to be the same as the God of Abraham. The imperfect spirit may be seen as evil, or sometimes just not perfect but doing the best it can.\nThe real God who is good, is distant and not easy to know. In order to get free from the material world, a person has to get \"gnosis\". That is the special secret knowledge given only to a few special people.\nSome Gnostic groups saw Jesus as sent by the supreme being, to bring \"gnosis\" to the Earth.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Religious","surface_form":"religious","offset":51},{"uri":"1st_century","surface_form":"1st century","offset":83},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"ancient Greek","offset":105},{"uri":"Esoteric","surface_form":"esoteric","offset":169},{"uri":"Early_Christianity","surface_form":"early Christianity","offset":224},{"uri":"Persecution","surface_form":"persecuted","offset":256},{"uri":"Sect","surface_form":"sect","offset":320},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Judaism","offset":329},{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":341},{"uri":"Alchemy","surface_form":"alchemy","offset":362},{"uri":"Esotericism","surface_form":"esotericism","offset":389},{"uri":"Soul","surface_form":"soul","offset":450},{"uri":"Spirit","surface_form":"spirit","offset":561},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":623},{"uri":"Abraham","surface_form":"Abraham","offset":630},{"uri":"God","surface_form":"God","offset":747},{"uri":"Jesus","surface_form":"Jesus","offset":970}]}
