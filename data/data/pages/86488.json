{"id":86488,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Grow_a_Woman_from_the_Ground","text":"\"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" is a 2006 album by Chris Thile, who made the album with the How to Grow a Band, credited to Chris Thile. It was released on September 12, 2006. The album is named after a song on the album; a cover of a song by American singer Tom Brosseau.\nThe album got mostly good reviews from important music critics, with some critics saying that the album was \u201C{fantastic, eclectic\u201D, and \u201Cgenius\u201D. The album got Thile a Grammy Award-nomination in 2007.\nEarly planning and creation.\nFor a side project away from his band Nickel Creek, Chris Thile knew he wanted to form a five-piece string band that featured mandolin, violin, banjo, acoustic guitar, and double bass. Thile also wanted the band to feature his friend and fiddle player Gabe Witcher, but didn\u2019t know what kind of band he wanted it to be. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado, Thile met banjo player Noam Pikelny and later said that \u201Cevery note he played was something I wish I\u2019d played\u201D. At that time, Thile decided that he wanted \u201Cput [his] stamp\u201D on the normal bluegrass band. Thile wanted to find five people to make the five-piece band he planned. He had already found fiddle, banjo, and mandolin players, so he just had to find double bass and acoustic guitar players. The bass player Thile was looking for turned out to be Greg Garrison, a friend of Noam Pikelny. Before this, Pikelny had played with Garrison in the band Leftover Salmon. The guitar player Thile needed became Chris Eldridge, famous as a member of the Infamous Stringdusters. The five people met up in Nashville on one day in 2005 and decided to \u201Cdo something musical together\u201D. A few days later, the group met again \u201Cto drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and [talk] about our failed relationships\u201D. That night, they formed a bluegrass band.\nA few months later, the group decided to record an album. The album was recorded in two days at \"Sear Sound Recording Studios\" in New York City. The album was not made digitally, but in the old-fashioned way: on tape. In an interview with the United States magazine \"Guitar Player\", Chris Thile talked about how \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" was recorded: \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" was produced by Thile, and the only musicians on the album was the band that Thile chose. The band was later named the \"How to Grow a Band\".\nMusical style.\n\"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" takes influence from several musical genres, \u201Cdrawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer-songwriter traditions\u201D. One music critic called the album \u201Croots oriented\u201D. Bluegrass mandolin player Ronnie McCoury became the album\u2019s official \u201Cbluegrass guru\u201D to make sure that there was \u201Csomeone who could make sure we didn\u2019t do anything clich\u00E9d or trite\u201D. When discussing the album\u2019s musical style, Chris Thile said that \u201CAll in all, \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me.\u201D Much of Thile's work on the album was inspired by his divorce, and Thile said that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he \"got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. I\u2019ve always been able to talk to girls, but I\u2019m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chris_Thile","surface_form":"Chris Thile","offset":57},{"uri":"September_12","surface_form":"September 12","offset":162},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":176},{"uri":"Cover_version","surface_form":"cover","offset":230},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":249},{"uri":"Tom_Brosseau","surface_form":"Tom Brosseau","offset":265},{"uri":"Fantastic","surface_form":"fantastic","offset":389},{"uri":"Broad","surface_form":"eclectic","offset":400},{"uri":"Genius","surface_form":"genius","offset":416},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":447},{"uri":"Nickel_Creek","surface_form":"Nickel Creek","offset":547},{"uri":"String_instrument","surface_form":"string","offset":609},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":616},{"uri":"Mandolin","surface_form":"mandolin","offset":635},{"uri":"Violin","surface_form":"violin","offset":645},{"uri":"Banjo","surface_form":"banjo","offset":653},{"uri":"Acoustic_guitar","surface_form":"acoustic guitar","offset":660},{"uri":"Double_bass","surface_form":"double bass","offset":681},{"uri":"Fiddle","surface_form":"fiddle","offset":747},{"uri":"Gabe_Witcher","surface_form":"Gabe Witcher","offset":761},{"uri":"Telluride_Bluegrass_Festival","surface_form":"Telluride Bluegrass Festival","offset":836},{"uri":"Colorado","surface_form":"Colorado","offset":868},{"uri":"Banjo","surface_form":"banjo","offset":888},{"uri":"Noam_Pikelny","surface_form":"Noam Pikelny","offset":901},{"uri":"Bluegrass_music","surface_form":"bluegrass","offset":1065},{"uri":"Fiddle","surface_form":"fiddle","offset":1175},{"uri":"Banjo","surface_form":"banjo","offset":1183},{"uri":"Mandolin","surface_form":"mandolin","offset":1194},{"uri":"Double_bass","surface_form":"double bass","offset":1235},{"uri":"Acoustic_guitar","surface_form":"acoustic guitar","offset":1251},{"uri":"Leftover_Salmon","surface_form":"Leftover Salmon","offset":1430},{"uri":"Infamous_Stringdusters","surface_form":"Infamous Stringdusters","offset":1527},{"uri":"Nashville","surface_form":"Nashville","offset":1577},{"uri":"Wine","surface_form":"wine","offset":1732},{"uri":"Steak","surface_form":"steak","offset":1742},{"uri":"Relationship","surface_form":"relationship","offset":1778},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":1966},{"uri":"Digital","surface_form":"digital","offset":2004},{"uri":"Old-fashioned","surface_form":"old-fashioned","offset":2026},{"uri":"Interview","surface_form":"interview","offset":2060},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2079},{"uri":"Guitar_Player","surface_form":"Guitar Player","offset":2103},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":2438},{"uri":"Musical_genre","surface_form":"musical genre","offset":2461},{"uri":"Bluegrass_music","surface_form":"bluegrass","offset":2511},{"uri":"Acoustic","surface_form":"acoustic","offset":2534},{"uri":"Singer-songwriter","surface_form":"singer-songwriter","offset":2548},{"uri":"Traditions","surface_form":"traditions","offset":2566},{"uri":"Roots","surface_form":"roots","offset":2614},{"uri":"Mandolin","surface_form":"mandolin","offset":2641},{"uri":"Ronnie_McCoury","surface_form":"Ronnie McCoury","offset":2657},{"uri":"Guru","surface_form":"guru","offset":2711},{"uri":"Clich%C3%A9","surface_form":"clich\u00E9d","offset":2796},{"uri":"Dull","surface_form":"trite","offset":2807},{"uri":"Vinyl_record","surface_form":"record","offset":2946},{"uri":"Ordinary","surface_form":"ordinary","offset":3015},{"uri":"Inspiration","surface_form":"inspired","offset":3109},{"uri":"Divorce","surface_form":"divorce","offset":3125},{"uri":"Tom_Brosseau","surface_form":"Tom Brosseau","offset":3199},{"uri":"Complex","surface_form":"complex","offset":3340}]}
