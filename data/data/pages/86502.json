Four of these triangles are orientated upright representing Shiva or the Masculine. Five of these triangles are inverted triangles represent Shakti or the Feminine. Because it is composed of nine triangles, it is also known as the \"navayoni chakra\".\nTogether the nine triangles are interlaced in such a way as to form 43 smaller triangles in a web symbolic of the entire cosmos or a womb symbolic of creation. Together they express Advaita-ism or non-duality. This is surrounded by a lotus of eight petals, a lotus of sixteen petals, and an earthsquare resembling a temple with four doors.\nTEMPLES.\n1.Shri Yantra Temple,This temple is Most Popular and Ancient.\n2.Shri Narmadeshwar Shri Laxmi Yantra Mandir in this temple Siddha Shri is Given by the Priest to Devotees take to home and prey.this temple is Situated Rajpipla city, JIOR pati, Kumbheshwar street,At the Bank of River Narmada.\nOfficial Website:- [https://narmadeshwarshrilaxmiyantramandir.com/ Shri Narmadeshwar Shri Laxmi Yantra Mandir Official Website]","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tripura_Sundari","surface_form":"Tripura Sundari","offset":33},{"uri":"Yantra","surface_form":"yantra","offset":54},{"uri":"Mandala","surface_form":"mandala","offset":64},{"uri":"Bindu","surface_form":"bindu","offset":151},{"uri":"Shiva","surface_form":"Shiva","offset":218},{"uri":"Shakti","surface_form":"Shakti","offset":299},{"uri":"43_(number)","surface_form":"43","offset":476},{"uri":"Advaita","surface_form":"Advaita-ism","offset":590},{"uri":"Non-duality","surface_form":"non-duality","offset":605}]}
