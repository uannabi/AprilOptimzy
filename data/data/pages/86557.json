{"id":86557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasiddha","text":"e=\"preserve\">A mahasiddha (Sanskrit: \"maha\" - great, \"siddha\" - achiever) is type of yogi important in Tantra. They are found in both Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism. They are connected with unusual ways of thinking and with the highest levels of spiritual enlightenment. They are very different from arhats, the saints who gave up the world to achieve buddhahood.\nThe Mahasiddhas are actual people who acquired magical powers from their spiritual practice. A mahasiddha is a bodhisattva, someone who can enter \"nirvana\" whenever they want, but instead choose to stay in \"samsara\" to help others.\nIn both Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions there are 85 Mahasiddhas. The lists are not all the same, but there are many Mahasiddhas who appear on most lists. In Tibetan Buddhist art, they are often shown in paintings together, for example around the border of a \"thanka\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Siddha","surface_form":"siddha","offset":54},{"uri":"Yogi","surface_form":"yogi","offset":85},{"uri":"Tantra","surface_form":"Tantra","offset":103},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":134},{"uri":"Tibetan_Buddhism","surface_form":"Tibetan Buddhism","offset":147},{"uri":"Bodhi","surface_form":"enlightenment","offset":255},{"uri":"Arhat","surface_form":"arhat","offset":299},{"uri":"Buddhahood","surface_form":"buddhahood","offset":351},{"uri":"Bodhisattva","surface_form":"bodhisattva","offset":474},{"uri":"Nirvana","surface_form":"nirvana","offset":510},{"uri":"Samsara","surface_form":"samsara","offset":570},{"uri":"Tibetan_art","surface_form":"Tibetan Buddhist art","offset":759},{"uri":"Thanka","surface_form":"thanka","offset":861}]}
