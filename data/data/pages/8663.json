{"id":8663,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_note","text":"A sticky note (or Post-it note) is a small piece of paper with a strip of glue along one edge that make it \"sticky,\" so you can stick it to things. It was invented by Arthur Fry.\nThe most common sticky note is the Post-it, which is made by a company called 3M. In 1974 a man named Arthur Fry came up with the idea for the sticky note. He used a glue that was originally too weak to be used for anything else, so the notes would come off easy. 3M started to sell Post-Its in 1980.\nIn 2001, the patent for the glue that 3M uses on Post-it notes expired, so many other companies now make similar sticky notes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Arthur_Fry","surface_form":"Arthur Fry","offset":167},{"uri":"3M","surface_form":"3M","offset":257},{"uri":"Patent","surface_form":"patent","offset":493}]}
