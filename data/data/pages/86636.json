On the second day it becomes more successful as she makes new friends, Janice and Damian. When they skip a lesson, Janice and Damian give her a map of the school eating area. It is arranged into different sorts of people and their personalities. At lunch time Cady is on her way to sit with her new friends but is interrupted, then Regina, Gretchen and Karen (\"The Plastics\") ask her to sit with them and so she sits with them.\nSoon, Cady joins the Plastics, and Janice devises a plan to shatter them. Cady convinces Regina to eat these bars that will make her gain weight instead of lose weight.\nHowever, Cady gets too much into the Plastics, and throws a party at her parents' house without their permission. She tries to hook up with Regina's boyfriend, but he does not like her because she's just like a Plastic now. Janice tells Cady that she's just one of the Plastics now.
