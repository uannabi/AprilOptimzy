It has been used to describe stone structures built by people from many parts of the world living in many different times. Many megaliths were used to figure out the dates of the solstices and equinoxes.\nThese structures were built mainly in the Neolithic period. They continued to be built into the Bronze Age. Some were built even earlier in the Mesolithic period.\nA famous example of a megalith is Stonehenge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"stone","offset":22},{"uri":"Structure","surface_form":"structure","offset":44},{"uri":"Monument","surface_form":"monument","offset":57},{"uri":"Mortar_(masonry)","surface_form":"mortar","offset":200},{"uri":"Cement","surface_form":"cement","offset":210},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":253},{"uri":"Stone_structure","surface_form":"stone structure","offset":355},{"uri":"Solstice","surface_form":"solstice","offset":505},{"uri":"Equinox","surface_form":"equinox","offset":519},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":572},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":626},{"uri":"Mesolithic","surface_form":"Mesolithic","offset":674},{"uri":"Stonehenge","surface_form":"Stonehenge","offset":727}]}
