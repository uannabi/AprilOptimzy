{"id":86673,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cromwell","text":"Richard Cromwell (4 October 1626 \u2013 12 July 1712) was the third son of Oliver Cromwell, and the second Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland, for little over eight months, from 3 September 1658 until 25 May 1659. Richard Cromwell's enemies called him \"Hickory Dick\" and \"Queen Dick\".\nRichard Cromwell was not suited to ruling the country. He followed his father as ruler only because he was Oliver's oldest living son, and people expected one of Oliver's sons to follow him. After a short time, he gave up power and he knew that many of the people wanted King Charles II to come back from Holland and rule the country. When it was agreed that Charles would return, Richard thought it would be best for him to leave Britain, and he went to live in France for a while. He changed his name to \"John Clarke\" and travelled around Europe, not returning home for twenty years. When he came back, he lived quietly outside London for the rest of his life.\nStories about Richard.\nThe nursery rhyme \"Hickory Dickory Dock\" is actually about Richard Cromwell. One of Richard's nicknames was Hickory Dick. The mouse in the rhyme runs down when the clock strikes one and Cromwell only reigned for one year.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["British Royalty styles|republic"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oliver_Cromwell","surface_form":"Oliver Cromwell","offset":70},{"uri":"Lord_Protector","surface_form":"Lord Protector","offset":102},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":120},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":129},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":142},{"uri":"3_September","surface_form":"3 September","offset":186},{"uri":"1658","surface_form":"1658","offset":198},{"uri":"25_May","surface_form":"25 May","offset":209},{"uri":"1659","surface_form":"1659","offset":216},{"uri":"Charles_II_of_England","surface_form":"Charles II","offset":569},{"uri":"Nursery_rhyme","surface_form":"nursery rhyme","offset":983},{"uri":"Nicknames","surface_form":"nicknames","offset":1073}]}
