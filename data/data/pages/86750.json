{"id":86750,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodging","text":"e=\"preserve\">Lodging or holiday accommodation is a type of accommodation. People who travel and stay away from home for more than a day need lodging mainly for sleeping. Other purposes are safety, shelter from cold and rain, and to have a place to store luggage and being able to take a shower.\nThey do that in a hotel, hostel or hostal, a private home (for example, a bed and breakfast or guest house place), in a tent, or a caravan/camper (often on a campsite).\nLodging may also refer to when cereal crops fall over, often due to wind or rain pressure, making grain harvest difficult.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Accommodation","surface_form":"accommodation","offset":59},{"uri":"Travel","surface_form":"travel","offset":85},{"uri":"Sleep","surface_form":"sleep","offset":160},{"uri":"Shelter","surface_form":"shelter","offset":197},{"uri":"Cold","surface_form":"cold","offset":210},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":219},{"uri":"Luggage","surface_form":"luggage","offset":254},{"uri":"Hotel","surface_form":"hotel","offset":313},{"uri":"Hostel","surface_form":"hostel","offset":320},{"uri":"Bed_and_breakfast","surface_form":"bed and breakfast","offset":369},{"uri":"Guest_house","surface_form":"guest house","offset":390},{"uri":"Tent","surface_form":"tent","offset":415},{"uri":"Camping","surface_form":"camper","offset":434},{"uri":"Campsite","surface_form":"campsite","offset":453},{"uri":"Cereal","surface_form":"cereal","offset":495},{"uri":"Crops","surface_form":"crops","offset":502},{"uri":"Wind","surface_form":"wind","offset":532},{"uri":"Rain","surface_form":"rain","offset":540},{"uri":"Pressure","surface_form":"pressure","offset":545},{"uri":"Grain","surface_form":"grain","offset":562},{"uri":"Harvest","surface_form":"harvest","offset":568}]}
