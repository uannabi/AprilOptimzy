{"id":8681,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapler","text":"=\"preserve\">A stapler is an office tool that is used to place thin items such as paper together. It uses a small piece of wire (a staple) to put them together. The ends of the staple are pointed and go into the paper. There is also a chain of stores called \"Staples\", which sell office supplies.\nWhen you press the stapler down, it will release a staple. The staple is pressed into the paper, and then bent. That way the pieces of paper get stuck together.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":28},{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":35},{"uri":"Item","surface_form":"item","offset":67},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":81},{"uri":"Staple_(fastener)","surface_form":"staple","offset":130},{"uri":"Paper","surface_form":"paper","offset":211},{"uri":"Chain_store","surface_form":"chain","offset":234},{"uri":"Supply","surface_form":"supplies","offset":286}]}
