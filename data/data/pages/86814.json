{"id":86814,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis%2C_Egypt","text":"e=\"preserve\">Memphis was the ancient capital of the first nome of Lower Egypt, and of the Old Kingdom of Egypt from its foundation until around 2200 BC and later for shorter periods during the New Kingdom. It was an administrative centre throughout ancient history.\nIts ancient Egyptian name was Ineb Hedj (\"The White Walls\"). The name \"Memphis\" () is the Greek of the Egyptian name of the pyramid of Pepi I (6th dynasty), which was Men-nefer, and became Menfe in Coptic. The modern cities and towns of Mit Rahina, Dahshur, Saqqara, Abusir, Abu Gorab, and Zawyet el'Aryan, south of Cairo, all lie within the administrative borders of historical Memphis ().\nMemphis was also known in Ancient Egypt as Ankh Tawy (\"That which binds the Two Lands\") because of the strategic position of the city between Upper and Lower Egypt.\nThe ruins of Memphis are 20\u00A0km (12 miles) south of Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile.\nIn the Bible, Memphis is called Moph or Noph.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Nome_(Egypt)","surface_form":"nome","offset":58},{"uri":"Lower_Egypt","surface_form":"Lower Egypt","offset":66},{"uri":"Old_Kingdom_of_Egypt","surface_form":"Old Kingdom of Egypt","offset":90},{"uri":"New_Kingdom","surface_form":"New Kingdom","offset":193},{"uri":"Ancient_history","surface_form":"ancient history","offset":249},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":356},{"uri":"Pyramid","surface_form":"pyramid","offset":390},{"uri":"Pepi_I","surface_form":"Pepi I","offset":401},{"uri":"Coptic_language","surface_form":"Coptic","offset":464},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":582},{"uri":"Ancient_Egypt","surface_form":"Ancient Egypt","offset":683},{"uri":"Upper_Egypt","surface_form":"Upper","offset":799},{"uri":"Lower_Egypt","surface_form":"Lower Egypt","offset":809},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":873},{"uri":"Nile","surface_form":"Nile","offset":904},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":917}]}
