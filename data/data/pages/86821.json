{"id":86821,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nome_(Egypt)","text":"A Nome (from, \u201Cdistrict\u201D) was an administrative part of ancient Egypt. Nome is a Greek name, used late in Egypt's history; the Egyptian name was \"sepat\".\nThe division of ancient Egypt into nomes happened before 3100 BC. These nomes began as autonomous city-states, but later began to join together. According to ancient tradition, the ruler Menes finally joined all the nomes into a single kingdom.\nThe nomes remain in place for more than 3,000 years.\nLower Egypt, from the Old Kingdom capital Memphis to the Mediterranean Sea, had 20 nomes. The first was based around Memphis, Saqqara, and Giza, in the area occupied by modern-day Cairo. The nomes were numbered in a more or less orderly fashion south to north through the Nile delta. The numbering started in the west, and continued with the higher numbers in the east. Alexandria was in the Third Nome; Bubastis was in the Eighteenth.\nUpper Egypt was divided into 22 nomes. The first of these was centered around Elephantine close to Egypt's border with Nubia at the First Cataract \u2013 the area of modern-day Aswan. From there the numbering progressed downriver in an orderly fashion along the narrow fertile strip of land that was the Nile valley. Waset (ancient Thebes or contemporary Luxor) was in the Fourth Nome, Amarna in the Fourteenth, and Meidum in the Twenty-First.\nList of nomes.\nThe nomes are listed in separate tables for Upper and Lower Egypt\nReferences.\nAlan K.
