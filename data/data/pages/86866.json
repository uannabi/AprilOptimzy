{"id":86866,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replication","text":"Replication is a general word for making a copy. Self-replication is a process by which a thing might make a copy of itself. Biological cells, in suitable environments, reproduce by cell division. The process is self-organising, given the basic machinery of a cell. During cell division, DNA is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction.\nOther kinds of replication occur. RNA viruses use the mechanism of a cell to replicate their own RNA strand and make its protein coat. Retroviruses are one of most important RNA viruses; there are a number of other types. Viruses can only reproduce by taking over the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection. Computer viruses reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers.\nMemes reproduce using the human mind and culture as their reproductive machinery.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cells","surface_form":"cells","offset":136},{"uri":"Cell_division","surface_form":"cell division","offset":182},{"uri":"Self-organising","surface_form":"self-organising","offset":212},{"uri":"DNA","surface_form":"DNA","offset":288},{"uri":"Heredity","surface_form":"transmitted","offset":317},{"uri":"Reproduction","surface_form":"reproduction","offset":349},{"uri":"RNA_virus","surface_form":"RNA virus","offset":397},{"uri":"Retrovirus","surface_form":"Retrovirus","offset":498},{"uri":"Viruses","surface_form":"Viruses","offset":585},{"uri":"Computer_virus","surface_form":"Computer virus","offset":695},{"uri":"Meme","surface_form":"Meme","offset":784}]}
