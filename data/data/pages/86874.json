{"id":86874,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme","text":"A meme (pronounce as \"meem\") is an idea or style which spreads because one person copies it from another.\nOne idea is that culture builds in a way similar to living things. An example would be how viruses spread to different organisms. Memes change as they go, creating controversy, and sculpting society. Just as a virus would, memes evolve from their state, being photoshopped, and exaggerated. Memes can be about anything.\nBiologist and evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins invented the word \"meme\" in 1976. He said that tunes, catch-phrases, beliefs, clothing fashions, ways of making pots, and the technology of building arches were all examples of memes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Idea","surface_form":"idea","offset":35},{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":43},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":123},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"Biologist","offset":426},{"uri":"Richard_Dawkins","surface_form":"Richard Dawkins","offset":462},{"uri":"Melody","surface_form":"tunes","offset":525},{"uri":"Catch-phrase","surface_form":"catch-phrase","offset":532},{"uri":"Belief","surface_form":"belief","offset":547},{"uri":"Fashion","surface_form":"fashion","offset":565},{"uri":"Technology","surface_form":"technology","offset":604}]}
