{"id":8695,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman","text":"Richard Stallman (born March 16, 1953) is the founder of the free software movement, the GNU project, and the Free Software Foundation. He is also a famous hacker. He created GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler, and the GNU Debugger. He is one of the main authors of the GNU General Public License (\"GNU GPL\" or \"GPL\"), the most used free software license, which pioneered the concept of the copyleft.\nSince the mid-1990s, he has spent most of his time as a political campaigner, talking about free software and campaigning against proprietary software, software idea patents and expansions of copyright law. The time that he still spends on programming is spent on GNU Emacs. He is currently supported by various fellowships and maintains a modest standard of living.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Free_software_movement","surface_form":"free software movement","offset":61},{"uri":"GNU","surface_form":"GNU","offset":89},{"uri":"Free_Software_Foundation","surface_form":"Free Software Foundation","offset":110},{"uri":"Hacker","surface_form":"hacker","offset":156},{"uri":"GNU_Emacs","surface_form":"GNU Emacs","offset":175},{"uri":"GNU_Compiler_Collection","surface_form":"GNU C Compiler","offset":190},{"uri":"GNU_Debugger","surface_form":"GNU Debugger","offset":214},{"uri":"GNU_General_Public_License","surface_form":"GNU General Public License","offset":265},{"uri":"Free_software_license","surface_form":"free software license","offset":328},{"uri":"Copyleft","surface_form":"copyleft","offset":386},{"uri":"1990s","surface_form":"1990s","offset":410},{"uri":"Political_campaigner","surface_form":"political campaigner","offset":452},{"uri":"Free_software","surface_form":"free software","offset":488},{"uri":"Proprietary_software","surface_form":"proprietary software","offset":526},{"uri":"Software_idea_patent","surface_form":"software idea patent","offset":548},{"uri":"Copyright","surface_form":"copyright","offset":588},{"uri":"Computer_programming","surface_form":"programming","offset":636},{"uri":"GNU_Emacs","surface_form":"GNU Emacs","offset":660},{"uri":"Fellowship","surface_form":"fellowship","offset":708}]}
