To show that the French language and the Flemish language are equal Brussels is a special bilingual (two-languages) region.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":53},{"uri":"Federation","surface_form":"federal","offset":69},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":315},{"uri":"Brussels","surface_form":"Brussels","offset":362},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French language","offset":448},{"uri":"Flemish_language","surface_form":"Flemish language","offset":472}]}
