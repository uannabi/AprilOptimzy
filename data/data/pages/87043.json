{"id":87043,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)","text":"A cross section is what one gets if one cuts an object into slices.\nIn geometry the correct definition of \"cross section\" is: the intersection of a body in 2-dimensional space with a line, or of a body in 3-dimensional space with a plane.\nA cross section, or section is also an orthographic projection of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object. A floor plan is a section viewed from the top.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geometry","surface_form":"geometry","offset":71},{"uri":"Intersection","surface_form":"intersection","offset":130},{"uri":"Physical_body","surface_form":"body","offset":148},{"uri":"Space_(physics)","surface_form":"space","offset":170},{"uri":"Line","surface_form":"line","offset":183},{"uri":"Plane_(mathematics)","surface_form":"plane","offset":232},{"uri":"Orthographic_projection","surface_form":"orthographic projection","offset":278},{"uri":"Floor_plan","surface_form":"floor plan","offset":379}]}
