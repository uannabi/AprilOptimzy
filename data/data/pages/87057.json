{"id":87057,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebisu","text":"e=\"preserve\">Ebisu (\u6075\u6BD4\u9808, \u6075\u6BD4\u5BFF, \u5937, \u620E), also known as Yebisu or Hiruko (\u86ED\u5B50) or Kotoshiro-nushi-no-kami (\u4E8B\u4EE3\u4E3B\u795E), is the Japanese god of fishermen, good luck and working men, and also the guardian of the health of children. He is one of the Seven Lucky Gods.\nOrigins as Hiruko.\nEbisu was first named \"Hiruko\", meaning \"leech child\". He was the first child of Izanagi and Izanami, born without bones (or, in some stories, without arms and legs) because of his mother's mistake in her marriage. Hiruko tried hard to survive but he was thrown to the sea in a boat made out of reeds. He was eventually washed ashore and was cared for by the Ainu people \"Ebisu Saburo\" (\u620E\u4E09\u90CE).\nLife Story.\nThe weak child overcame many problems, grew legs, and became the god Ebisu. He remains slightly crippled and deaf, but is still joyful (which is why he has the title, \"The Laughing God\"). He is often shown wearing a tall hat \u2014 the \"Kazaori Eboshi\" (\u98A8\u6298\u70CF\u5E3D\u5B50) \u2014 holding a fishing rod and a large sea bass.\nIn Popular Culture.\nThe brand name [http://www.evisu.com/ Evisu] is named after Ebisu.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japanese_mythology","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":115},{"uri":"Seven_Lucky_Gods","surface_form":"Seven Lucky Gods","offset":235},{"uri":"Leech","surface_form":"leech","offset":313},{"uri":"Izanagi","surface_form":"Izanagi","offset":353},{"uri":"Izanami","surface_form":"Izanami","offset":365},{"uri":"Ainu_people","surface_form":"Ainu people","offset":631},{"uri":"Sea_bass","surface_form":"sea bass","offset":969}]}
