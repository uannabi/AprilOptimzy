{"id":87068,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation","text":"e=\"preserve\">A permutation is a single way of arranging a group of objects. It is useful in mathematics.\nA permutation can be changed into another permutation by simply switching two or more of the objects. For example, the way four people can sit in a car is a permutation. If some of them chose different seats, then it would be a different permutation.\nPermutations without repetitions.\nThe factorial has special application in defining the number of permutations in a set which does not include repetitions. The number n!, read \"n factorial\", is precisely the number of ways we can rearrange n things into a new order. For example, if we have three fruit: an orange, apple and pear, we can eat them in the order mentioned, or we can change them (for example, an apple, a pear then an orange). The exact number of permutations is then formula_1. The number gets extremely large as the number of items (n) goes up.\nIn a similar manner, the number of arrangements of r items from n objects is consider a partial permutation. It is written as formula_1 (which reads \"n permute r\"), and is equal to the number formula_1 (also written as formula_1).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":92},{"uri":"Factorial","surface_form":"factorial","offset":394}]}
