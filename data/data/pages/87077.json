{"id":87077,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory","text":"e=\"preserve\">In mathematics and abstract algebra, group theory studies a type of algebraic structure called a group. Group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures, such as a set of numbers along with its addition and multiplication. Because group theory is also useful for studying symmetry in nature and abstract systems, it has many applications in physics and chemistry.\nDefinition.\nAn important fact about groups is that when two elements are combined using the operation, the order of the elements matters. Switching the order of two combined elements typically gives a different result. This means that we have many cases with \"a\" \u2022 \"b\" \u2260 \"b\" \u2022 \"a\".\nHowever, if the order of a and b actually does not matter (for \"any\" a and b, we \"always\" have \"a\" \u2022 \"b\" = \"b\" \u2022 \"a\"), then the group is called an abelian group (or commutative group).\nIf a group contains finitely many elements, then it is called a finite group. If a subset of a group is also a group, then the subset is called a subgroup.\nExamples.\nThe addition operator is also commutative: the order of \"a\" and \"b\" does not matter. For any two integers \"a\" and \"b\" in G, \"a\" + \"b\" = \"b\" + \"a\". For example, 7+3 is the same as 3+7. Thus, \"G\" is also an abelian group.\nCommutative operators are common in our daily lives. For example, 7 \u00B7 3 is also the same as 3 \u00B7 7. However, not all operations are commutative. For example, 7\u00F73 is different from 3\u00F77 (and neither of these results is an integer), and 73 is different from 37. Therefore, not all combinations of number sets and mathematical operations can form an abelian group\u2014or even a group at all.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":16},{"uri":"Abstract_algebra","surface_form":"abstract algebra","offset":32},{"uri":"Algebraic_structure","surface_form":"algebraic structure","offset":81},{"uri":"Group_(mathematics)","surface_form":"group","offset":110},{"uri":"Addition","surface_form":"addition","offset":263},{"uri":"Multiplication","surface_form":"multiplication","offset":276},{"uri":"Symmetry","surface_form":"symmetry","offset":341},{"uri":"Nature","surface_form":"nature","offset":353},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":410},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":422},{"uri":"Abelian_group","surface_form":"abelian group","offset":862},{"uri":"Subset","surface_form":"subset","offset":983},{"uri":"Commutative","surface_form":"commutative","offset":1096},{"uri":"Operation_(mathematics)","surface_form":"operations","offset":1402}]}
