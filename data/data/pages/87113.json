{"id":87113,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Administrative_Court_of_Germany","text":"The Bundesverwaltungsgericht or Federal Administrative Court is one of the five federal supreme courts of Germany. It is the federal court of appeals for generally all cases of administrative law. These cases are mainly arguments between people and the government, but sometimes are disputes between two different parts of government.\nThe Federal Administrative Court was set up on 8 June 1953. It was based in Berlin, but in 2002 moved to the city of Leipzig in Saxony.\nIt hears appeals from the \"Oberverwaltungsgerichte\", or Superior Administrative Courts, which, in turn, are the courts of appeals for decisions of the \"Verwaltungsgerichte\" (Administrative Courts).\nAlthough cases about social security law and tax law are arguments between a person and the government, there are special courts for these matters. The Bundessozialgericht is federal court of appeals for social security law, cases about tax and customs law are decided by the \"Finanzgerichte\" (Finance Courts), and lastly by the Bundesfinanzhof.\nThe \"Bundesverwaltungsgericht\" has its headquarters at the former \"Reichsgericht\" (Reich Court of Justice) building in Leipzig.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Supreme_court","surface_form":"supreme court","offset":88},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":106},{"uri":"Administrative_law","surface_form":"administrative law","offset":177},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":452},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Saxony","offset":463},{"uri":"Bundessozialgericht","surface_form":"Bundessozialgericht","offset":821},{"uri":"Bundesfinanzhof","surface_form":"Bundesfinanzhof","offset":998},{"uri":"Leipzig","surface_form":"Leipzig","offset":1134}]}
