{"id":87205,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-pop","text":"e=\"preserve\">C-pop is short for Chinese popular music (). Most of today's C-pop artists are from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as from other countries where Mandarin or Cantonese languages are used, such as Singapore and Malaysia. However, Taiwanese music has some origins from the Japanese enka so Taiwanese pop is sometimes said to be a different genre from C-Pop.\nThe Four Heavenly Kings.\n\"The Four Heavenly Kings\" of Cantonese pop are Leon Lai, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Jacky Cheung.\nIn the early 1990s, many major Cantonese pop stars (such as Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Samuel Hui, Priscilla Chan and Joseph Koo) decided to retire because of the protests in China in 1989. Cantonese pop needed new talent to fill the gaps left by these retired stars, this led to the beginning of \"the Four Heavenly Kings\" or \"\u56DB\u5927\u5929\u738B\" (\"lit.\" Four Great Kings of Heaven): Jacky Jeung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Leon Lai. They were dominating the media in all forms, from magazines, TV, cinema to music.\nMandarin pop.\nMandarin pop () is a subgenre of C-pop. Also known as Mandopop and Mandapop, Mandarin pop songs are performed in Mandarin. Most Cantonese pop stars also expand their music career into the Mandarin pop scene.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":32},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"popular music","offset":40},{"uri":"Hong_Kong","surface_form":"Hong Kong","offset":97},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":108},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":128},{"uri":"Singapore","surface_form":"Singapore","offset":223},{"uri":"Malaysia","surface_form":"Malaysia","offset":237},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":298},{"uri":"Enka","surface_form":"enka","offset":307},{"uri":"Leon_Lai","surface_form":"Leon Lai","offset":455},{"uri":"Andy_Lau","surface_form":"Andy Lau","offset":465},{"uri":"Aaron_Kwok","surface_form":"Aaron Kwok","offset":475},{"uri":"Jacky_Cheung","surface_form":"Jacky Cheung","offset":490},{"uri":"Alan_Tam","surface_form":"Alan Tam","offset":564},{"uri":"Leslie_Cheung","surface_form":"Leslie Cheung","offset":574},{"uri":"Samuel_Hui","surface_form":"Samuel Hui","offset":589},{"uri":"Priscilla_Chan","surface_form":"Priscilla Chan","offset":601},{"uri":"Joseph_Koo","surface_form":"Joseph Koo","offset":620},{"uri":"1989","surface_form":"1989","offset":686},{"uri":"Jacky_Jeung","surface_form":"Jacky Jeung","offset":872},{"uri":"Andy_Lau","surface_form":"Andy Lau","offset":885},{"uri":"Aaron_Kwok","surface_form":"Aaron Kwok","offset":895},{"uri":"Leon_Lai","surface_form":"Leon Lai","offset":910},{"uri":"Mandarin_language","surface_form":"Mandarin","offset":1129}]}
