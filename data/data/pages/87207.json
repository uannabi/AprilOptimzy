Stefanie's ability to speak many dialects is shown in the songs she sings.\nIn the song \"Cloudy Day\" (called \u5929\u9ED1\u9ED1 in Chinese), she sings in both Mandarin and Min Nan (Taiwanese). \"Cloudy Day\" is an adaptation of a traditional Taiwanese folk song.\nHer album START! contains 6 songs in English: \"Venus\", \"That I Will Be Good\", \"Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough\", \"Silent All These Years\", and \"Hey Jude\"; and a song she wrote called \"Someone\".\nCareer.\nStefanie does most of her recording and performing in Taiwan, where most of her fans are. She also visits China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, where many of her fans are.\nHer first music album was released in June 2000, the self-titled YanZi, published by Warner Music. The album sold over 330,000 copies in Taiwan. Her next album, which was released in December of the same year was titled My Desired Happiness or \u6211\u8981\u7684\u5E78\u798F in Chinese.

START was a collection of songs and cover versions. START! sold over 250,000 copies in Taiwan alone in less than a month and overall 1,000,000 copies sold in mainland China.\nIn 2002 and 2003, Stefanie sang the official theme songs for Singapore's National Day Parade: We Will Get There (\u4E00\u8D77\u8D70\u5230 in Chinese) and One United People (\u5168\u5FC3\u5168\u610F in Chinese). One United People was included on the album Leave.\nIn early 2003, she released the album To Be Continued\u2026 which like her previous releases, was a success. It sold more than 250,000 copies in Taiwan and more than 1,000,000 in China. Only a few months later, she released her seventh album with six new songs mixed with fifteen of her old songs. By the end of 2003, Stefanie had sold over 7,000,000 copies in Asia with just seven albums.\nIn late 2003, she decided to take a one-year break from making music, because she wanted to find again her direction in her career. She returned in late 2004 with a new album titled Stefanie, which was meant to reflect her debut album (self-titled as well, but in Chinese). This was to symbolise her return with a fresh attitude. This album sold more than 2,300,000 copies in Asia; making it her most successful album. She also started her own company called Make Music.\nA Perfect Day was released on 2005, almost one year later. Reviews of this new album were mixed, but Stefanie said that all she wanted was to make quality music, instead of releases that sell well but have a lower level of artistic quality. This album was not her highest-selling, but it had still managed to sell over 1,000,000 copies in Asia.\nIn 2006, Stefanie had 4 full-house concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum. The performances were praised by the media as well as fans. Stefanie also returned to Singapore in a much-anticipated homecoming concert. However, at The Golden Melody Awards 2006 in Taiwan, while performing songs that were meant to be for male singers, she went off-key, due to having not enough sleep, jet lag, and not having enough time to practice. The media said she had shattered her image of a pop diva with great singing skills. Though she had been heavily criticized by the media, many think that she did not perform as bad, instead the media had over-emphasized on her singing that night.\nStefanie\u2019s first album under the Capitol brand is entitled Against the Light or \u9006\u5149 in Chinese. It was released on 22 March 2007. Her decision to leave Warner after 9 albums was partly due to music executive Sam Chen, who now works at EMI. He had collaborated with Stefanie on 8 of her 9 albums.\nOn 26 February 2007, Stefanie returned from Cairo where she and her team were extorted by suspected local gangsters. Stefanie was in Egypt to shoot a PV for her new album. Two men disguised as government officials followed her and the crew and asked for money and even showing a handgun. The crew tried calling the police but the police didn\u2019t believe them. The crew had to hand over a total of over 200,000 yuan in order to continue shooting.\nStefanie\u2019s tenth album Against the Light, has been a major success in Asia. In Taiwan, it sold over 60,000 copies in the first 3 days it was released. In addition, over 500,000 copies were sold within a week in China. Stefanie was also the number one spot in the Taiwanese Music Charts for 4 weeks.\nIn 2007, Stefanie sang the offcial theme song for ASEAN's 40th anniversary celebrations: Rise.
