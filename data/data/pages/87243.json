Li Yin liked classical, American and European music so much that she says she never sang children's songs when she was a child.\nAs she grew older, Li Yin became more into pop music than rock music. She had to secretly listen to pop music because her parents were against it. When she was twelve, she went to a middle school founded by the Sichuan Music College after scoring the highest with her violin-playing, but she chose to become a singer instead.

The PV was ranked #1 on Melon's Video Chart for 30 days.\nIn early 2007, Li Yin promoted the second track of her debut single called \"Y (Why...)\", which is a power ballad.
