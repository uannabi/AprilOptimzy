{"id":87332,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative","text":"e=\"preserve\">Antidifferentiation (also called indefinite integration) is the process of finding a certain function in calculus. It is the opposite of differentiation. It is a way of processing a function to give another function (or class of functions) called an antiderivative. Antidifferentiation is like integration\u2014but without limits. This is why it is called indefinite integration. When represented as single letters, antiderivatives often take the form of capital roman letters such as formula_1 and formula_1.\nSimple antidifferentiation.\nformula_1 (also known as the power rule of integral)\nformula_1\nIntegrating a bracket (\"chain rule\").\nTo integrate a bracket like formula_1, a different method is needed. It is called the chain rule. It is like simple integration, but it only works if the formula_1 in the bracket is linear (has a power of 1), such as formula_1 or formula_1\u2014but \"not\" formula_1 or formula_1.\nExamples.\nformula_1\nformula_1","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Calculus","surface_form":"calculus","offset":118},{"uri":"Derivative_(mathematics)","surface_form":"differentiation","offset":150},{"uri":"Function","surface_form":"function","offset":195},{"uri":"Integral","surface_form":"integration","offset":307},{"uri":"Roman_letter","surface_form":"roman letters","offset":471}]}
