{"id":876,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units","text":"e=\"preserve\">U.S. customary units is the system of units of measurement used to measure things in the United States. The system of Imperial units is similar and in some parts identical.\nLength or distance units include the inch, foot, yard and mile.\nLand units include square miles (2589998.47032 square meter) and acres (4046.8726 square meter).\nCommon volume units are the teaspoon, tablespoon (3 teaspoons), fluid ounce (two tablespoons), cup (8 ounces), pint (2 cups, or 16 fluid ounces), quart (2 pints, or 32 fluid ounces), US gallon (16 cups, 128 fluid ounces, or 3.8 liters).\nA barrel is the unit to measure oil.\nTemperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (\u00B0F). Here is a formula to convert from \u00B0C to \u00B0F: formula_1\nUnits of weight and mass include the pound (453.6 grams), which contains 16 ounces. This should not be confused with the British pound which is a type of money. The different uses of the word \"pound\" can cause confusion. Different sizes of ounce are also in use.\nSome people have been trying to replace these units with the metric system since the 1820s. Much infrastructure in the United States and British Empire was built in past centuries using the old measures. During the 20th century some sectors such as science, medicine and the military of the United States converted to metric but Americans still use the old units for daily purposes. On the other hand, world trade is conducted using the metric system and except for the US, the world uses the metric system for almost all purposes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"System_of_measurement","surface_form":"system of units of measurement","offset":41},{"uri":"Measurement","surface_form":"measure","offset":80},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":102},{"uri":"Imperial_units","surface_form":"Imperial units","offset":131},{"uri":"Inch","surface_form":"inch","offset":223},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"foot","offset":229},{"uri":"Yard_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"yard","offset":235},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":244},{"uri":"Volume","surface_form":"volume","offset":354},{"uri":"Cup_(unit)","surface_form":"cup","offset":442},{"uri":"Pint","surface_form":"pint","offset":458},{"uri":"Gallon","surface_form":"gallon","offset":533},{"uri":"Litre","surface_form":"liter","offset":575},{"uri":"Barrel_(unit)","surface_form":"barrel","offset":586},{"uri":"Oil","surface_form":"oil","offset":616},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Fahrenheit","offset":656},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"\u00B0C","offset":707},{"uri":"Weight","surface_form":"weight","offset":736},{"uri":"Mass","surface_form":"mass","offset":747},{"uri":"Gram","surface_form":"gram","offset":777},{"uri":"British_pound","surface_form":"British pound","offset":848},{"uri":"Ounce","surface_form":"ounce","offset":967},{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"metric system","offset":1051},{"uri":"1820s","surface_form":"1820s","offset":1075},{"uri":"Infrastructure","surface_form":"infrastructure","offset":1087},{"uri":"Military_of_the_United_States","surface_form":"military of the United States","offset":1265}]}
