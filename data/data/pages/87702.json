{"id":87702,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration","text":"e=\"preserve\">Public Administration has two meanings. First it means putting into action government policy. Second, academics study this, and prepare civil servants for working in the public service (the non-political part of the government).\nPublic administration helps improve management and improve policies so that government can work better. Public administrators manage public programs, translate politics into the programs and services that citizens use every day. In universities, professors of public administration study government decision making, analyze policies, and think about how to improve policies and programs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":88},{"uri":"Policy","surface_form":"policy","offset":99},{"uri":"Academic","surface_form":"academic","offset":115},{"uri":"Civil_servant","surface_form":"civil servant","offset":149}]}
