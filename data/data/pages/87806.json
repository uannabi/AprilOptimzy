{"id":87806,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/490_Veritas","text":"490 Veritas is a big asteroid, which may have been involved in one of the more huge asteroid-asteroid collisions of the past 100 million years.\nAt 115 and 125\u00A0km in diameter, Veritas and 92 Undina are the biggest of the 300-strong Veritas family of asteroids. David Nesvorn\u00FD of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder traced the orbits of these bodies back in time, and calculated that they formed in a collision of a body at least 150\u00A0km in diameter with a smaller asteroid some 8 million years ago. Veritas and Undina would have been the biggest pieces of that collision.\nThe thought Veritas collision would have been too far from Jupiter for the pieces to have been slung into a collision course with Earth. However, solar radiation would have caused the resulting dust to drift inward to Earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment.\nToday continuing collisions among Veritas-family asteroids are estimated to send five thousand tons of cosmic dust to Earth each year, 15% of the total.\nIt was found by Max Wolf in 1902. Its provisional name was 1902 JP.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":21},{"uri":"92_Undina","surface_form":"92 Undina","offset":187},{"uri":"Asteroid_family","surface_form":"family","offset":239},{"uri":"Boulder%2C_Colorado","surface_form":"Boulder","offset":314},{"uri":"Jupiter_(planet)","surface_form":"Jupiter","offset":637},{"uri":"Max_Wolf","surface_form":"Max Wolf","offset":1052}]}
