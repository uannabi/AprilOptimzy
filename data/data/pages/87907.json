{"id":87907,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising_(1794)","text":"The Warsaw Uprising of 1794 (also called the \"Warsaw Insurrection\") was started by a group of Polish people who lived in Warsaw. With help from the Polish Army, they tried to stop Russia from controlling the biggest city in Poland. It started on April 17, 1794, which was soon after Tadeusz Ko\u015Bciuszko's victory at an important battle.\nAlthough the Russian army was larger, had better weapons, and killed many Polish people, Russian soldiers started to lose a lot of land and suffered from many deaths.\nThe Polish people had been preparing to fight in the uprising since the spring of 1793. They managed to become very popular: they formed a large army of volunteers who were led by a shoemaker, Jan Kili\u0144ski. Apart from this army, the most famous group to take part in giving the Polish people their freedom were the Poles who had been forced to join the Russian army. A person who watched the fighting was a French artist, Jan Piotr Norblin, who drew pictures of the uprising.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish","offset":94},{"uri":"Warsaw","surface_form":"Warsaw","offset":121},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Polish Army","offset":148},{"uri":"Uprising","surface_form":"uprising","offset":556}]}
