{"id":87908,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishravana","text":"Vai\u015Brava\u1E47a (Sanskrit \u0935\u0948\u0936\u094D\u0930\u0935\u0923) or Vessava\u1E47a (P\u0101li \u0935\u0947\u0938\u094D\u0938\u0935\u0923) is the name of the chief of the Four Heavenly Kings and an important person in Buddhism.\nName.\nThe name Vai\u015Brava\u1E47a comes from the Sanskrit vi\u015Brava\u1E47a which means \"Great Fame\".\nVai\u015Brava\u1E47a is also known as Kubera in Sanskrit or Kuvera in P\u0101li.\nCharacter.\nThe character of Vai\u015Brava\u1E47a is set up on the Hindu god Kubera, but although the Buddhist and Hindu deities share some characteristics, both of them have different functions and myths.\nHe is often shown with a yellow face. He carries an umbrella as a sign of his power. He is also sometimes shown with a mongoose, often shown spitting out jewels. The mongoose is the enemy of the snake, which is a symbol of greed or hatred; the spitting out of jewels shows generosity.\nVai\u015Brava\u1E47a in Therav\u0101da tradition.\nIn the P\u0101li writings of the Therav\u0101da Buddhist tradition, Vai\u015Brava\u1E47a is called Vessava\u1E47a. Vessava\u1E47a is one of the Four Great Kings, each one of which rules over a direction. Vessava\u1E47a's direction is the northern quarter of the world.\nVessava\u1E47a has the name \"Kuvera\" from a name he had from a past life as a rich mill-owner, who gave all the money he got from one of his seven mills to charity, and gave aid to the poor for 20,000 years.\nAs with all the Buddhist deities, Vessava\u1E47a is properly the name of a person who has the god inside him rather than a permanent individual. Each Vessava\u1E47a is a human, and when he dies, he will be replaced by a new Vessava\u1E47a. Like other beings of the C\u0101tummah\u0101r\u0101jika world, his lifespan is 90,000 years, but other sources say nine million years.\nWhen the Buddha was born, Vessava\u1E47a became his follower. He often brought the Buddha and his followers messages from the gods and other humans, and protected them.\nVai\u015Brava\u1E47a in Japan.\nIn Japan, Bishamonten (\u6BD8\u6C99\u9580\u5929), or just Bishamon (\u6BD8\u6C99\u9580) is thought of as a god of war or warriors who wears armor, and a punisher of people who do evil things, a view that is very strange when compared with the more peaceful Buddhist king described above. Bishamon is shown holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand. The Pagoda symbolises the divine treasure house, which holds things that he guards and gives away. In Japanese folklore, he is one of the Japanese Seven Lucky Gods.\nVai\u015Brava\u1E47a in Tibet.\nIn Tibet, Vai\u015Brava\u1E47a is known to be a worldly protector of the Dharma. He is also known as the King of the North. As guardian of the north, he is often shown on temple wall paintings outside the main door. He is also a god of wealth. Vai\u015Brava\u1E47a is sometimes shown carrying a citron, the fruit of the \"jambhara\" tree. The fruit helps pick him out from depictions of Kuvera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":12},{"uri":"Pali","surface_form":"P\u0101li","offset":44},{"uri":"Four_Heavenly_Kings","surface_form":"Four Heavenly Kings","offset":90},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":137},{"uri":"Kubera","surface_form":"Kubera","offset":261},{"uri":"Hindu","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":355},{"uri":"Kubera","surface_form":"Kubera","offset":365},{"uri":"Myth","surface_form":"myth","offset":487},{"uri":"Mongoose","surface_form":"mongoose","offset":613},{"uri":"Pali","surface_form":"P\u0101li","offset":821},{"uri":"Threvada","surface_form":"Therav\u0101da","offset":842},{"uri":"Four_Great_Kings","surface_form":"Four Great Kings","offset":928},{"uri":"Mill_(grinding)","surface_form":"mill","offset":1126},{"uri":"Gautama_Buddha","surface_form":"Buddha","offset":1605},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":1860},{"uri":"Pagoda","surface_form":"pagoda","offset":2092},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":2256},{"uri":"Seven_Lucky_Gods","surface_form":"Seven Lucky Gods","offset":2265},{"uri":"Dharma_(Buddhism)","surface_form":"Dharma","offset":2367},{"uri":"Citron","surface_form":"citron","offset":2579},{"uri":"Kuvera","surface_form":"Kuvera","offset":2669}]}
