{"id":87985,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Hand_Path","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Left Hand Path\" is a term used in occultism for one kind of spiritual path. It is the opposite of the \"Right Hand Path\", which is what most people think of when they think of religion or spirituality.\nThe use of this term in occultism came from a term used in Hindu Tantra, \"Vama marga\" in Sanskrit. This ancient form of tantra used the breaking of rules (taboos) as part of the practice. Rules about diet and sex were broken on purpose. For example, rules against eating meat and drinking alcohol might be broken. Such a practice might require eating meat and drinking alcohol while having sex in a graveyard or cremation ground.\nPeople who follow the Left Hand Path in the West are not interested in giving up pleasure or the world in order to be spiritual. They are not interested in worshiping God or following rules made up by others. They seek to gain power and freedom by breaking through taboos, fears and restrictions.\nMany people link this term with Satanism and black magic, but they are not the same. The Left Hand Path is sometimes described as \"amoral\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Occultism","surface_form":"occultism","offset":48},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spiritual","offset":74},{"uri":"Religion","surface_form":"religion","offset":189},{"uri":"Spirituality","surface_form":"spirituality","offset":201},{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hindu","offset":274},{"uri":"Tantra","surface_form":"Tantra","offset":280},{"uri":"Vama_marga","surface_form":"Vama marga","offset":289},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":304},{"uri":"Taboo","surface_form":"taboo","offset":370},{"uri":"Cremation_ground","surface_form":"cremation ground","offset":627},{"uri":"Taboo","surface_form":"taboo","offset":910},{"uri":"Fear","surface_form":"fear","offset":918},{"uri":"Satanism","surface_form":"Satanism","offset":974},{"uri":"Black_magic","surface_form":"black magic","offset":987}]}
