{"id":87998,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmen","text":"A dolmen is a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb. It usually consists of three or more upright stones (megaliths) supporting a large flat horizontal capstone (table).\nMost date from the early Neolithic period (4000 BC to 3000 BC). Dolmens were usually covered with earth or smaller stones to form a barrow, though in many cases that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone \"skeleton\" of the burial mound intact.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Room","surface_form":"chamber","offset":29},{"uri":"Megalith","surface_form":"megalith","offset":37},{"uri":"Tomb","surface_form":"tomb","offset":48},{"uri":"Megalith","surface_form":"megalith","offset":107},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":196},{"uri":"Tumulus","surface_form":"barrow","offset":303}]}
