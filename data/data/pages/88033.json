{"id":88033,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_(hill)","text":"A Marilyn is a mountain or hill in the British Isles (including Ireland) with a relative height of at least 150 metres (492 ft). The name was coined as an ironic contrast to the designation Munro, that is used of a Scottish mountain with a height of more than 3,000\u00A0feet, which is homophonous with (Marilyn) Monroe.\nThere are currently 1554 Marilyns identified in Great Britain and surrounding islands: 1214 in Scotland, 179 in England 156 in Wales and 5 on the Isle of Man.\nMany of the largest hills are Marilyns, including Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon. On the other hand, many large hills, including some Munros, and other well-known hills are not Marilyns because they do not meet the relative height criterion.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":15},{"uri":"Hill","surface_form":"hill","offset":27},{"uri":"British_Isles","surface_form":"British Isles","offset":39},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":64},{"uri":"Topographic_prominence","surface_form":"relative height","offset":80},{"uri":"Irony","surface_form":"ironic","offset":155},{"uri":"Munro","surface_form":"Munro","offset":190},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"feet","offset":266},{"uri":"Homophone","surface_form":"homophonous","offset":281},{"uri":"Marilyn_Monroe","surface_form":"Monroe","offset":308},{"uri":"Great_Britain","surface_form":"Great Britain","offset":364},{"uri":"Scotland","surface_form":"Scotland","offset":411},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":428},{"uri":"Wales","surface_form":"Wales","offset":443},{"uri":"Ben_Nevis","surface_form":"Ben Nevis","offset":525},{"uri":"Scafell_Pike","surface_form":"Scafell Pike","offset":536},{"uri":"Snowdon","surface_form":"Snowdon","offset":553}]}
