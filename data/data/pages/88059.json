She is called the \"mother of liberation\". She stands for success in work and achievements.\nT\u0101r\u0101 is a tantric deity whose practice is used by followers of the Tibetan branch of Vajrayana Buddhism to develop their inner qualities and understand outer, inner and secret teachings about compassion and emptiness. T\u0101r\u0101 is not found in the Japanese branch of Vajrayana Buddhism, Shingon.\nThere is more than one form of \"T\u0101r\u0101\". They have to do with different forms of the same quality. Bodhisattvas are often considered metaphors for Buddhist virtues.\nIn some schools of Buddhism there are twenty-one T\u0101r\u0101s. A practice text with the title \"In Praise of the 21 T\u0101r\u0101s\" is recited during the morning in all four sects of Tibetan Buddhism.\nThe main T\u0101r\u0101 chant or mantra is \"O\u1E43 t\u0101re tutt\u0101re ture sv\u0101h\u0101\". This Sanskrit mantra is pronounced by Tibetans and Buddhists who follow the Tibetan traditions as \"O\u1E43 t\u0101re tu t\u0101re ture soha\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Buddha","surface_form":"Buddha","offset":70},{"uri":"Tantra","surface_form":"tantra","offset":98},{"uri":"Tibetan_Buddhism","surface_form":"Tibetan Buddhism","offset":117},{"uri":"Vajrayana","surface_form":"Vajrayana","offset":311},{"uri":"Mett%C4%81","surface_form":"compassion","offset":418},{"uri":"Shunyata","surface_form":"emptiness","offset":433},{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":469},{"uri":"Vajrayana","surface_form":"Vajrayana","offset":488},{"uri":"Shingon","surface_form":"Shingon","offset":508},{"uri":"Metaphor","surface_form":"metaphor","offset":648},{"uri":"Virtue","surface_form":"virtue","offset":671},{"uri":"Buddhism","surface_form":"Buddhism","offset":699},{"uri":"Mantra","surface_form":"mantra","offset":887},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":932}]}
