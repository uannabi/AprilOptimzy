{"id":88062,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_(Devi)","text":"In Hinduism, the Goddess Tara (Sanskrit: T\u0101r\u0101, Devanagari: \u0924\u093E\u0930\u093E) meaning \"star\" is the second of the ten Mahavidyas or \"Great Wisdom(Goddesse)s\", Tantric manifestations of Mahadevi, Kali or Parvati. As the star is seen as a beautiful but perpetually self-combusting thing, so Tara is seen at core as the hunger that propels all life.\nIn the Hindu epic The Ramayana, Tara is the name of Bali's queen. Bali is the monkey king who is killed by Rama, at the behest of his brother Sugriva.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hinduism","surface_form":"Hinduism","offset":3},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"Goddess","offset":17},{"uri":"Sanskrit","surface_form":"Sanskrit","offset":31},{"uri":"Devanagari","surface_form":"Devanagari","offset":47},{"uri":"Mahavidyas","surface_form":"Mahavidyas","offset":105},{"uri":"Tantra","surface_form":"Tantric","offset":146},{"uri":"Mahadevi","surface_form":"Mahadevi","offset":172},{"uri":"Kali","surface_form":"Kali","offset":182},{"uri":"Parvati","surface_form":"Parvati","offset":190},{"uri":"Hunger","surface_form":"hunger","offset":304},{"uri":"Ramayana","surface_form":"Ramayana","offset":356},{"uri":"Bali_(Ramayana)","surface_form":"Bali","offset":386},{"uri":"Monkey_king","surface_form":"monkey king","offset":412},{"uri":"Rama","surface_form":"Rama","offset":441},{"uri":"Sugriva","surface_form":"Sugriva","offset":476}]}
