{"id":88070,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpsitone","text":"=\"preserve\">The terpsitone was an electronic musical instrument invented by L\u00E9on Theremin. It consisted of a platform fitted with antennas, through and around which a dancer would control the musical performance. By most accounts, the instrument was nearly impossible to play.\nTheremin only built three of these instruments. Only the last one, made by Theremin in 1978 for Lydia Kavina, still exists today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Electronic_musical_instrument","surface_form":"electronic musical instrument","offset":34},{"uri":"L%C3%A9on_Theremin","surface_form":"L\u00E9on Theremin","offset":76},{"uri":"Antenna","surface_form":"antenna","offset":130},{"uri":"Lydia_Kavina","surface_form":"Lydia Kavina","offset":373}]}
