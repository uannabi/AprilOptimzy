{"id":88072,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukurokuju","text":"In Japan, Fukurokuju (\u798F\u7984\u5BFF) (From Japanese \"fuku\", which means \"happiness\"; \"roku\", which means \"richness\"; and \"ju\", which means \"long life\") is one of the Seven Lucky Gods. He looks a lot like the Chinese star god Shou. Some people think that before becoming a god, he was a Chinese hermit and a reincarnation of a Taoist god.\nUsually shown as being bald, with long whiskers, people say he is a living form of the Southern Polestar. In many pictures, Fukurokuju has a strangely high forehead. He stands with a crane and a turtle, which are symbols of long life. He is also sometimes with a black deer. Ancient legends say a deer turns black if it is over 2000 years old.\nHe is the only member of the Seven Lucky Gods with the ability to bring the dead back to life.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":3},{"uri":"Japanese_language","surface_form":"Japanese","offset":33},{"uri":"Seven_Lucky_Gods","surface_form":"Seven Lucky Gods","offset":156},{"uri":"Hermit","surface_form":"hermit","offset":284},{"uri":"Reincarnation","surface_form":"reincarnation","offset":297},{"uri":"Taoist","surface_form":"Taoist","offset":316},{"uri":"Pole_star","surface_form":"Southern Polestar","offset":415},{"uri":"Forehead","surface_form":"forehead","offset":484},{"uri":"Crane_(bird)","surface_form":"crane","offset":511},{"uri":"Turtle","surface_form":"turtle","offset":523},{"uri":"Deer","surface_form":"deer","offset":597},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legends","offset":611}]}
