{"id":88449,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_sensitive_person","text":"e=\"preserve\">A highly sensitive person (HSP) is very easily affected by things. They are said to have a 'high sensitivity' (or \"innate sensitiveness\" as Carl Gustav Jung originally called it).\nAccording to some researchers, highly sensitive people are about one fifth of the population. They process sensory data much more deeply and thoroughly because their nervous systems are biologically different. This is a specific trait with key effects that have often been confused with shyness, inhibitedness, fearfulness, introversion, as well as other effects. The existence of innate sensitivity was shown using a test. The term is mainly used to describe humans, but may also describe animals.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Innate","surface_form":"innate","offset":128},{"uri":"Carl_Gustav_Jung","surface_form":"Carl Gustav Jung","offset":153},{"uri":"Population","surface_form":"population","offset":275},{"uri":"Senses","surface_form":"sensory","offset":300},{"uri":"Nervous_system","surface_form":"nervous system","offset":359},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biologically","offset":379},{"uri":"Trait_theory","surface_form":"trait","offset":422},{"uri":"Inhibition","surface_form":"inhibitedness","offset":489},{"uri":"Introversion","surface_form":"introversion","offset":517}]}
