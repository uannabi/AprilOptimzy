This may have been the worst two-day mass murder of Jews in all of the Holocaust.\nBackground.\nNazi Germany and other Axis countries occupied Kiev on September 19, 1941. By September 26, the military governor and the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) and Police Leader had decided to kill all of the Jews in Kiev. They said this would be revenge for German soldiers being attacked by some Jewish guerrilla fighters.\nThe massacre.\nOn September 29 and 30, special units of the SS called \"Einsatzgruppen\", and some local Ukrainians who supported the Nazis, took these people to the ravine at Babi Yar. They made them put all of their things in piles. They made them strip naked. The area was so crowded that by the time people heard gunshots, there was no way to escape. The Nazis took people ten at a time into the ravine, made them lay down, and shot them with machine guns.\nBetween September 29 and 30, the Nazis killed 33,771 Jewish people at Babi Yar.\nThe Nazis buried these people in a mass grave. People who had survived being shot were buried alive, along with the dead. Only 29 people survived and were able to escape.\nThe murdered Jews' property was given to Nazi leaders in Kiev.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Ravine","surface_form":"ravine","offset":17},{"uri":"Kiev","surface_form":"Kiev","offset":29},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukraine","offset":37},{"uri":"The_Holocaust","surface_form":"the Holocaust","offset":53},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":68},{"uri":"Soldier","surface_form":"soldier","offset":73},{"uri":"Mass_murder","surface_form":"massacred","offset":82},{"uri":"Jew","surface_form":"Jew","offset":99},{"uri":"Mass_murder","surface_form":"mass murder","offset":163},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":220},{"uri":"Axis_countries","surface_form":"Axis countries","offset":243},{"uri":"Military_occupation","surface_form":"occupied","offset":258},{"uri":"Military","surface_form":"military","offset":316},{"uri":"Governor","surface_form":"governor","offset":325},{"uri":"Schutzstaffel","surface_form":"Schutzstaffel","offset":343},{"uri":"Police","surface_form":"Police","offset":367},{"uri":"Revenge","surface_form":"revenge","offset":450},{"uri":"Guerrilla","surface_form":"guerrilla","offset":508},{"uri":"Einsatzgruppen","surface_form":"Einsatzgruppen","offset":598},{"uri":"Ukraine","surface_form":"Ukrainians","offset":630},{"uri":"Ravine","surface_form":"ravine","offset":691},{"uri":"Naked","surface_form":"naked","offset":781},{"uri":"Gunshot","surface_form":"gunshot","offset":842},{"uri":"Machine_gun","surface_form":"machine gun","offset":972},{"uri":"Mass_grave","surface_form":"mass grave","offset":1101}]}
