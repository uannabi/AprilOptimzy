{"id":88806,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha","text":"Alpha (uppercase/lowercase \u0391 \u03B1), is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, used to stand for the \"a\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 1. Letters that came from it are the Roman A and Cyrillic \u0410.\nAlpha is often used in physics and chemistry as a symbol or in the names of things, for example alpha particles (which are two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle the same as a helium nucleus). The symbol is also used a lot in mathematics in algebra, for example in naming angles, and in statistics, to represent statistical significance level.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":60},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient","offset":111},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern Greek","offset":123},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":154},{"uri":"Roman_alphabet","surface_form":"Roman","offset":225},{"uri":"A","surface_form":"A","offset":231},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic","offset":237},{"uri":"%D0%90","surface_form":"\u0410","offset":246},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":272},{"uri":"Chemistry","surface_form":"chemistry","offset":284},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":299},{"uri":"Alpha_particle","surface_form":"alpha particle","offset":345},{"uri":"Proton","surface_form":"proton","offset":376},{"uri":"Neutron","surface_form":"neutron","offset":392},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":423},{"uri":"Helium","surface_form":"helium","offset":446},{"uri":"Nucleus_(physics)","surface_form":"nucleus","offset":453},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":496},{"uri":"Algebra","surface_form":"algebra","offset":511},{"uri":"Statistics","surface_form":"statistics","offset":557},{"uri":"Statistical_significance","surface_form":"statistical significance","offset":582}]}
