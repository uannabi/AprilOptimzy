{"id":88810,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma","text":"Gamma (uppercase/lowercase \u0393 \u03B3), is the third letter of the Greek alphabet, used to represent the \"g\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 3. Letters that came from it include the Roman C and Cyrillic \u0413.\nIn mathematics, the lowercase \u03B3 is used to represent Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant, and the uppercase \u0393 is used to represent gamma function and gamma distribution. In the physics of wave motions, the lowercase Gamma (\"\u03B3\") is used to represent the ratio of specific heat.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":60},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient","offset":111},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern Greek","offset":123},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":154},{"uri":"C","surface_form":"C","offset":235},{"uri":"%D0%93","surface_form":"\u0413","offset":250},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":256},{"uri":"Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant","surface_form":"Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant","offset":306},{"uri":"Gamma_function","surface_form":"gamma function","offset":374},{"uri":"Gamma_distribution","surface_form":"gamma distribution","offset":393},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":420},{"uri":"Wave_(physics)","surface_form":"wave motions","offset":431}]}
