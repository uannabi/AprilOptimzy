{"id":88820,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta","text":"Eta (uppercase/lowercase \u0397 \u03B7) is a letter of the Greek alphabet. In very early Greek writing it stood for the consonant sound \"h\", but in Classical Greek it stood for a long vowel \"e\". In Modern Greek, it is pronounced as \"i\". In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 8. Letters that came from it include the Roman H and Cyrillic \u0418.\nIn mathematics, the lowercase \u03B7 is used to represent Dirichlet eta function. The same letter is also used to represent conformal time in cosmology, efficiency in telecommunications and elasticity in economics.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":49},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek_language","surface_form":"Classical Greek","offset":138},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern Greek","offset":188},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":244},{"uri":"H","surface_form":"H","offset":325},{"uri":"%D0%98","surface_form":"\u0418","offset":340},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":346},{"uri":"Dirichlet_eta_function","surface_form":"Dirichlet eta function","offset":396},{"uri":"Conformal_time","surface_form":"conformal time","offset":462},{"uri":"Cosmology","surface_form":"cosmology","offset":480},{"uri":"Telecommunication","surface_form":"telecommunications","offset":505},{"uri":"Elasticity_(economics)","surface_form":"elasticity","offset":528},{"uri":"Economics","surface_form":"economics","offset":542}]}
