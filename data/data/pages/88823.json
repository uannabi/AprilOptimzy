{"id":88823,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta","text":"Theta (uppercase \u0398 / lowercase \u03B8), is a letter in the Greek alphabet. It represents the \"th\" sound (as in \"think\") in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 9. The Cyrillic letter \u0472 came from theta.\nIn mathematics, the lowercase \u03B8 is used as a variable to represent an angle, and the uppercase \u0398 is used in big-theta notation (a variant of big-O notation). The lowercase \u03B8 is also used to represent the potential temperature in meteorology.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":54},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient","offset":118},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern","offset":130},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":161},{"uri":"Cyrillic_alphabet","surface_form":"Cyrillic","offset":202},{"uri":"%D1%B2","surface_form":"\u0472","offset":218},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":240},{"uri":"Angle","surface_form":"angle","offset":307},{"uri":"Big_O_notation","surface_form":"big-O notation","offset":378},{"uri":"Meteorology","surface_form":"meteorology","offset":466}]}
