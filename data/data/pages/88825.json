{"id":88825,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda","text":"Lambda (uppercase/lowercase \u039B \u03BB) is a letter of the Greek alphabet. It is used to represent the \"l\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 30. Letters that came from it include the Roman L and Cyrillic \u041B.\nIn mathematics, the lowercase \u03BB is used as a variable for eigenvalues in linear algebra, and as the parameter of both exponential distribution and Poisson distribution. In physics, the same symbol is used as a variable representing wavelength.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":52},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient","offset":109},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern","offset":121},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":152},{"uri":"L","surface_form":"L","offset":234},{"uri":"%D0%9B","surface_form":"\u041B","offset":249},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":255},{"uri":"Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors","surface_form":"eigenvalues","offset":310},{"uri":"Linear_algebra","surface_form":"linear algebra","offset":325},{"uri":"Parameter","surface_form":"parameter","offset":352},{"uri":"Exponential_distribution","surface_form":"exponential distribution","offset":370},{"uri":"Poisson_distribution","surface_form":"Poisson distribution","offset":399},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":424},{"uri":"Wavelength","surface_form":"wavelength","offset":484}]}
