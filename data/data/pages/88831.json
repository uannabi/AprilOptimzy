{"id":88831,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi","text":"Xi (uppercase/lowercase \u039E \u03BE) is the 14th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is used to represent the \"x\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 60. The Roman letter X and Cyrillic letter \u046E came from Xi.\nIn mathematics, both uppercase \u039E and lowercase \u03BE are used to refer to variants of Riemann Xi function (itself a variant of Riemann zeta function). In physics, the uppercase \u039E is used to represent the cascade particle and xi baryon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":55},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient","offset":112},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern","offset":124},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":155},{"uri":"X","surface_form":"X","offset":210},{"uri":"%D1%AE","surface_form":"\u046E","offset":232},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":251},{"uri":"Riemann_xi_function","surface_form":"Riemann Xi function","offset":330},{"uri":"Riemann_zeta_function","surface_form":"Riemann zeta function","offset":371},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":398},{"uri":"Cascade_particle","surface_form":"cascade particle","offset":448},{"uri":"Xi_baryon","surface_form":"xi baryon","offset":469}]}
