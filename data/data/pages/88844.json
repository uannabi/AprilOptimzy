{"id":88844,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon","text":"Upsilon (uppercase/lowercase \u03A5 \u03C5) is the 20th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is used to represent the \"u\" sound in Ancient Greek and \"i\" in Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 400. Letters that came from it include the Roman U, V and Y, and the Cyrillic \u0423.\nIn mathematics, the uppercase formula_1 is used to represent the upsilon function (a variant of Riemann zeta function), while the lowercase formula_1 is used as a general variable. In physics, the uppercase formula_1 is used to represent an upsilon meson. In astrology, the same letter is used for the sign of Aries.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Greek_alphabet","surface_form":"Greek alphabet","offset":60},{"uri":"Ancient_Greek","surface_form":"Ancient Greek","offset":117},{"uri":"Modern_Greek_language","surface_form":"Modern Greek","offset":142},{"uri":"Greek_numerals","surface_form":"Greek numerals","offset":173},{"uri":"U","surface_form":"U","offset":256},{"uri":"V","surface_form":"V","offset":259},{"uri":"Y","surface_form":"Y","offset":265},{"uri":"%D0%A3","surface_form":"\u0423","offset":285},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":291},{"uri":"Upsilon_function","surface_form":"upsilon function","offset":353},{"uri":"Riemann_zeta_function","surface_form":"Riemann zeta function","offset":384},{"uri":"Physics","surface_form":"physics","offset":472},{"uri":"Upsilon_meson","surface_form":"upsilon meson","offset":529},{"uri":"Astrology","surface_form":"astrology","offset":547},{"uri":"Aries","surface_form":"Aries","offset":598}]}
