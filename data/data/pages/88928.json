{"id":88928,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_scale","text":"=\"preserve\">The Rankine scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale. It is based around absolute zero. Rankine is similar to the Kelvin scale in that it starts at absolute zero and 0 \u00B0Ra is the same as 0 K but is different as a change of 1 \u00B0Ra is the same as a change of 1 \u00B0F (Fahrenheit) and not 1 \u00B0C (Celsius). Note that the abbreviation \u00B0R is ambiguous, as it can also refer to the R\u00E9aumur scale.\nThe Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins (K) or 0 degrees Rankine (\u00B0R). The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is \u2212273.15\u00A0\u00B0C or \u2212459.67\u00A0\u00B0F.\nThe Rankine scale was originally used in the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thermodynamics","surface_form":"thermodynamic","offset":35},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":60},{"uri":"Absolute_zero","surface_form":"absolute zero","offset":98},{"uri":"Kelvin","surface_form":"Kelvin scale","offset":139},{"uri":"Absolute_zero","surface_form":"absolute zero","offset":173},{"uri":"Fahrenheit","surface_form":"Fahrenheit","offset":287},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":313},{"uri":"Ambiguous","surface_form":"ambiguous","offset":356},{"uri":"R%C3%A9aumur_scale","surface_form":"R\u00E9aumur scale","offset":395}]}
