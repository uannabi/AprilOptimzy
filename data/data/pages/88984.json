This creates a pleasant and natural sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing.\nThe word \"stereophonic\" comes from Greek \"stereos\" = \"solid\" and \"ph\u014Dn\u0113\" = \"sound\". It was coined by Western Electric.\nIn popular usage, stereo usually means two-channel sound recording and sound reproduction using data from two speakers. The electronic device for playing back stereo sound is often called \"a stereo\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sound","surface_form":"sound","offset":70},{"uri":"Audio","surface_form":"audio","offset":94},{"uri":"Loudspeaker","surface_form":"loudspeaker","offset":100},{"uri":"Greek_language","surface_form":"Greek","offset":245},{"uri":"Western_Electric","surface_form":"Western Electric","offset":311},{"uri":"Channel","surface_form":"channel","offset":372},{"uri":"Sound_recording","surface_form":"sound recording","offset":380},{"uri":"Sound_reproduction","surface_form":"sound reproduction","offset":400},{"uri":"Electronics","surface_form":"electronic","offset":453}]}
