{"id":89118,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich","text":"Stephen Michael \"Steve\" Reich (Born October 3, 1936) is an American composer of music in the style of minimalism. He is known for his music made with tape recordings, and instrumental music with a steady beat (such as Music for 18 Musicians).\nHe also wrote pieces that used what is called a phasing technique. With phasing technique, two parts might be playing the same part but at slightly different speeds. It is almost like a canon, or round. He wrote pieces like these for piano, violin, and, again, for tape recordings.\nHe also composed such pieces like In C and Different Trains, some of his most popular works. Others include, Drumming, City Life and The Cave.\nThe critic Kyle Gann has said Reich \"may...be considered...America's greatest living composer.\"\nOn January 25, 2007, Reich was named the 2007 recipient of the Polar Music Prize, together with jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins. On April 20, 2009, Reich was awarded the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his \"Double Sextet\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":59},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":68},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":80},{"uri":"Minimalism","surface_form":"minimalism","offset":102},{"uri":"Canon_(music)","surface_form":"canon","offset":429},{"uri":"In_C","surface_form":"In C","offset":559},{"uri":"Different_Trains","surface_form":"Different Trains","offset":568},{"uri":"Drumming","surface_form":"Drumming","offset":634},{"uri":"City_Life","surface_form":"City Life","offset":644},{"uri":"The_Cave","surface_form":"The Cave","offset":658},{"uri":"Kyle_Gann","surface_form":"Kyle Gann","offset":679},{"uri":"Polar_Music_Prize","surface_form":"Polar Music Prize","offset":827},{"uri":"Sonny_Rollins","surface_form":"Sonny Rollins","offset":877},{"uri":"Pulitzer_Prize_for_Music","surface_form":"Pulitzer Prize for Music","offset":938},{"uri":"Double_Sextet","surface_form":"Double Sextet","offset":972}]}
