Ledger's body was found by a housekeeper and a massage therapist, who entered the bedroom to find him face down on the floor with sleeping pills on a nearby table. Police said that there were \"no obvious signs\" of suicide. They also did not think his death was caused by someone else.\nAustralian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd released a statement saying, \"It was with great sadness that I have learned of the passing of Heath Ledger... It is tragic that we have lost one of our nation's finest actors in the prime of his life.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":["person"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy
