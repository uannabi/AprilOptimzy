However, in 2010, it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.\nTaipei 101 does not hold the record for tallest building from ground to pinnacle. The Sears Tower has two television antennas on top of it, making its height from the ground to the top of the taller antenna 527\u00A0m (1,729\u00A0ft).\nEffect on Taipei's economy.\nTaipei 101 is the recognized symbol of Taipei city, it brings a lot of tourists every day. The location of Taipei 101 is at the southern end of the Xinyi District, the newest area of Taipei city.

The observatory is spread over 4 floors where visitors can enjoy the fantastic scenery and learn about the engineering marvel that is Taipei 101, the tallest green building in the world. Visitors can buy the tickets on the 5F Taipei 101 Mall, the general ticket costs NT$500 per each and the student ticket (with valid ID) costs NT$450 per each, all children (under 115\u00A0cm) are free. After purchasing the tickets, visitors may take the Guinness World Record breaking high-speed elevator to the observatory on the 89TH floor.\nThe 88th floor is the Beauty of Taiwan Multimedia Corridor, Super Big Wind Damper, Treasure Sky, the hallway connecting the two decks is designed to setting the natural beauty of Taiwan, providing 270-degree views of well-known scenic locations in Taiwan, leading to the engineering marvel known as a wind damper, a 5.5\u00A0meters diameter, 660 ton weight suspended within the building to offset the force of wind and help 101 stand upright. Also included is Treasury Sky, a collection of unique jewel crafts.\nThe 89th floor is the Indoor Observatory, visitors can learn about the design process and construction of Taipei 101 and other similar large-scale building projects around the world, including a free audio tour in eleven languages, as well as high-powered field glasses, snacks, and professional photography service.\nThe 91st floor is an outdoor Observatory.

It has higher safer ratings than Taiwan\u2019s nuclear power plants.\nThe \u201Cdouble stairstep\u201Ddesign reduce the potentially dangerous oscillations caused by high winds by about 30-40%, allowing the structure to stand, even under the force of relentless typhoons. And by now, they\u2019ve become a recognizable design element of the structure.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Chinese"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Building","surface_form":"building","offset":27},{"uri":"Taipei","surface_form":"Taipei","offset":39},{"uri":"Republic_of_China","surface_form":"Republic of China","offset":47},{"uri":"Willis_Tower","surface_form":"Willis Tower","offset":100},{"uri":"Burj_Khalifa","surface_form":"Burj Khalifa","offset":245},{"uri":"Dubai","surface_form":"Dubai","offset":261},{"uri":"Pinnacle","surface_form":"pinnacle","offset":340},{"uri":"Sears_Tower","surface_form":"Sears Tower","offset":354},{"uri":"Xinyi_District","surface_form":"Xinyi District","offset":669},{"uri":"New_Year%27s_Eve","surface_form":"New Year's Eve","offset":892}]}
