{"id":89240,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Haunted","text":"\"Most Haunted\" is a British paranormal television program based on investigating possible paranormal activity. It is shown on the satellite and cable channels Living, Living2 and Virgin 1 (Formerly Ftn), mainly for the UK market. It is also shown in the United States on the Travel Channel and on the W Channel in Australia. It is made by Antix Productions, and is led by Yvette Fielding and her husband Karl Beattie.\nThe show will start their 10th series on February 19, 2008.\nProduction.\nThe team travel around the UK, and also Ireland, the Netherlands and the United States, investigating possible paranormal 'hotspots' for 24 hours.\nThe \"Most Haunted\" team.\nMost Haunted has a main presenter, a psychic medium and a parapsychologist. The parapsychologist's role is to be the skeptic, and to give possible scientifical suggestions for the paranormal activity that happens during the night. These are supported by some of the production crew, who appear in the show and generally have some involvement with many parts of the investigation as they are performing their normal crew role. Most of these on-screen crew members also take part in s\u00E9ances.\nThe show has also featured guest mediums. So far these have been Ian Lawman, Ian Shillito, Gordon Smith, Uri Geller and Kevin Wade. Some episodes have also included at least one celebrity. So far celebrities have included Vic Reeves, Nancy Sorrell, Gaby Roslin, Scott Mills, Mark Chapman, Simon Gregson, Sue Cleaver, Carol Thatcher, Paul O'Grady and Lee Ryan.\nFormer team members.\nThe following is a list of former team and crew members who have given a lot of their time to the show.\nControversy.\nMany times, former \"psychic medium\" Derek Acorah was possessed by a spirit, sometimes evil or sometimes \"lost and confused\". One such case that exposed Acorah was at Bodmin Gaol, Cornwall. Before the filming, Acorah had been fed misinformation about a non-existent ghost of Kreed Kafer by the show parapsychologist Dr. Ciaran O' Keeffe. During the investigation, which was later broadcast, he presented the information as fact and even behaved as though being possessed by the fictional ghost. O'Keeffe later revealed Kreed Kafer is an anagram of 'Derek Faker' in a national newspaper. Even though O' Keeffe exposed Acorah, the paper also claimed that O' Keeffe had exposed the rest of the \"Most Haunted\" team. O'Keeffe later reported that he had been grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the article, and produced a response outlining his version of the show based on his observations and findings, saying he had exposed Derek Acorah and NOT \"Most Haunted\". The show's presenter and executive producer, Yvette Fielding said in an interview that she believes it was a fake possession.\nAlthough not mentioned by O'Keeffe, the \"Mirror\" article also brought into question unedited footage which appeared to show Fielding and Karl Beattie faking 'paranormal' occurrences such as ghostly bumps and knocks. Fielding denied the claims. Thus far none of this footage has come to light, leading to the belief that the \"Mirrors claims were false. Videos purporting to show the team faking paranormal activity have often popped up on the web but are conclusively show nothing damning.\nFurther controversy centred on Derek Acorah again in the West Country, this time in Devon. On the first night filming \"Terror in Torbay\", Acorah mentioned a woman incarcerated by her jealous sister in the cellar of Lupton House, even coming up with the names Margaret and Eleanor. In this case, the facts were right, but the location was wrong. This is the well-known legend of Berry Pomeroy Castle which was to be the last night's location. On the final night, at Berry Pomeroy, Fielding reminded Acorah that he had mentioned the incarcerated sister two nights prior. Acorah glossed over his mistake and changed the subject.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Television"],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"British","offset":20},{"uri":"Paranormal_television","surface_form":"paranormal television","offset":28},{"uri":"Paranormal","surface_form":"paranormal","offset":90},{"uri":"Satellite_television","surface_form":"satellite","offset":130},{"uri":"Cable_television","surface_form":"cable","offset":144},{"uri":"Living_(channel)","surface_form":"Living","offset":159},{"uri":"Living2","surface_form":"Living2","offset":167},{"uri":"Virgin_1","surface_form":"Virgin 1","offset":179},{"uri":"Ftn","surface_form":"Ftn","offset":198},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":254},{"uri":"Travel_Channel","surface_form":"Travel Channel","offset":275},{"uri":"Antix_Productions","surface_form":"Antix Productions","offset":339},{"uri":"Yvette_Fielding","surface_form":"Yvette Fielding","offset":372},{"uri":"Karl_Beattie","surface_form":"Karl Beattie","offset":404},{"uri":"UK","surface_form":"UK","offset":517},{"uri":"Ireland","surface_form":"Ireland","offset":530},{"uri":"The_Netherlands","surface_form":"the Netherlands","offset":539},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":563},{"uri":"Presenter","surface_form":"presenter","offset":686},{"uri":"Mediumship","surface_form":"psychic medium","offset":699},{"uri":"Parapsychology","surface_form":"parapsychologist","offset":720},{"uri":"S%C3%A9ance","surface_form":"s\u00E9ance","offset":1143},{"uri":"Medium_(spirituality)","surface_form":"mediums","offset":1185},{"uri":"Uri_Geller","surface_form":"Uri Geller","offset":1257},{"uri":"Vic_Reeves","surface_form":"Vic Reeves","offset":1374},{"uri":"Nancy_Sorrell","surface_form":"Nancy Sorrell","offset":1386},{"uri":"Gaby_Roslin","surface_form":"Gaby Roslin","offset":1401},{"uri":"Scott_Mills","surface_form":"Scott Mills","offset":1414},{"uri":"Mark_Chapman_(DJ)","surface_form":"Mark Chapman","offset":1427},{"uri":"Simon_Gregson","surface_form":"Simon Gregson","offset":1441},{"uri":"Sue_Cleaver","surface_form":"Sue Cleaver","offset":1456},{"uri":"Carol_Thatcher","surface_form":"Carol Thatcher","offset":1469},{"uri":"Paul_O%27Grady","surface_form":"Paul O'Grady","offset":1485},{"uri":"Lee_Ryan","surface_form":"Lee Ryan","offset":1502},{"uri":"Derek_Acorah","surface_form":"Derek Acorah","offset":1686},{"uri":"Bodmin_Gaol","surface_form":"Bodmin Gaol","offset":1816},{"uri":"Cornwall","surface_form":"Cornwall","offset":1829},{"uri":"Yvette_Fielding","surface_form":"Yvette Fielding","offset":2657},{"uri":"Karl_Beattie","surface_form":"Karl Beattie","offset":2875},{"uri":"West_Country","surface_form":"West Country","offset":3284},{"uri":"Devon","surface_form":"Devon","offset":3311},{"uri":"Berry_Pomeroy_Castle","surface_form":"Berry Pomeroy Castle","offset":3605}]}
