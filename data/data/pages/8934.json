{"id":8934,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn","text":"Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It also covers the same area as Kings County. Brooklyn is the second largest borough in land area.\nIn the early 21st century, about 2.5 million live there. This is more than in any of the other four boroughs.\nBrooklyn is the west end of Long Island. The East River separates it from Manhattan in the north. Brooklyn's only land boundary is with Queens in the east. Jamaica Bay separates Brooklyn from Rockaway in the south. The Narrows separates Brooklyn from Staten Island in the west.\nConey Island is the south end of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Museum is near the middle of Brooklyn, near Prospect Park.\nHistory.\nBrooklyn is named after a Dutch town called \"Breukelen\". Dutch people were the first people from Europe to live in the area. When they got there, there were already some Native American people living there called the Lenape. The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of New Netherland.\nDuring the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there voted to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one culture or ethnicity. Other parts are mixed.\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is old and famous. It goes over the East River and connects Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. The longest bridge in New York, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["settlement"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":28},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":40},{"uri":"Long_Island","surface_form":"Long Island","offset":292},{"uri":"East_River","surface_form":"East River","offset":309},{"uri":"Manhattan","surface_form":"Manhattan","offset":338},{"uri":"Queens","surface_form":"Queens","offset":400},{"uri":"Staten_Island","surface_form":"Staten Island","offset":515},{"uri":"Coney_Island","surface_form":"Coney Island","offset":542},{"uri":"Brooklyn_Museum","surface_form":"Brooklyn Museum","offset":589},{"uri":"Lenape","surface_form":"Lenape","offset":883},{"uri":"New_Netherland","surface_form":"New Netherland","offset":951},{"uri":"Plebiscite","surface_form":"voted","offset":1086},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":1196},{"uri":"Ethnicity","surface_form":"ethnicity","offset":1207},{"uri":"Brooklyn_Bridge","surface_form":"Brooklyn Bridge","offset":1245},{"uri":"East_River","surface_form":"East River","offset":1297},{"uri":"Lower_Manhattan","surface_form":"Lower Manhattan","offset":1342},{"uri":"Verrazano-Narrows_Bridge","surface_form":"Verrazano-Narrows Bridge","offset":1395},{"uri":"Staten_Island","surface_form":"Staten Island","offset":1454}]}
