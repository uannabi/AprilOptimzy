The northern part of Upper Egypt, between El-Aiyat and Asyut is sometimes called Middle Egypt.\nUpper Egypt was known as \"Ta Shemau\" which means \"the land of reeds.\" It was divided into twenty-two districts called nomes. The first nome was roughly where modern Aswan is and the twenty-second was at modern Atfih (Aphroditopolis), just to the south of Cairo.\nFor most of pharaonic Egypt's history Thebes was the administrative centre of Upper Egypt.\nUpper Egypt was represented by the tall White Crown \"Hedjet\", and its symbol was the flowering lotus.\nIt is in this region that the Arab Bedouin were installed before settling between Tunisia and eastern Algeria (Constantinois)","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Aswan","surface_form":"Aswan","offset":93},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":131},{"uri":"El-Aiyat","surface_form":"El-Aiyat","offset":180},{"uri":"Asyut","surface_form":"Asyut","offset":193},{"uri":"Middle_Egypt","surface_form":"Middle Egypt","offset":219},{"uri":"Nome_(Egypt)","surface_form":"nome","offset":351},{"uri":"Aswan","surface_form":"Aswan","offset":398},{"uri":"Atfih","surface_form":"Atfih","offset":443},{"uri":"Atfih","surface_form":"Aphroditopolis","offset":450},{"uri":"Cairo","surface_form":"Cairo","offset":488},{"uri":"Thebes%2C_Egypt","surface_form":"Thebes","offset":533},{"uri":"Hedjet","surface_form":"Hedjet","offset":639},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":656},{"uri":"Nelumbo","surface_form":"lotus","offset":681}]}
