{"id":89871,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubland","text":"Scrubland is plant community with scrub vegetation. \"Scrub\" means low shrubs, mixed with grasses, herbs, and geophytes.\nScrublands are sometimes known as heathlands. Scrublands may develop naturally or as result of human activity. They may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as a major fire.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":40},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":70},{"uri":"Grass","surface_form":"grass","offset":89},{"uri":"Herb","surface_form":"herb","offset":98},{"uri":"Geophyte","surface_form":"geophyte","offset":109},{"uri":"Heathland","surface_form":"heathland","offset":154}]}
