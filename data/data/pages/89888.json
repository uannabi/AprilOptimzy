{"id":89888,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regierungsbezirk","text":"e=\"preserve\">A \"Regierungsbezirk\" is a government region of Germany in some federal states (\"Bundesl\u00E4nder\").\n\"Regierungsbezirke\" are divided into districts (\"Kreise\"), either \"Landkreise\" or urban districts: cities which constitute a district in their own right (\"kreisfreie St\u00E4dte\"). The \"Regierungsbezirk\" is governed by a \"Bezirksregierung\" and led by a \"Regierungspr\u00E4sident\".\nHistory.\nThe first \"Regierungsbezirke\" were created by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1808/16, which divided its provinces into 25 \"Regierungsbezirke\". The \"Regierungsbezirke\" of North Rhine-Westphalia are in direct continuation of those created in 1815. Other states of the German Empire created similar entities, named \"Kreishauptmannschaft\" (in Saxony) or \"Kreis\" (in Bavaria and W\u00FCrttemberg) (not to be confused with the \"Kreis\" or \"Landkreis\" today). During the Third Reich, the Nazi government unified the naming; since then all these entities are called \"Regierungsbezirk\".\nOn January 1 2000 Rhineland-Palatinate disbanded its three \"Regierungsbezirke\" Koblenz, Rheinhessen-Pfalz and Trier - the employees and assets of the three \"Bezirksregierungen\" were converted into three public authorities responsible for the whole state, each covering a part of the former responsibilities of the \"Bezirksregierung\".\nOn January 1, 2004, Saxony-Anhalt disbanded its three \"Regierungsbezirke\": Dessau, Halle and Magdeburg. The responsibilities are now covered by a \"Landesverwaltungsamt\" with three offices at the former seats of the \"Bezirksregierungen\".\nOn January 1, 2005, Lower Saxony disbanded its four \"Regierungsbezirke\": Braunschweig, Hanover, L\u00FCneburg, and Weser-Ems.\nIn 2005, North Rhine-Westphalia planned to abolish its five \"Regierungsbezirke\" and create three self-government entities. The old, \"Prussian-style\", Regierungsbezirk had no self-government organs.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":60},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"\"Bundesl\u00E4nder\"","offset":92},{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":146},{"uri":"Districts_of_Germany","surface_form":"Kreise","offset":158},{"uri":"List_of_German_rural_districts","surface_form":"Landkreise","offset":176},{"uri":"List_of_German_urban_districts","surface_form":"kreisfreie St\u00E4dte","offset":264},{"uri":"Kingdom_of_Prussia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Prussia","offset":439},{"uri":"1808","surface_form":"1808","offset":461},{"uri":"1816","surface_form":"16","offset":466},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"German Empire","offset":650},{"uri":"W%C3%BCrttemberg","surface_form":"W\u00FCrttemberg","offset":758},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Third Reich","offset":842},{"uri":"January_1","surface_form":"January 1","offset":959},{"uri":"2000","surface_form":"2000","offset":969},{"uri":"Rhineland-Palatinate","surface_form":"Rhineland-Palatinate","offset":974},{"uri":"Koblenz_Government_Region","surface_form":"Koblenz","offset":1035},{"uri":"Rheinhessen-Pfalz","surface_form":"Rheinhessen-Pfalz","offset":1044},{"uri":"Trier_Government_Region","surface_form":"Trier","offset":1066},{"uri":"January_1","surface_form":"January 1","offset":1293},{"uri":"2004","surface_form":"2004","offset":1304},{"uri":"Saxony-Anhalt","surface_form":"Saxony-Anhalt","offset":1310},{"uri":"Dessau_Government_Region","surface_form":"Dessau","offset":1365},{"uri":"Halle_Government_Region","surface_form":"Halle","offset":1373},{"uri":"Magdeburg_Government_Region","surface_form":"Magdeburg","offset":1383},{"uri":"January_1","surface_form":"January 1","offset":1530},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":1541},{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxony","offset":1547},{"uri":"Braunschweig_Government_Region","surface_form":"Braunschweig","offset":1600},{"uri":"Hanover_Government_Region","surface_form":"Hanover","offset":1614},{"uri":"L%C3%BCneburg_Government_Region","surface_form":"L\u00FCneburg","offset":1623},{"uri":"Weser-Ems","surface_form":"Weser-Ems","offset":1637},{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":1657}]}
