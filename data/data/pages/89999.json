The term \"volcanology\" comes from the Latin word \"vulcan\", the Roman god of fire.\nA volcanologist is a person who studies volcanoes and their eruptions. Volcanologists visit volcanoes often, especially active ones. This makes it a dangerous science. They analyze physical and chemical variations related to historical and current activity of the volcanoes.\nVolcanologists look at volcanic eruptions, collect material from the eruptions, such as ash or pumice, rock and lava samples.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":3},{"uri":"Geology","surface_form":"geology","offset":66},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":87},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":98},{"uri":"Magma","surface_form":"magma","offset":104},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin","offset":175},{"uri":"Vulcan_(mythology)","surface_form":"vulcan","offset":187},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman god","offset":200},{"uri":"Active_volcano","surface_form":"active one","offset":339},{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcanic eruptions","offset":517},{"uri":"Volcanic_ash","surface_form":"ash","offset":582},{"uri":"Pumice","surface_form":"pumice","offset":589},{"uri":"Rock_(geology)","surface_form":"rock","offset":597},{"uri":"Lava","surface_form":"lava","offset":606}]}
