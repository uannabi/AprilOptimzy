{"id":9002,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga_Filipina","text":"La Liga Filipina was a group created by Doctor Jose Rizal on July 3, 1982 in the Philippines.\nJose Rizal tried very hard to make it a peaceful group. But the Spanish authorities considered it dangerous. On the night of July 6, 1892, Rizal was secretly arrested four days after its creation. The following day, Governor-General Eulogio Despujol ordered Rizal to be deported to Dapitan.\nAfter Rizal's arrest, La Liga Filipina became inactive. Then it was reorganized by Domingo Franco and Andres Bonifacio. The society broke apart into two separate groups: the Cuerpo de Compromisarios which promised to continue supporting the La Solidaridad in Spain and the Katipunan in the Philippines.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Jose_Rizal","surface_form":"Jose Rizal","offset":47},{"uri":"July_3","surface_form":"July 3","offset":61},{"uri":"1982","surface_form":"1982","offset":69},{"uri":"Philippines","surface_form":"Philippines","offset":81},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":158},{"uri":"July_6","surface_form":"July 6","offset":219},{"uri":"1892","surface_form":"1892","offset":227},{"uri":"Eulogio_Despujol","surface_form":"Eulogio Despujol","offset":327},{"uri":"Dapitan","surface_form":"Dapitan","offset":376},{"uri":"Andres_Bonifacio","surface_form":"Andres Bonifacio","offset":487},{"uri":"La_Solidaridad","surface_form":"La Solidaridad","offset":626},{"uri":"Katipunan","surface_form":"Katipunan","offset":658}]}
