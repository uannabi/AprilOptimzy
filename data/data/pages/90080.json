{"id":90080,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene","text":"Polypropylene (PP), or polypropene, is a type of plastic. It is a thermoplastic polymer which can be made into a fibre for yarn and fabric, film for packaging, or many other shapes.\nAs a plastic it can be made translucent but usually is opaque and often brightly colored. It is tough, and resists many solvents, acids and bases.\nIt can be formed into a thin thread and woven into a strong strap, often used on backpacks, bags, and other things.\nIn 2008, the global market for polypropylene had a volume of 45.1 million metric tons, which led to a turnover of about $65 billion (~ \u20AC47.4 billion).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Thermoplastic","surface_form":"thermoplastic","offset":66},{"uri":"Polymer","surface_form":"polymer","offset":80},{"uri":"Fibre","surface_form":"fibre","offset":113},{"uri":"Translucent","surface_form":"translucent","offset":210},{"uri":"Opaque","surface_form":"opaque","offset":237},{"uri":"Solvent","surface_form":"solvent","offset":302},{"uri":"Acid","surface_form":"acid","offset":312},{"uri":"Base_(chemistry)","surface_form":"bases","offset":322},{"uri":"Metric_ton","surface_form":"metric ton","offset":519}]}
