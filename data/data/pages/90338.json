By definition it is one foot times one pound-force.\nUnit of energy.\nAs a unit of energy, one foot-pound is the energy it takes to push with one pound-force one pound for a distance of one foot.\nUnit of torque.\nAs a unit of torque, one foot-pound is the torque created by one pound force acting at a perpendicular distance of one foot from a pivot point.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":102},{"uri":"Torque","surface_form":"torque","offset":128},{"uri":"Pound-force","surface_form":"pound-force","offset":175},{"uri":"Pound-force","surface_form":"pound-force","offset":280},{"uri":"Foot_(unit_of_length)","surface_form":"foot","offset":324}]}
