{"id":90396,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_Pok%C3%A9mon","text":"Legendary Pok\u00E9mon are very rare Pok\u00E9mon in the \"Pok\u00E9mon\" world. Characters in the series often claim that very few people have seen them. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most other Pok\u00E9mon. They have powers that other Pok\u00E9mon do not have. In the games some roam around, while others stay in one spot until the trainer knocks it out or captures it. If the player defeats a legendary Pok\u00E9mon, they will not be available again, because there is only one of them. Because of this, players usually save their game before going to battle the Pok\u00E9mon. The Master Ball and Ultra Ball are popular choices for catching legendary Pok\u00E9mon. But legendary Pok\u00E9mon can also be caught with a normal Pok\u00E9 Ball. It is often advised to catch a legendary Pok\u00E9mon with a Quick Ball since a Quick Ball has a high capture rate at the beginning of a battle. Legendary Pok\u00E9mon typically have a 3/255 catch rate with Ultra Balls, and 1/255 catch rate with regular Pok\u00E9 Balls.\nKanto.\nThese Pok\u00E9mon are in the Kanto region, which appears in \"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue\", and its related games.\nJohto.\nThese Pok\u00E9mon are in the Johto region, which appears in \"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver\", and its related games.\nHoenn.\nThese Pok\u00E9mon are in the Hoenn region, which appears in \"Pok\u00E9mon Ruby and Sapphire\", and its related games.\nSinnoh.\nThese Pok\u00E9mon are in the Sinnoh region, which appears in \"Pok\u00E9mon Diamond and Pearl\", and its related games.\nUnova.\nThese Pok\u00E9mon are in the Unova region, which appears in \"Pok\u00E9mon Black and White\" and \"Pok\u00E9mon Black 2 and White 2.\nKalos.\nThese Pok\u00E9mon are in the Kalos region, which appears in \"Pok\u00E9mon X and Y\".\nAlola.\nThese Pok\u00E9mon are in the Alola region, which appears in \"Pok\u00E9mon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon","offset":48},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Red and Blue","offset":1028},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Gold and Silver","offset":1138},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Ruby and Sapphire","offset":1251},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Diamond_and_Pearl","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Diamond and Pearl","offset":1368},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Black_and_White","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Black and White","offset":1483},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_Black_2_and_White_2","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Black 2 and White 2","offset":1513},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon X and Y","offset":1606},{"uri":"Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y","surface_form":"Pok\u00E9mon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon","offset":1688}]}
