{"id":90421,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War","text":"The Crimean War (1853\u20131856), also called the Eastern War (), was a war fought between Russia on one side, and France, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire on the other side. Most of the fighting, including the Battle of Balaclava, happened in the Crimean Peninsula, with other fighting in western Turkey, and around the Baltic Sea.\nThe Crimean War is sometimes called the first \"modern\" war, since the weaponry and tactics used had never been seen before and affected all other wars after it. It was also the first war where a telegraph was used to quickly give information to a newspaper.\nBackground.\nThe Ottoman Empire was declining by the mid-1800s. European countries, which wanted as much land around the world as possible, looked to the Ottoman Empire. The war itself started after the Ottoman Empire said France, and not Russia, had the right to protect Christians in the Holy Land near the area of modern-day Israel.\nRussia sent an army to take part of Ottoman Romania, so the allied British and French sent an army and navy to stop that. When they got to their camp in Gallipoli, Russia retreated, so the allies decided instead to take back Crimea where Russia had its naval base. Russia had taken Crimea from Turkey in an earlier war.\nDifferences.\nThe Crimean War was a very important point in the history of warfare. It was not only different in the weapons it used, it was also the first war related to by press, by photography and journalists. Another very important factor was that it was the first war with real field hospitals, started by Florence Nightingale. Russia decided to make changes, including increased development of weaponry and the end of serfdom in 1861.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":67},{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":86},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":110},{"uri":"United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":122},{"uri":"Sardinia","surface_form":"Kingdom of Sardinia","offset":142},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":170},{"uri":"Battle_of_Balaclava","surface_form":"Battle of Balaclava","offset":240},{"uri":"Crimea","surface_form":"Crimean Peninsula","offset":277},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":327},{"uri":"Baltic_Sea","surface_form":"Baltic Sea","offset":350},{"uri":"Weapon","surface_form":"weapon","offset":432},{"uri":"Tactic","surface_form":"tactic","offset":445},{"uri":"Telegraph","surface_form":"telegraph","offset":557},{"uri":"Newspaper","surface_form":"newspaper","offset":609},{"uri":"Holy_Land","surface_form":"Holy Land","offset":909},{"uri":"Israel","surface_form":"Israel","offset":947},{"uri":"Romania","surface_form":"Romania","offset":999},{"uri":"Gallipoli","surface_form":"Gallipoli","offset":1108},{"uri":"Crimea","surface_form":"Crimea","offset":1180},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":1338},{"uri":"War","surface_form":"war","offset":1349},{"uri":"Photograph","surface_form":"photograph","offset":1458},{"uri":"Journalism","surface_form":"journalists","offset":1474},{"uri":"Hospital","surface_form":"hospital","offset":1563},{"uri":"Florence_Nightingale","surface_form":"Florence Nightingale","offset":1585},{"uri":"Serfdom","surface_form":"serfdom","offset":1698},{"uri":"1861","surface_form":"1861","offset":1709}]}
