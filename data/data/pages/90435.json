{"id":90435,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reduction","text":"e=\"preserve\">Breast reduction is a plastic surgery to make human breasts smaller. The doctor takes out fat, skin, and glands. It is done on women most of the time, but men can also get it. In 2005, more than 113,000 women had breast reductions.\nAside from aesthetic reasons, many women choose to undergo breast reduction surgery to help reduce back strain, skin irritation, or breathing problems caused by large breasts.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Plastic_surgery","surface_form":"plastic surgery","offset":35},{"uri":"Breast","surface_form":"breast","offset":65},{"uri":"Fat","surface_form":"fat","offset":103},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":108},{"uri":"Gland","surface_form":"gland","offset":118},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":192}]}
