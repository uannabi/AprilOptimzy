{"id":905,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web","text":"The World Wide Web (\"WWW\" or \"The Web\") is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages. It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new markup language called HTML. Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links that are written in HTML.\nThe software to see the World Wide Web is called a web browser. One also needs a connection to the Internet.\nMany companies nowadays offer limited website hosting allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the World Wide Web like any other domain (www.stuff.com) site. These sites usually make money from advertisements instead of fees.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":59},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"website","offset":82},{"uri":"Webpage","surface_form":"webpage","offset":95},{"uri":"Tim_Berners-Lee","surface_form":"Tim Berners-Lee","offset":132},{"uri":"CERN","surface_form":"CERN","offset":151},{"uri":"Geneva_City","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":157},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":165},{"uri":"Markup_language","surface_form":"markup language","offset":212},{"uri":"HTML","surface_form":"HTML","offset":235},{"uri":"Hypertext","surface_form":"hypertext","offset":282},{"uri":"Web_browser","surface_form":"web browser","offset":375},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":423},{"uri":"Web_hosting_service","surface_form":"website hosting","offset":471},{"uri":"Domain_name","surface_form":"domain","offset":576},{"uri":"Advertisement","surface_form":"advertisement","offset":641},{"uri":"Fee","surface_form":"fee","offset":667}]}
