{"id":90547,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitz","text":"G\u00F6rlitz (, Upper Sorbian: |\"Zhorjelc\",) is a town in Germany on the river Lusatian Neisse, in the \"Bundesland\" (\"Federal State\") of Saxony, opposite the Polish town of Zgorzelec. Zgorzelec was a part of G\u00F6rlitz until 1945.\nHistorically G\u00F6rlitz has belonged at times to the regions of Lusatia and Silesia. Today it is the easternmost city in Germany.\nHistory.\nWhen Nazi Germany lost the war, German troops blew up all bridges crossing the Lusatian Neisse. The redrawing of boundaries in 1945 \u2013 in particular the relocation of the German-Polish border to the Oder-Neisse line \u2013 divided the town, the right bank becoming part of Poland, and named Zgorzelec in 1948, while the main portion became part of the German state of Saxony. When the East German states were dissolved in 1952, G\u00F6rlitz became part of the Dresden Bezirk (region), but the states were restored upon German reunification in 1990.\nToday G\u00F6rlitz and Zgorzelec, two towns on opposite banks of the river, have friendly relations. Two bridges have been rebuilt, a bus line connects the German and Polish parts of the town, and there is a common urban management, with annual common sessions of both town councils.\nOn June 27, 1994, the town was became a Roman Catholic diocese.\nG\u00F6rlitz is the hometown of current German football players Michael Ballack and Jens Jeremies.\nIn 2006 G\u00F6rlitz/Zgorzelec was a candidate for European City of Culture 2010. It was hoped that the jury could be convinced by the concept of a Polish-German Cooperation but Essen got the award, with G\u00F6rlitz achieving the second place. The Campaign was renamed City of Culture to intensify German-Polish relationship and to attract tourists from all over the world.\nIn Fiction.\nThe dramatic courtroom scene, at the conclusion of John le Carr\u00E9 famous Cold War spy novel \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\", takes place in a secret Socialist Unity Party of Germany installation near G\u00F6rlitz, in the middle 1960s.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["German location"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sorbian_languages","surface_form":"Upper Sorbian","offset":11},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":53},{"uri":"Lusatian_Neisse","surface_form":"Lusatian Neisse","offset":74},{"uri":"States_of_Germany","surface_form":"Bundesland","offset":99},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Saxony","offset":132},{"uri":"Zgorzelec","surface_form":"Zgorzelec","offset":168},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":217},{"uri":"Lusatia","surface_form":"Lusatia","offset":284},{"uri":"Silesia","surface_form":"Silesia","offset":296},{"uri":"Nazi_Germany","surface_form":"Nazi Germany","offset":364},{"uri":"Second_World_War","surface_form":"war","offset":386},{"uri":"Lusatian_Neisse","surface_form":"Lusatian Neisse","offset":438},{"uri":"1945","surface_form":"1945","offset":486},{"uri":"Oder-Neisse_line","surface_form":"Oder-Neisse line","offset":557},{"uri":"Poland","surface_form":"Poland","offset":626},{"uri":"Zgorzelec","surface_form":"Zgorzelec","offset":644},{"uri":"1948","surface_form":"1948","offset":657},{"uri":"East_Germany","surface_form":"East German","offset":738},{"uri":"1952","surface_form":"1952","offset":775},{"uri":"German_reunification","surface_form":"German reunification","offset":867},{"uri":"1990","surface_form":"1990","offset":891},{"uri":"Football_(soccer)","surface_form":"football","offset":1282},{"uri":"Michael_Ballack","surface_form":"Michael Ballack","offset":1299},{"uri":"Jens_Jeremies","surface_form":"Jens Jeremies","offset":1319},{"uri":"Essen","surface_form":"Essen","offset":1507},{"uri":"John_le_Carr%C3%A9","surface_form":"John le Carr\u00E9","offset":1762},{"uri":"Cold_War","surface_form":"Cold War","offset":1783},{"uri":"The_Spy_Who_Came_in_from_the_Cold","surface_form":"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold","offset":1803},{"uri":"Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany","surface_form":"Socialist Unity Party of Germany","offset":1863}]}
