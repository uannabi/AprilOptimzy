{"id":90694,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron","text":"George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron (22 January 1788 \u2013 19 April 1824) was an English peer, nobleman, politician, and poet. He was christened George Gordon Byron, but changed his name later in life. He adopted the surname Noel, so he that could inherit half his mother-in-law's estate.\nLord Byron was the son Captain John Byron and Catherine Gordon.\nHe was a leading figure in Romanticism. He was regarded as one of the greatest European poets and still many people read his works. Among his best-known works are the narrative poems \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" and \"Don Juan\".\nLord Byron is also famous for the way he lived his life. He was a dandy, living extravagantly, with many love affairs and debts. His fight against the Turks in the Greek War of Independence lead to his death from a fever in Messolonghi in Greece. He is buried in the family vault in St. Mary Magdalene Church, Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, England. A memorial was not raised to him in Poet's Cornerin Westminster Abbey until 1969.\nHe was bisexual (homosexual acts between males were against the law at the time) and he was believed to have been guilty of incest with his half-sister. Lady Caroline Lamb, who was his lover for a time, said that he was \"mad, bad, and dangerous to know.\"\nHis daughter, Ada Lovelace, was famous because she collaborated with Charles Babbage on the \"analytical engine\", a predecessor to modern computers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_people","surface_form":"English","offset":78},{"uri":"Peerage","surface_form":"peer","offset":86},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":118},{"uri":"Infant_baptism","surface_form":"christen","offset":131},{"uri":"Mother-in-law","surface_form":"mother-in-law","offset":262},{"uri":"John_Byron_(British_Army_officer)","surface_form":"John Byron","offset":317},{"uri":"Romanticism","surface_form":"Romanticism","offset":377},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":429},{"uri":"Dandy","surface_form":"dandy","offset":644},{"uri":"Extravagant","surface_form":"extravagantly","offset":658},{"uri":"Greek_War_of_Independence","surface_form":"Greek War of Independence","offset":742},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":793},{"uri":"Messolonghi","surface_form":"Messolonghi","offset":802},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":817},{"uri":"Nottinghamshire","surface_form":"Nottinghamshire","offset":906},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":923},{"uri":"Poet%27s_Corner","surface_form":"Poet's Corner","offset":968},{"uri":"Westminster_Abbey","surface_form":"Westminster Abbey","offset":984},{"uri":"Bisexual","surface_form":"bisexual","offset":1021},{"uri":"Homosexual","surface_form":"homosexual","offset":1031},{"uri":"Incest","surface_form":"incest","offset":1138},{"uri":"Caroline_Lamb","surface_form":"Caroline Lamb","offset":1172},{"uri":"Lover","surface_form":"lover","offset":1199},{"uri":"Ada_Lovelace","surface_form":"Ada Lovelace","offset":1283},{"uri":"Charles_Babbage","surface_form":"Charles Babbage","offset":1338},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":1406}]}
