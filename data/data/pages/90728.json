{"id":90728,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New-age_music","text":"e=\"preserve\">New-age music is a type of music which is often related to New Age belief. It is usually soft and instrumental; it means, only few New Age music pieces have a singer. New Age music is good for resting, thinking and meditation.\nOne of the first people in this genre was Stephen Halpern. He created music to be used for meditation. He could not find a record company for his works, so he published them himself and sold them in New Age stores. His music is very relaxing and has a slow rhythm.\nSome of the famous artists who work in this field are Yanni, Kitar\u014D, Jean Ven Robert Hal, Loreena McKennitt, Vangelis, Enya and George Winston.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"New_Age","surface_form":"New Age","offset":72},{"uri":"Musical_instruments","surface_form":"instrumental","offset":111},{"uri":"Meditation","surface_form":"meditation","offset":228},{"uri":"Genre","surface_form":"genre","offset":272},{"uri":"Stephen_Halpern","surface_form":"Stephen Halpern","offset":282},{"uri":"Meditation","surface_form":"meditation","offset":331},{"uri":"New_Age","surface_form":"New Age","offset":439},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":497},{"uri":"Yanni","surface_form":"Yanni","offset":559},{"uri":"Kitar%C5%8D","surface_form":"Kitar\u014D","offset":566},{"uri":"Jean_Ven_Robert_Hal","surface_form":"Jean Ven Robert Hal","offset":574},{"uri":"Loreena_McKennitt","surface_form":"Loreena McKennitt","offset":595},{"uri":"Vangelis","surface_form":"Vangelis","offset":614},{"uri":"Enya","surface_form":"Enya","offset":624},{"uri":"George_Winston","surface_form":"George Winston","offset":633}]}
