{"id":90745,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Dupr%C3%A9","text":"Marcel Dupr\u00E9 (born Rouen, Normandy, 3 May 1886; died Meudon, near Paris, 30 May 1971), was a leading French organist, composer, and teacher.\nBiography.\nMarcel Dupr\u00E9 was born to a musical family in Rouen (Normandy, France). His father Albert Dupr\u00E9 was organist at the gothic abbey of St Ouen in Rouen. The young Marcel was a child prodigy. He entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1904, where he studied the piano and organ. He studied organ with Alexandre Guilmant and Louis Vierne, and Charles-Marie Widor. His studies with Widor also included composition. In 1914, Dupr\u00E9 won the Grand Prix de Rome for his cantata, \"Psych\u00E9\". Twelve years later, he became professor of organ at the Paris Conservatoire, serving until 1954.\nAmong his best-known work were more than 2,000 organ recitals in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia. In 1920 he played in a series of concerts at the Paris Conservatoire in which he played the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach from memory.\nIn 1934 he succeeded Widor as organist at St. Sulpice in Paris, serving until his death.\nFrom 1947 to 1954, he was director of the American Conservatory, which was in the Ch\u00E2teau de Fontainebleau near Paris. In 1954, Dupr\u00E9 succeeded Claude Delvincourt (who had been killed in a car crash) as director of the Paris Conservatoire, serving until 1956. He died at the age of 85.\nHis playing.\nDupr\u00E9's organ recitals often included his own work, as well as those of other composers, especially Bach. In the tradition of Widor and Vierne, his compositions included long works in several movements which he called \u201Csymphonies\u201D. When he played in church services he would start by playing composed music which was suitable for the time of year. Then he would improvise, playing complicated fugues, trio sonatas and chorale improvisations. He was so good at improvising that many people thought he had composed the music beforehand.\nWhen playing in concerts he was often given a tune, and then he would immediately make up a large work from that tune. In 1906, when he was still a student, he played for a wedding and two services when the famous Widor was going to be absent. Dupr\u00E9 asked Widor what music he should play. Widor told him to improvise something. Dupr\u00E9 waited for Widor to go out of the church before he started practising, but Widor crept back in and listened to him. He realized that Dupr\u00E9 would manage very well.\nHis teaching.\nDupr\u00E9 was famous as an organ teacher. He taught two generations of well-known organists including Jehan Alain, Marie-Claire Alain, Pierre Cochereau, Jeanne Demessieux,Jean Guillou, Jean Langlais, and Olivier Messiaen.\nHis compositions.\nDupr\u00E9 composed a great deal of organ music. As a young child he got to know Aristide Cavaill\u00E9-Coll, the most famous organ builder in France. Cavaill\u00E9-Coll had built the organ that Dupr\u00E9\u2019s father played, so he was used to the sound of modern French organs. Most of Dupr\u00E9's music for the organ is very difficult to play. It includes the \"Three Preludes and Fugues\", Op. 7 (1914). Even Widor thought that the Prelude of the third piece was simply impossible to perform. However, Dupr\u00E9 could play it, and many organists after him learned to play it, too. Other notable works of Dupr\u00E9's include the \"Symphonie-Passion\", the \"Esquisses\" and \"\u00C9vocation\", and the \"Cort\u00E8ge et Litanie\".\nAs well as composing lots of music, Dupr\u00E9 prepared study editions of the organ works of Bach, Handel, Mozart, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Schumann, C\u00E9sar Franck, and Alexander Glazunov. He also wrote music for people who were learning to play the organ, and books on how to improvise on the organ.\nReferences.\n\u201CMarcel Dupr\u00E9 at Saint-Sulpice\u201D \u2013 Gerard Brooks: Organist\u2019s Review Aug 1986 p.\u00A0161-166","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rouen","surface_form":"Rouen","offset":19},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":26},{"uri":"3_May","surface_form":"3 May","offset":36},{"uri":"1886","surface_form":"1886","offset":42},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":66},{"uri":"30_May","surface_form":"30 May","offset":73},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":80},{"uri":"Pipe_organ","surface_form":"organist","offset":108},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":118},{"uri":"Teacher","surface_form":"teacher","offset":132},{"uri":"Rouen","surface_form":"Rouen","offset":197},{"uri":"Normandy","surface_form":"Normandy","offset":204},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":214},{"uri":"Gothic","surface_form":"gothic","offset":267},{"uri":"Abbey","surface_form":"abbey","offset":274},{"uri":"Child_prodigy","surface_form":"child prodigy","offset":324},{"uri":"Paris_Conservatoire","surface_form":"Paris Conservatoire","offset":354},{"uri":"Piano","surface_form":"piano","offset":404},{"uri":"Organ_(music)","surface_form":"organ","offset":414},{"uri":"Alexandre_Guilmant","surface_form":"Alexandre Guilmant","offset":443},{"uri":"Louis_Vierne","surface_form":"Louis Vierne","offset":466},{"uri":"Charles-Marie_Widor","surface_form":"Charles-Marie Widor","offset":484},{"uri":"Prix_de_Rome","surface_form":"Prix de Rome","offset":584},{"uri":"Cantata","surface_form":"cantata","offset":605},{"uri":"Paris_Conservatoire","surface_form":"Paris Conservatoire","offset":680},{"uri":"Recital","surface_form":"recital","offset":774},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":786},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":798},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":813},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":824},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":838},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Johann Sebastian Bach","offset":951},{"uri":"Performing_music_from_memory","surface_form":"memory","offset":978},{"uri":"Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Fontainebleau","surface_form":"Ch\u00E2teau de Fontainebleau","offset":1157},{"uri":"Claude_Delvincourt","surface_form":"Claude Delvincourt","offset":1219},{"uri":"Recital","surface_form":"recital","offset":1388},{"uri":"Movement_(music)","surface_form":"movements","offset":1566},{"uri":"Fugue","surface_form":"fugue","offset":1767},{"uri":"Trio_sonata","surface_form":"trio sonata","offset":1775},{"uri":"Chorale","surface_form":"chorale","offset":1792},{"uri":"1906","surface_form":"1906","offset":2031},{"uri":"Jehan_Alain","surface_form":"Jehan Alain","offset":2518},{"uri":"Marie-Claire_Alain","surface_form":"Marie-Claire Alain","offset":2531},{"uri":"Pierre_Cochereau","surface_form":"Pierre Cochereau","offset":2551},{"uri":"Jeanne_Demessieux","surface_form":"Jeanne Demessieux","offset":2569},{"uri":"Jean_Guillou","surface_form":"Jean Guillou","offset":2587},{"uri":"Jean_Langlais","surface_form":"Jean Langlais","offset":2601},{"uri":"Olivier_Messiaen","surface_form":"Olivier Messiaen","offset":2620},{"uri":"Aristide_Cavaill%C3%A9-Coll","surface_form":"Aristide Cavaill\u00E9-Coll","offset":2732},{"uri":"Johann_Sebastian_Bach","surface_form":"Bach","offset":3422},{"uri":"Handel","surface_form":"Handel","offset":3428},{"uri":"Mozart","surface_form":"Mozart","offset":3436},{"uri":"Liszt","surface_form":"Liszt","offset":3444},{"uri":"Felix_Mendelssohn","surface_form":"Mendelssohn","offset":3451},{"uri":"Robert_Schumann","surface_form":"Schumann","offset":3464},{"uri":"C%C3%A9sar_Franck","surface_form":"C\u00E9sar Franck","offset":3474},{"uri":"Alexander_Glazunov","surface_form":"Alexander Glazunov","offset":3492}]}
