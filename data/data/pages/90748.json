He wrote a lot of music for the organ, including six large works called symphonies, \"24 Fantasy Pieces\" (which includes his famous \"Carillon de Westminster\"), and \"24 Pieces In Free Style\". Some of these can be played on the harmonium as well as on the organ.\nVierne was born in Poitiers. He was almost completely blind from birth. He faced a lifetime of professional frustration, sickness, blindness, loss of family and friends, and disappointments. This all influenced his music.\nHe died while giving an organ recital at Notre Dame.\nOrgan symphonies.\nSymphony No. 6 exploits the full 12-tone chromatic scale. Vierne's pupil Maurice Durufl\u00E9 played the Symphony's first performance at Notre Dame in 1935.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":50},{"uri":"Pipe_organ","surface_form":"organist","offset":57},{"uri":"Composer","surface_form":"composer","offset":70},{"uri":"Symphony","surface_form":"symphonies","offset":152},{"uri":"Harmonium","surface_form":"harmonium","offset":305},{"uri":"Poitiers","surface_form":"Poitiers","offset":359},{"uri":"Blind","surface_form":"blind","offset":394},{"uri":"Notre_Dame_de_Paris","surface_form":"Notre Dame","offset":603},{"uri":"Chromatic","surface_form":"chromatic","offset":674},{"uri":"Maurice_Durufl%C3%A9","surface_form":"Maurice Durufl\u00E9","offset":706}]}
