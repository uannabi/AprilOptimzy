{"id":90765,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulin_Rouge","text":"Moulin Rouge (\"Red Windmill\") is a traditional cabaret and nightclub which began in 1889. It is on Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th \"arrondissement\" (district of the city). This is near the French quarter of Montmartre in the red-light district of Paris called Pigalle. The theatre can be recognized by the large red windmill on its roof.\nThe Moulin Rouge puts on cabaret shows every day. It is where the famous French dance, the Can-can, was first performed. It is also famous because many artists and writers have often gone there. Henri Toulouse-Lautrec designed many posters for the cabaret. Because of this, the management always set aside a table where he could have a meal and watch the show.\nSeveral movies have been made about the Moulin Rouge. The latest is \"Moulin Rouge!\" directed by Baz Luhrmann. Jean Renoir made another film about the Moulin Rouge.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cabaret","surface_form":"cabaret","offset":47},{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"nightclub","offset":59},{"uri":"18%C3%A8me_arrondissement%2C_Paris","surface_form":"18th \"arrondissement\"","offset":126},{"uri":"Montmartre","surface_form":"Montmartre","offset":207},{"uri":"Red-light_district","surface_form":"red-light district","offset":225},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":247},{"uri":"Pigalle","surface_form":"Pigalle","offset":260},{"uri":"Windmill","surface_form":"windmill","offset":316},{"uri":"Can-can","surface_form":"Can-can","offset":429},{"uri":"Henri_Toulouse-Lautrec","surface_form":"Henri Toulouse-Lautrec","offset":533},{"uri":"Moulin_Rouge%21","surface_form":"Moulin Rouge!","offset":768},{"uri":"Baz_Luhrmann","surface_form":"Baz Luhrmann","offset":795},{"uri":"Jean_Renoir","surface_form":"Jean Renoir","offset":809}]}
