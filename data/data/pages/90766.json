Matisse was one of the main artists who helped to create modern art early in the 20th century.\nAlthough he was initially called a Fauve (wild beast), he painted many traditional themes. He painted from life, and his work includes many portraits and other figurative subjects.\nHis mastery of the expressive language of form and colour, in work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art.\nMatisse died of a heart attack in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Le_Cateau-Cambr%C3%A9sis","surface_form":"Le Cateau-Cambr\u00E9sis","offset":15},{"uri":"Nord_(department)","surface_form":"Nord","offset":36},{"uri":"French_people","surface_form":"French","offset":84},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":91},{"uri":"Colour","surface_form":"colour","offset":119},{"uri":"Painting","surface_form":"painter","offset":174},{"uri":"Drawing","surface_form":"draughtsman","offset":201},{"uri":"Printmaking","surface_form":"printmaker","offset":214},{"uri":"Sculpture","surface_form":"sculptor","offset":229},{"uri":"Modern_art","surface_form":"modern art","offset":296},{"uri":"Fauvism","surface_form":"Fauve","offset":369},{"uri":"Portrait","surface_form":"portrait","offset":474},{"uri":"Modern_art","surface_form":"modern art","offset":655},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":685},{"uri":"Nice","surface_form":"Nice","offset":701},{"uri":"Alpes-Maritimes","surface_form":"Alpes-Maritimes","offset":707}]}
