It is situated in the north of Paris and famous for its nightlife.\nMany artists had studios or worked around the community of Montmartre such as Salvador Dal\u00ED, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh.\nName origin.\nMontmartre means 'mountain of the martyr'; it owes its name to the martyrdom of Saint Denis, who was decapitated on the hill around 250 AD. Saint Denis was the Bishop of Paris and is the patron saint of France.\nThe hill's religious symbolism is thought to be even older, as it has been suggested as a likely druidic holy place because it is the highest point in the area.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":131},{"uri":"Salvador_Dal%C3%AD","surface_form":"Salvador Dal\u00ED","offset":245},{"uri":"Claude_Monet","surface_form":"Claude Monet","offset":260},{"uri":"Pablo_Picasso","surface_form":"Pablo Picasso","offset":274},{"uri":"Vincent_van_Gogh","surface_form":"Vincent van Gogh","offset":292},{"uri":"Denis","surface_form":"Saint Denis","offset":403},{"uri":"Bishop_of_Paris","surface_form":"Bishop of Paris","offset":483},{"uri":"Patron_saint","surface_form":"patron saint","offset":510},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":526},{"uri":"Druid","surface_form":"druid","offset":631}]}
