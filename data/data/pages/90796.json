{"id":90796,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound","text":"The speed of sound is per hour or per second in dry air in room temperature. It travels at 1500 meters per second through water. Sound moves faster through liquids and solids than air, since they have a larger specific modulus, meaning they are stiffer. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum, which is a space without any air or matter. The speed of sound is affected by temperature. It travels slower at low temperatures, for example in the stratosphere.\nformula_1\nformula_1 is the ratio of specific heats (1.4 for air)\nR is the gas constant (formula_1 for air)\nThe speed of sound is also known as Mach 1. Things that go faster are supersonic, and things that go five times that speed (Mach 5) are hypersonic.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Room_temperature","surface_form":"room temperature","offset":59},{"uri":"Vacuum","surface_form":"vacuum","offset":284},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":408},{"uri":"Stratosphere","surface_form":"stratosphere","offset":441},{"uri":"Mach_number","surface_form":"Mach","offset":598},{"uri":"Supersonic","surface_form":"supersonic","offset":632}]}
