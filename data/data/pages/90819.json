{"id":90819,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis","text":"Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a virus that causes a serious disease. It is spread from person to person.\nMost of the time, polio has no symptoms unless the polio virus gets into the blood. It is uncommon for the virus to enter the brain or spinal cord. If this does happen, it can cause muscles to become paralyzed. Some people get better from the paralysis. Others will be disabled. Depending on which muscles have been affected, these people may need a mobility aid or a wheelchair; they may have difficulty using their hands; or they may even have trouble breathing.\nAbout 15 out of every 10,000 adults who get polio die. (This means an adult has a 0.015% chance of dying from polio.)\nVaccination with polio vaccines could stop the disease all over the world. Organizations like the World Health Organization have been trying to vaccinate as many people as possible against polio. Vaccinations have eliminated polio from most countries in the world.\nWorldwide, polio has become much less common in the past few decades. In 1988, there were about 350,000 cases of polio in the world. By 2007, the number of cases of polio in the world had decreased by over 99.9%, to just 1,652 cases.\nThe 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, had polio. So far, he is the only President of the United States to have had this disease.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Virus_(biology)","surface_form":"virus","offset":30},{"uri":"Infectious_disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":58},{"uri":"Infectious_disease","surface_form":"spread from person to person","offset":73},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":134},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"blood","offset":180},{"uri":"Central_nervous_system","surface_form":"brain or spinal cord","offset":229},{"uri":"Muscle","surface_form":"muscles","offset":285},{"uri":"Paralysis","surface_form":"paralyzed","offset":303},{"uri":"Disabled","surface_form":"disabled","offset":372},{"uri":"Mobility_aid","surface_form":"mobility aid","offset":453},{"uri":"Wheelchair","surface_form":"wheelchair","offset":471},{"uri":"Breathing","surface_form":"breathing","offset":557},{"uri":"Vaccination","surface_form":"Vaccination","offset":686},{"uri":"Polio_vaccine","surface_form":"polio vaccine","offset":703},{"uri":"World_Health_Organization","surface_form":"World Health Organization","offset":784},{"uri":"Decade","surface_form":"decades","offset":1012},{"uri":"President_of_the_United_States_of_America","surface_form":"President of the United States","offset":1194},{"uri":"Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt","surface_form":"Franklin Delano Roosevelt","offset":1226}]}
