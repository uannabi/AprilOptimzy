{"id":90857,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuz%C3%BBl%C3%AE","text":"Fu\u017C\u016Bl\u012B (\u0641\u0636\u0648\u0644\u06CC) was the pen name of the poet Muhammad bin Suleyman (\u0645\u062D\u0645\u062F \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u064A\u0645\u0627\u0646) (c. 1483 \u2013 1556). He is one of the greatest contributors to the D\u00EEv\u00E2n tradition of Turkish literature,\nFuz\u00FBl\u00EE wrote his collected poems (d\u00EEv\u00E2n) in three different languages: Azerbaijani Turkish, Persian, and Arabic. Although his Turkish works are written in Azerbaijani, he knew both the Ottoman and the Chagatai Turkish literary traditions as well. He was also very able in mathematics and astronomy.\nLife.\nFuz\u00FBl\u00EE was born around 1483 in what is now Iraq; he was probably born in either Karbal\u0101\u2019 or an-Najaf. Fuz\u00FBl\u00EE's ancestors had been of nomadic origin, but his family had long since settled in towns.\nFuz\u00FBl\u00EE was educated by his father\u2014who was a mufti in the city of Al Hillah \u2014 and then by a teacher named Rahmetullah. It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani.\nOne of the few things that is known of Fuz\u00FBl\u00EE's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the introduction to his collected Persian poems, he says: \"In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name\". Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word \"fuz\u00FBl\u00EE\"\u2014which literally means \"impertinent, improper, unnecessary\"\u2014because he \"knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else\". Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning\u2014what is called \"tevriyye\" (\u062A\u0648\u0631\u064A\u0647) in Ottoman Divan poetry \u2014 as Fuz\u00FBl\u00EE himself explains: \"I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary \"fuz\u00FBl\" (\uFED3\uFEC0\uFEEE\u0644) is given as a plural of \"fazl\" (\uFED3\uFEC0\uFEDE; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as \"\u2018ul\u00FBm\" (\uFECB\uFEE0\uFEEE\u0645; 'sciences') and \"f\u00FCn\u00FBn\" (\uFED3\uFEE8\uFEEE\u0646; 'arts')\".\nThe loss of his stipend meant that Fuz\u00FBl\u00EE never became secure. He died during a plague outbreak in 1556, in Karbal\u0101\u2019, either of the plague itself or of cholera.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pen_name","surface_form":"pen name","offset":23},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":39},{"uri":"Ottoman_poetry","surface_form":"D\u00EEv\u00E2n tradition","offset":147},{"uri":"Turkish_literature","surface_form":"Turkish literature","offset":166},{"uri":"Diwan_(poetry)","surface_form":"d\u00EEv\u00E2n","offset":220},{"uri":"Azerbaijani_language","surface_form":"Azerbaijani Turkish","offset":257},{"uri":"Persian_language","surface_form":"Persian","offset":278},{"uri":"Arabic_language","surface_form":"Arabic","offset":291},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman","offset":371},{"uri":"Chagatai_language","surface_form":"Chagatai","offset":387},{"uri":"Mathematics","surface_form":"mathematics","offset":458},{"uri":"Astronomy","surface_form":"astronomy","offset":474},{"uri":"Iraq","surface_form":"Iraq","offset":534},{"uri":"Karbala","surface_form":"Karbal\u0101\u2019","offset":571},{"uri":"Najaf","surface_form":"an-Najaf","offset":583},{"uri":"Nomad","surface_form":"nomad","offset":624},{"uri":"Mufti","surface_form":"mufti","offset":732},{"uri":"Al_Hillah","surface_form":"Al Hillah","offset":753},{"uri":"Pun","surface_form":"double meaning","offset":1552},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman","offset":1604},{"uri":"Bubonic_plague","surface_form":"plague","offset":2002},{"uri":"Cholera","surface_form":"cholera","offset":2074}]}
