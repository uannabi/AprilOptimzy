{"id":9096,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson_(band)","text":"e=\"preserve\">Marilyn Manson is a rock band, and also the name of the lead singer of the group. The name Marilyn Manson was taken from the first name of actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe and the last name of cult leader and serial killer Charles Manson. Some of the earlier band members also created stage names by taking the first name of a female sex symbol and the last name of a serial killer.\nBand history.\nWhen the band started in 1989 it was originally called \"Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids\". The band had four bandmembers and a drumming machine. They played small concerts in their home state Florida (the Warner family had moved from Ohio to Florida when Manson was a teenager).\nIn 1993 frontman Manson met Trent Reznor, lead singer for Nine Inch Nails. Reznor liked their style and offered them a record deal and the chance to tour with Nine Inch Nails. To get the deal, the band had to change its name to just \"Marilyn Manson\". They also had to find a real drummer.\nIn 1995, their cover of Sweet Dreams (originally by Eurythmics) became a hit, and the band was suddenly very popular.\nThe band is very good friends with Nat Morley who is often featured in their music videos.\nDiscography.\nTheir first album was \"Portrait of an American Family\", which was released in 1993.\nSome of their greatest hits are \"The Beautiful People\", \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\", \"The Dope Show\", \"Disposable Teens\", \"Tainted Love\", and \"Personal Jesus\".\nMarilyn Manson's songs about drugs, violence and anti-Christianity caused a lot of trouble, especially among Christians. There were protests at his concerts and they were not allowed to play in some cities.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Marilyn_Manson_(musician)","surface_form":"lead singer of the group","offset":69},{"uri":"Marilyn_Monroe","surface_form":"Marilyn Monroe","offset":175},{"uri":"Charles_Manson","surface_form":"Charles Manson","offset":241},{"uri":"Florida","surface_form":"Florida","offset":609},{"uri":"Ohio","surface_form":"Ohio","offset":651},{"uri":"Trent_Reznor","surface_form":"Trent Reznor","offset":724},{"uri":"Nine_Inch_Nails","surface_form":"Nine Inch Nails","offset":754},{"uri":"Portrait_of_an_American_Family","surface_form":"Portrait of an American Family","offset":1230},{"uri":"Christians","surface_form":"Christians","offset":1566}]}
