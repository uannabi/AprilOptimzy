{"id":90999,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand%27Anse_(department)","text":"Grand'Anse, or \"Grande Anse\", is one of the ten departments (French: \"d\u00E9partments\", singular \"d\u00E9partment\") of Haiti. Its capital is J\u00E9r\u00E9mie.\nGeography.\nThe \"D\u00E9partment de la Grand'Anse\" has an area of 2,091 km\u00B2. It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Gon\u00E2ve, to the east by the Nippes Department, to the south by the Sud Department, and by the Caribbean Sea to the west.\nThe \"Massiff de la Hotte\", an important Haitian mountain range, runs from west to east along the south of the department, with the Plymouth, Macaya and Casetaches mountain ranges. Because of this, rivers here are short; some of them are Barad\u00E8res, Dame-Marie, de la Grande-Anse, de Nippes, des Roseaux and Voldrogue.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"departments","offset":48},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":61},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":110},{"uri":"J%C3%A9r%C3%A9mie","surface_form":"J\u00E9r\u00E9mie","offset":132},{"uri":"Square_kilometre","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":207},{"uri":"Gulf_of_Gon%C3%A2ve","surface_form":"Gulf of Gon\u00E2ve","offset":247},{"uri":"Nippes_Department","surface_form":"Nippes Department","offset":282},{"uri":"Sud_Department","surface_form":"Sud Department","offset":321},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":348},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":538}]}
