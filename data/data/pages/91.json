{"id":91,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry","text":"The word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that have many seeds and can be used as food. Some examples are raspberry, strawberry, lingonberry and blueberry.\nWhen botanists talk about \"berries\", they mean a simple fruit produced from a single ovary. They sometimes call this \"true berry\", to distinguish it from \"false berries\". By that statement of how words are used, grapes or tomatoes are true berries.\nThe berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the pericarp which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have an upper ovary with one or more carpels. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary.\nBerries are small, sweet, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds.\nSome fruits that are called \"berries\" in English are not \"true berries\" by the use of words above. These include raspberries, strawberry, blackberries, cranberries, and boysenberries. Some true berries do not have \"berry\" in their name. These include tomatoes, bananas, eggplants, guavas, pomegranates and chillies. Pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, oranges and lemons are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names (pepo for pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons, or hesperidium for oranges and lemons).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":57},{"uri":"Seeds","surface_form":"seeds","offset":79},{"uri":"Raspberry","surface_form":"raspberry","offset":128},{"uri":"Strawberry","surface_form":"strawberry","offset":139},{"uri":"Lingonberry","surface_form":"lingonberry","offset":151},{"uri":"Blueberry","surface_form":"blueberry","offset":167},{"uri":"Botany","surface_form":"botanists","offset":183},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":234},{"uri":"Gynoecium","surface_form":"ovary","offset":263},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":390},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":400},{"uri":"Pericarp","surface_form":"pericarp","offset":552},{"uri":"Carpel","surface_form":"carpel","offset":654},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":802},{"uri":"Seed","surface_form":"seed","offset":840},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":888},{"uri":"Raspberry","surface_form":"raspberries","offset":960},{"uri":"Blackberry","surface_form":"blackberries","offset":985},{"uri":"Cranberry","surface_form":"cranberries","offset":999},{"uri":"Boysenberry","surface_form":"boysenberries","offset":1016},{"uri":"Tomato","surface_form":"tomato","offset":1098},{"uri":"Banana","surface_form":"banana","offset":1108},{"uri":"Eggplant","surface_form":"eggplant","offset":1117},{"uri":"Guava","surface_form":"guava","offset":1128},{"uri":"Pomegranate","surface_form":"pomegranate","offset":1136},{"uri":"Chile_pepper","surface_form":"chillies","offset":1153},{"uri":"Pumpkin","surface_form":"Pumpkin","offset":1163},{"uri":"Cucumber","surface_form":"cucumber","offset":1173},{"uri":"Melon","surface_form":"melon","offset":1184},{"uri":"Orange_(fruit)","surface_form":"oranges","offset":1192},{"uri":"Lemon","surface_form":"lemon","offset":1204},{"uri":"Pepo","surface_form":"pepo","offset":1305},{"uri":"Hesperidium","surface_form":"hesperidium","offset":1350}]}
