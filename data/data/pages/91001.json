She is famous for being the lead vocalist of the C-Pop band Nan Quan Mama. The band's first album \"Treasure Map\" and second album \"Nan Quan Mama, Version 2\" both peaked at #4 on the Taiwanese Album Charts. She has also appeared as a featured voicalist on Jay Chou's sixth album \"November's Chopin\" on the track \"Coral Sea\".\nBiography.\nVeronin was born and raised in Monterey Park, California, America and moved to Taiwan in her teens. Her father is a Russian American, and her mother a Taiwanese. She speaks fluent English and Mandarin as shown in her songs, but says she is unable to speak Russian.\nReportedly, Veronin's talent was discovered when she met C-pop singer Jay Chou at a restaurant where she was working. He was interested in her voice and recruited her for his band, Nan Quan Mama. Her role as the lead singer of Nan Quan Mama gave her instant fame.\nShe gained greater recognition as her songs \"\u9760\u8FD1\u4E00\u9EDE\u9EDE Kao Jin Yi Dian Dian\" and \"Say You Love Me\" were chosen to be theme songs for It Started With A Kiss, a Chinese romantic comedy television series in 2005.\nIn 2006, Veronin was cast in the television series \"Engagement for Love\", co-starring Alex To and Ambrose Hsu.\nAs of now, Veronin is studying in college in Taipei while continuing her music career.\nStyle.\nHer musical style is often disputed (argued about). This is because most of her songs when she performs solo are in the alternative or pop-rock genre, but when she performs as a vocalist in the band Nan Quan Mama, she often sings blues- and soul-influenced dance music.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Russia","surface_form":"Russia","offset":18},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":26},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":36},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":45},{"uri":"2_May","surface_form":"2 May","offset":60},{"uri":"1988","surface_form":"1988","offset":66},{"uri":"Voice","surface_form":"vocalist","offset":105},{"uri":"C-Pop","surface_form":"C-Pop","offset":121},{"uri":"Nan_Quan_Mama","surface_form":"Nan Quan Mama","offset":132},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":164},{"uri":"Jay_Chou","surface_form":"Jay Chou","offset":327},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"track","offset":377},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":453},{"uri":"USA","surface_form":"America","offset":465},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":486},{"uri":"Teenage","surface_form":"teens","offset":500},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":587},{"uri":"Mandarin_language","surface_form":"Mandarin","offset":599},{"uri":"Russian_language","surface_form":"Russian","offset":663},{"uri":"Talent","surface_form":"talent","offset":694},{"uri":"C-pop","surface_form":"C-pop","offset":729},{"uri":"Jay_Chou","surface_form":"Jay Chou","offset":742},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":756},{"uri":"It_Started_With_A_Kiss","surface_form":"It Started With A Kiss","offset":1065},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":1091},{"uri":"Romantic_comedy","surface_form":"romantic comedy","offset":1099},{"uri":"Television_programme","surface_form":"television series","offset":1115},{"uri":"2005","surface_form":"2005","offset":1136},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1145},{"uri":"Engagement_for_Love","surface_form":"Engagement for Love","offset":1194},{"uri":"Alex_To","surface_form":"Alex To","offset":1228},{"uri":"Ambrose_Hsu","surface_form":"Ambrose Hsu","offset":1240},{"uri":"Education","surface_form":"study","offset":1275},{"uri":"College","surface_form":"college","offset":1287},{"uri":"Taipei","surface_form":"Taipei","offset":1298},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":1326},{"uri":"Career","surface_form":"career","offset":1332},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":1351},{"uri":"Style","surface_form":"style","offset":1359},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":1427},{"uri":"Alternative_rock","surface_form":"alternative","offset":1467},{"uri":"Pop_music","surface_form":"pop","offset":1482},{"uri":"Rock_music","surface_form":"rock","offset":1486},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":1577},{"uri":"Soul_music","surface_form":"soul","offset":1588},{"uri":"Dance_music","surface_form":"dance music","offset":1604}]}
