Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album.\nHe died in 1966 of an accidental morphine overdose whist on trial.\nIn 1970 the New York's highest court of appeals decided that he is \"not guilty for using bad words\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":56},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"comedian","offset":65},{"uri":"Stand-up_comedy","surface_form":"stand-up comedy","offset":159},{"uri":"First_Amendment","surface_form":"First Amendment","offset":380},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":410},{"uri":"Free_speech","surface_form":"free speech","offset":440},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":460},{"uri":"The_Beatles","surface_form":"The Beatles","offset":642},{"uri":"Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band","surface_form":"Sgt.
