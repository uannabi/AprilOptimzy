{"id":91042,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International","text":"The Socialist International (SI) is a worldwide group which wants to establish democratic socialism. Most of its members are democratic socialist, social democratic, and labour political parties.\nHistory.\nIts name is from the Second International, which was formed in 1889 and dissolved on the eve of World War I in 1914.\nSome of the Second International's most famous actions were its 1889 declaration of 1 May as International Labour Day and its 1910 declaration of 8 March as International Women's Day. The Second International was split by the outbreak of World War I. A small part carried on as the International Socialist Commission. The International re-formed in 1923 (as the Labour and Socialist International), and was re organised again, in its present form, after World War II. Many social democratic and socialist parties had been suppressed in Nazi-occupied Europe.\nSince World War II, the SI helped social democratic parties to re-start themselves when dictatorship gave way to democracy in Portugal (1974) and Spain (1975).\nUntil its 1976 Geneva Congress, the Socialist International had few members outside Europe and no formal involvement with Latin America. In the 1980s, most SI parties gave their backing to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas (FSLN), whose left-wing government had incited hatred from the United States. Since then, the SI has admitted as member-parties not only the FSLN but also the centre-left Puerto Rican Independence Party, as well as the ex-Communist parties such as the Italian Democrats of the Left (Democratici di Sinistra (DS)) and the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO).\nThe Party of European Socialists, a European political party active in the European Parliament, is an associated organisation of the Socialist International.\nPresidents.\nIn 2006, George Papandreou, leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, became the president of the Socialist International.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["organization"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Democratic_socialism","surface_form":"democratic socialism","offset":79},{"uri":"Social_democracy","surface_form":"social democratic","offset":147},{"uri":"Labour_party","surface_form":"labour","offset":170},{"uri":"Second_International","surface_form":"Second International","offset":226},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":301},{"uri":"Labour_Day","surface_form":"Labour Day","offset":429},{"uri":"Women%27s_Day","surface_form":"Women's Day","offset":493},{"uri":"International_Socialist_Commission","surface_form":"International Socialist Commission","offset":604},{"uri":"Labour_and_Socialist_International","surface_form":"Labour and Socialist International","offset":684},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":776},{"uri":"Socialism","surface_form":"socialist","offset":817},{"uri":"Nazi","surface_form":"Nazi","offset":858},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":872},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":886},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":1006},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1026},{"uri":"Geneva_City","surface_form":"Geneva","offset":1055},{"uri":"Latin_America","surface_form":"Latin America","offset":1162},{"uri":"Nicaragua","surface_form":"Nicaragua","offset":1233},{"uri":"Sandinista","surface_form":"Sandinista","offset":1244},{"uri":"Left-wing","surface_form":"left-wing","offset":1270},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1319},{"uri":"Centre-left","surface_form":"centre-left","offset":1415},{"uri":"Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party","surface_form":"Puerto Rican Independence Party","offset":1427},{"uri":"Communist","surface_form":"Communist","offset":1478},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":1508},{"uri":"Democrats_of_the_Left","surface_form":"Democrats of the Left","offset":1516},{"uri":"Mozambican_Liberation_Front","surface_form":"Front for the Liberation of Mozambique","offset":1577},{"uri":"Party_of_European_Socialists","surface_form":"Party of European Socialists","offset":1631},{"uri":"European_political_party","surface_form":"European political party","offset":1663},{"uri":"European_Parliament","surface_form":"European Parliament","offset":1702},{"uri":"George_Andreas_Papandreou","surface_form":"George Papandreou","offset":1806},{"uri":"Panhellenic_Socialist_Movement","surface_form":"Panhellenic Socialist Movement","offset":1839}]}
