{"id":91091,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Department","text":"Nord (English: \"North\") is one of the ten departments (French: \"d\u00E9partments\", singular \"d\u00E9partment\") of Haiti. After the Haitian Revolution, the country was divided into only three departments: Nord, Ouest and Sud. The Nord-Est and Nord-Ouest departments were part of the Nord department.\nIts capital and largest city is Cap-Ha\u00EFtien, founded in 1670 by Bertrand d'Orgeron and the old capital city of \"Saint-Domingue\". It had the nickname of \"Paris of Saint-Domingue\".\nGeography.\nThe \"D\u00E9partment du Nord\" has an area of 2,106 km\u00B2. It is bordered to the northwest by the Nord-Ouest Department, to the east by the Nord-Est Department, to the southeast by the Centre Department and to the west by the Artibonite Department. The Atlantic Ocean is to the north.\nThe main rivers of the department are Grande Rivi\u00E8re du Nord, Haut du Cap and Limb\u00E9. The rivers Trois-Rivi\u00E8res and Bouyaha have their sources in this department. All these rivers, except Bouyaha that is a tributary of the river Artibonite, flow to the north, into the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe \"Massif du Nord\" mountain range, known in the Dominican Republic as \"Cordillera Central\", runs from the northwest to the southeast along the southern half of the department. This Massif du Nord is formed by several chains and the most important, in this department, are the \"Chaine de la Grande Rivi\u00E8re du Nord\" and the 'Chaine de Saint Raphael\".\nThe \"Pleine du Nord\" (in English, \"Northern Plain\") is in the northern half of the department.\nPopulation.\nThe department had, in the 2003 census, a population of 823,043 persons: 393,547 men and 429,496 women, with 325,318 (39.53%) living in cities and towns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":6},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"departments","offset":42},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":55},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":104},{"uri":"Cap-Ha%C3%AFtien","surface_form":"Cap-Ha\u00EFtien","offset":321},{"uri":"Nickname","surface_form":"nickname","offset":429},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":442},{"uri":"Square_kilometre","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":525},{"uri":"Nord-Ouest_Department","surface_form":"Nord-Ouest Department","offset":569},{"uri":"Nord-Est_Department","surface_form":"Nord-Est Department","offset":611},{"uri":"Centre_Department","surface_form":"Centre Department","offset":656},{"uri":"Artibonite_Department","surface_form":"Artibonite Department","offset":697},{"uri":"Atlantic_Ocean","surface_form":"Atlantic Ocean","offset":724},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"sources","offset":890},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":961},{"uri":"Artibonite_River","surface_form":"Artibonite","offset":984},{"uri":"Mountain_range","surface_form":"mountain range","offset":1061},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":1090},{"uri":"Plain","surface_form":"Plain","offset":1435}]}
