{"id":911,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word","text":"A word is something spoken by the mouth, that can be pronounced. In alphabetic writing, it is a collection of letters used together to communicate a meaning. These can also usually be pronounced. A logogram is also a word.\nSome words have more than one meaning, for example 'spring' can refer to the season, the device, or a conjugation of the verb. These are homonyms. Some words have different pronunciation, for example, 'wind' (the noun) and 'wind' (the verb) are pronounced differently.\nSome words have different spelling for example 'color' and 'colour', which are both correct. Color is used in American English and colour is used in British English. Some words can be only one letter, for example \"a\" and \"I\" in English. Besides English, other languages have their own words. When written with an alphabet, words are usually separated by a space. When written with ideogram<nowiki/>s, each word is usually a separate symbol.\nWords can be invented. This is called neologism. For example, radar was originally an acronym but became an actual word. Two words may be joined to make a compound word.\nFuller definition.\nA word is the smallest thing which can be said \"with meaning\". For example, \"hello\" is a word.\nThis contrasts with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but may not stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\"), or several (\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just given, these are \"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\").\nThe meaning of a word can be found in a dictionary.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Mouth","surface_form":"mouth","offset":34},{"uri":"Alphabet","surface_form":"alphabet","offset":68},{"uri":"Letter","surface_form":"letter","offset":110},{"uri":"Logogram","surface_form":"logogram","offset":198},{"uri":"Meaning","surface_form":"meaning","offset":253},{"uri":"Spring_(device)","surface_form":"device","offset":312},{"uri":"Conjugation","surface_form":"conjugation","offset":325},{"uri":"Homonym","surface_form":"homonym","offset":360},{"uri":"Pronunciation","surface_form":"pronunciation","offset":396},{"uri":"Spelling","surface_form":"spelling","offset":518},{"uri":"American_English","surface_form":"American English","offset":602},{"uri":"British_English","surface_form":"British English","offset":641},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":720},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":752},{"uri":"Ideogram","surface_form":"ideogram","offset":873},{"uri":"Neologism","surface_form":"neologism","offset":971},{"uri":"Radar","surface_form":"radar","offset":995},{"uri":"Acronym","surface_form":"acronym","offset":1019},{"uri":"Compound_word","surface_form":"compound word","offset":1088},{"uri":"Hello","surface_form":"hello","offset":1199},{"uri":"Morpheme","surface_form":"morpheme","offset":1239},{"uri":"Dictionary","surface_form":"dictionary","offset":1647}]}
