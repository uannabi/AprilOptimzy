Its capital is Les Cayes.\nGeography.\nThe \"D\u00E9partment du Sud\" has an area of 2,794 km\u00B2. It is bordered to the north by the Grand'Anse and Nippes departments, to the east by the Sud-Est Department and by the Caribbean Sea to the west and south.\nThe \"Massiff de la Hotte\", an important Haitian mountain range, runs from west to east along the centre of the department. Because of this, rivers here are short; some of them are Acul du Sud, Torbeck, Ravine du Sud, de l'Ilet, Cavaillon, des Anglais, Port \u00E0 Piment, Saut Mathurine, de Tiburon.\nPopulation.\nThe department had, in the 2003 census, a population of 621,651 persons: 312,729 men and 308.922 women, with only 109,623 (17.63%) living in cities and towns.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":5},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"departments","offset":41},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":54},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":103},{"uri":"Les_Cayes","surface_form":"Les Cayes","offset":125},{"uri":"Square_kilometre","surface_form":"km\u00B2","offset":192},{"uri":"Grand%27Anse_Department","surface_form":"Grand'Anse","offset":232},{"uri":"Nippes_Department","surface_form":"Nippes","offset":247},{"uri":"Sud-Est_Department","surface_form":"Sud-Est Department","offset":286},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":316}]}
