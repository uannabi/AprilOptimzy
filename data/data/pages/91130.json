{"id":91130,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker","text":"John Lee Hooker (August 22, 1917 \u2013 June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter born in Coahoma County near Clarksdale, Mississippi.\nEarly life.\nHooker was born on August 22, 1917 in Coahoma County near Clarksdale, Mississippi. He was born to William Hooker and Minnie Ramsey and was the youngest of eleven children. He and his siblings were home-schooled and they were only allowed to listen to religious songs. His parents separated in 1921 and his mother married William Moore, a blues singer the next year. Moore introduced Hooker to the guitar. John would later credit Moore for his distinctive playing style.\nLater life.\nAll through the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis where he worked on Beale Street and sometimes performed at house parties. In 1948, he started working at Ford Motor Company.\nCareer.\nHooker's early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. John Lee Hooker rarely played on a standard beat, changing tempos to fit the songs. This made it nearly impossible to add backing tracks.\nPop culture.\nHooker appeared and sang in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\". He recorded over 100 albums.\nIn 1989, he played with Keith Richards, Carlos Santana and Bonnie Raitt to record \"The Healer\" and won a Grammy Award. Hooker recorded lots of songs with Van Morrison, including \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\", \"The Healing Game\" and \"I Cover the Waterfront\".\nDeath.\nHe fell ill just before a tour of Europe in 2001 and died soon afterwards at the age of 83. The last song Hooker recorded before his death, is \"Ali D'Oro\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":57},{"uri":"Blues","surface_form":"blues","offset":66},{"uri":"Guitar","surface_form":"guitar","offset":80},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":95},{"uri":"Coahoma_County%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Coahoma County","offset":114},{"uri":"Clarksdale%2C_Mississippi","surface_form":"Clarksdale","offset":134},{"uri":"Mississippi","surface_form":"Mississippi","offset":146},{"uri":"August_22","surface_form":"August 22","offset":190},{"uri":"1917","surface_form":"1917","offset":201},{"uri":"Coahoma_County","surface_form":"Coahoma County","offset":209},{"uri":"Clarksdale","surface_form":"Clarksdale","offset":229},{"uri":"Memphis%2C_Tennessee","surface_form":"Memphis","offset":692},{"uri":"Beale_Street","surface_form":"Beale Street","offset":719},{"uri":"Ford_Motor_Company","surface_form":"Ford Motor Company","offset":805},{"uri":"Solo_(music)","surface_form":"solo","offset":848},{"uri":"Bernie_Besman","surface_form":"Bernie Besman","offset":876},{"uri":"Tempo","surface_form":"tempo","offset":950},{"uri":"The_Blues_Brothers","surface_form":"The Blues Brothers","offset":1086},{"uri":"Keith_Richards","surface_form":"Keith Richards","offset":1160},{"uri":"Carlos_Santana","surface_form":"Carlos Santana","offset":1176},{"uri":"Bonnie_Raitt","surface_form":"Bonnie Raitt","offset":1195},{"uri":"The_Healer_(album)","surface_form":"The Healer","offset":1219},{"uri":"Grammy_Award","surface_form":"Grammy Award","offset":1241},{"uri":"Van_Morrison","surface_form":"Van Morrison","offset":1290},{"uri":"Ill","surface_form":"ill","offset":1416},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":1442}]}
