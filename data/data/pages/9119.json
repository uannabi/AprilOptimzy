{"id":9119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis","text":"=\"preserve\">Silicosis is a disease that is caused by small particles of silica (glass) getting trapped in the lungs. When people have silicosis, the changes in their body often are cyanosis (when skin goes a blueish color), a fever, when the body gets hotter or being not able to breathe properly. Sometimes doctors do not realize that someone has silicosis, and think that they have other illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis or fluid in the lungs.\nIt was first noticed in 1705 by \"Bernardino Ramazzini\" (an Italian doctor). He saw something that looked like sand in the lungs of stonecutters. The name silicosis is from Visconti in 1870. The name comes from the Latin \"silex\" which means flint.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Disease","surface_form":"disease","offset":27},{"uri":"Particle","surface_form":"particle","offset":59},{"uri":"Silica","surface_form":"silica","offset":72},{"uri":"Glass","surface_form":"glass","offset":80},{"uri":"Lung","surface_form":"lung","offset":110},{"uri":"Skin","surface_form":"skin","offset":196},{"uri":"Fever","surface_form":"fever","offset":226},{"uri":"Pneumonia","surface_form":"pneumonia","offset":405},{"uri":"Tuberculosis","surface_form":"tuberculosis","offset":416},{"uri":"Fluid","surface_form":"fluid","offset":432},{"uri":"Lungs","surface_form":"lungs","offset":445},{"uri":"Flint","surface_form":"flint","offset":692}]}
