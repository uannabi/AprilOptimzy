{"id":91233,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_pogrom","text":"The Istanbul Pogrom was a pogrom directed primarily against the Istanbul's Greek minority on September 6 and 7, 1955. Jews and Armenians living in the city and their businesses were also targeted in the pogrom, which was, according to some circles, orchestrated by the Turkish government.\nA Turkish mob, most of which was trucked into the city in advance, assaulted Istanbul\u2019s Greek community for nine hours. Although the leaders of the pogrom did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, between 13 and 16 Greeks (including two Orthodox clerics) and at least one Armenian died during or after the pogrom as a result of beatings and arson.\nThirty-two Greeks were severely wounded. In addition, dozens of Greek women were raped, and a number of men were forcibly circumcised by the mob. 4,348 Greek-owned businesses, 110 hotels, 27 pharmacies, 23 schools, 21 factories, 73 churches and over a thousand Greek-owned homes were badly damaged or destroyed.\nEstimates of the economic cost of the damage vary from Turkish government's estimate of 24.8 million US$, the British diplomat estimates of 100 million GBP (about 200 million US$), the World Council of Churches\u2019 estimate of 150 million USD, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million US$.\nThe pogrom greatly accelerated emigration of ethnic Greeks from the Istanbul region, reducing the 200,000-strong Greek minority in 1924 to just 2,500 in 2006.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pogrom","surface_form":"pogrom","offset":26},{"uri":"Istanbul","surface_form":"Istanbul","offset":64},{"uri":"Greeks","surface_form":"Greek","offset":75},{"uri":"Minority","surface_form":"minority","offset":81},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":118},{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenians","offset":127},{"uri":"Turkish_government","surface_form":"Turkish government","offset":269},{"uri":"Turkish_people","surface_form":"Turkish","offset":291},{"uri":"Eastern_Orthodoxy","surface_form":"Orthodox","offset":533},{"uri":"Clerics","surface_form":"clerics","offset":542},{"uri":"Armenians","surface_form":"Armenian","offset":568},{"uri":"Arson","surface_form":"arson","offset":637},{"uri":"Circumcision","surface_form":"circumcised","offset":766},{"uri":"US%24","surface_form":"US$","offset":1057},{"uri":"GBP","surface_form":"GBP","offset":1108},{"uri":"US%24","surface_form":"US$","offset":1131},{"uri":"World_Council_of_Churches","surface_form":"World Council of Churches","offset":1141},{"uri":"USD","surface_form":"USD","offset":1192},{"uri":"US%24","surface_form":"US$","offset":1248},{"uri":"Emigration","surface_form":"emigration","offset":1284}]}
