{"id":91286,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer","text":"e=\"preserve\">Cervical cancer is cancer of the cervix (the organ that connects the uterus and the vagina). It is caused by a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). It is a serious medical problem and sometimes causes malignance and death.\nOne sign of cervical cancer is bleeding or discharge from the vagina. Sometimes, there are no symptoms until the cancer is very developed. For this reason, pap smears have become common to diagnose this cancer. They have cut the rate of cervical cancer in half.\nFor early cervical cancer, surgery is the first treatment. For cancer that is farther along, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used.\nMost types of cervical cancer can be prevented by a vaccine. It prevents the types of HPV that cause 70% of cervical cancer. Experts recommend that women get the vaccine and normal pap smears.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Cancer","surface_form":"cancer","offset":32},{"uri":"Cervix","surface_form":"cervix","offset":46},{"uri":"Organ","surface_form":"organ","offset":58},{"uri":"Uterus","surface_form":"uterus","offset":82},{"uri":"Vagina","surface_form":"vagina","offset":97},{"uri":"Virus","surface_form":"virus","offset":124},{"uri":"HPV_(virus)","surface_form":"human papillomavirus (HPV)","offset":137},{"uri":"Malignant","surface_form":"malignance","offset":218},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"death","offset":233},{"uri":"Blood","surface_form":"bleeding","offset":271},{"uri":"Discharge","surface_form":"discharge","offset":283},{"uri":"Symptom","surface_form":"symptom","offset":334},{"uri":"Pap_smear","surface_form":"pap smear","offset":396},{"uri":"Medical_diagnosis","surface_form":"diagnose","offset":429},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":529},{"uri":"Chemotherapy","surface_form":"chemotherapy","offset":595},{"uri":"Radiotherapy","surface_form":"radiotherapy","offset":612},{"uri":"Vaccine","surface_form":"vaccine","offset":690}]}
