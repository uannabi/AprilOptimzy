{"id":91372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_Is_the_Most_Fun_a_Girl_Can_Have_Without_Taking_Her_Clothes_Off","text":"e=\"preserve\">\"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\" is the fourth single by the rock band Panic at the Disco, from their album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\". It was released on August 7, 2006 as the fourth single, but is the third advertised single (\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage\" was not commercially released as a single).\nMusic video.\nThe music video was filmed on June 19, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. The video was shown on MTV2 on July 14, 2006. It features people with fish tanks on their heads. The video only shows the band in one scene (the paramedics are the band members), because the band felt that their looks were distracting from their music.\nThe music video starts out with a woman walking on a sidewalk. For some reason, she has a fishtank on her head and all the people around her also have a fishtank. She quickly runs into a puddle and follows it to find a fish flapping around. She places it into her tank and stares at it. Then the woman heads over to a group of people to discover them gathered around a man who's tank broke and he is dying now. The woman has flashbacks to show that the man is her husband. She then attempts suicide by pouring out her own tank and collapsing. The band arrives in two ambulances (labeled Receiving Hospital) and takes them away in bathtubs. The band then carries the two across a beach and throws them into the ocean. There the woman holds the man.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Single_(music)","surface_form":"single","offset":98},{"uri":"Rock_band","surface_form":"rock band","offset":112},{"uri":"Panic_at_the_Disco","surface_form":"Panic at the Disco","offset":122},{"uri":"Album","surface_form":"album","offset":153},{"uri":"A_Fever_You_Can%27t_Sweat_Out","surface_form":"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out","offset":161},{"uri":"August_7","surface_form":"August 7","offset":210},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":220},{"uri":"The_Only_Difference_Between_Martyrdom_and_Suicide_Is_Press_Coverage","surface_form":"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage","offset":284},{"uri":"Music_video","surface_form":"music video","offset":414},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"filmed","offset":430},{"uri":"June_19","surface_form":"June 19","offset":440},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":449},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles, California","offset":457},{"uri":"July_14","surface_form":"July 14","offset":513},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":522},{"uri":"Head","surface_form":"head","offset":572},{"uri":"Woman","surface_form":"woman","offset":769},{"uri":"Ambulance","surface_form":"ambulance","offset":1302},{"uri":"Beach","surface_form":"beach","offset":1414},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"ocean","offset":1445}]}
