{"id":91457,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_As_014","text":"The Argus As 014 was a pulse jet engine used on the German V-1 flying bomber of World War II. This was meant to be a simple model that would have been easy to make a lot of for not very much money. The engine was made from a sheet of steel that was rolled into a tube. A shutter was placed at one of the ends of the tube, along with a fuel valve and an igniter (something that lights things on fire).\nIt was thought that this could become a good power source for some last ditch German fighters during the last few days of World War II.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pulse_jet_engine","surface_form":"pulse jet engine","offset":23},{"uri":"V-1","surface_form":"V-1","offset":59},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":80},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":523}]}
