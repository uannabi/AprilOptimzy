{"id":91502,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%2C_the_Black_Prince","text":"Edward, the Black Prince (Woodstock Palace, Oxfordshire, 15 June 1330 \u2013 Westminster Palace, 8 June 1376) was the eldest son of King Edward III of England.\nEdward was born at Woodstock Palace, near Oxford. He was made Prince of Wales in 1343, and followed his father into battle against France. He became a famous soldier, helping win the Battle of Cr\u00E9cy and commanding the Battle of Poitiers. He was a founding member of the Order of the Garter. In 1361, he married his cousin, Joan of Kent. They had two sons, Edward and Richard. The older son, Edward, died when he was only six.\nEdward of Woodstock has become known in history as \"the Black Prince\", but no one is quite sure of the reason for the nickname. He died at the age of 45, and was buried at the Canterbury Cathedral. As his father was still living, he never became king himself. He asked his father to give the title Prince of Wales to his son Richard, who later became King Richard II of England..","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Oxfordshire","surface_form":"Oxfordshire","offset":44},{"uri":"Westminster","surface_form":"Westminster","offset":72},{"uri":"Edward_III_of_England","surface_form":"Edward III of England","offset":132},{"uri":"Oxford","surface_form":"Oxford","offset":197},{"uri":"Prince_of_Wales","surface_form":"Prince of Wales","offset":217},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":286},{"uri":"Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy","surface_form":"Battle of Cr\u00E9cy","offset":338},{"uri":"Battle_of_Poitiers_(1356)","surface_form":"Battle of Poitiers","offset":373},{"uri":"Order_of_the_Garter","surface_form":"Order of the Garter","offset":425},{"uri":"Joan_of_Kent","surface_form":"Joan of Kent","offset":478},{"uri":"Richard_II_of_England","surface_form":"Richard","offset":522},{"uri":"Canterbury_Cathedral","surface_form":"Canterbury Cathedral","offset":757},{"uri":"Richard_II_of_England","surface_form":"Richard II of England","offset":937}]}
