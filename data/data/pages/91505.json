Charles IV the last French king of the old Capetian line. He was crowned King of France in 1322 at the cathedral in Reims.\nDuring his six years as king Charles IV raised taxes and took away land from people he did not like. In 1323 he made the Jews leave France because people thought they made secret plans with lepers and Muslims, although they did not really do those things.\nCharles died without a son so there were questions about who would be the next king. He had two daughters, but the Salic law said daughters could not rule.\nEdward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France, that was the beginning of the Hundred Years' War.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":64},{"uri":"Navarre","surface_form":"Navarre","offset":75},{"uri":"Count_of_Champagne","surface_form":"Count of Champagne","offset":102},{"uri":"House_of_Capet","surface_form":"Capetian line","offset":188},{"uri":"Cathedral","surface_form":"cathedral","offset":248},{"uri":"Reims","surface_form":"Reims","offset":261},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":315},{"uri":"Judaism","surface_form":"Jews","offset":389},{"uri":"Leprosy","surface_form":"lepers","offset":458},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":469},{"uri":"Salic_law","surface_form":"Salic law","offset":639},{"uri":"Edward_III_of_England","surface_form":"Edward III of England","offset":680},{"uri":"Hundred_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Hundred Years' War","offset":797}]}
