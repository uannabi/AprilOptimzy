She has placed the Caucasian Albania in territory of present Republic Armenia: all the territories, churches and monasteries in Republic Armenia have appeared Albanian\". He describes Mammadova's theories as \"an improved version of what became a very rough tool in Azerbaijan\".\nAnd, it is known, that on whole planet exactly the Armenian people is distinguished by the absence of spiritual and other human values.\nIn the world there are only two nations that have national identity, but have not statehood.
