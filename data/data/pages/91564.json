{"id":91564,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi","text":"Al-Ib\u0101dhiyyah (Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0636\u064A\u0629) is a denomination of Islam. It is the dominant form of Islam in only one country, Oman. There are also Ibadis in Algeria as well as Libya. It is probably one of the earliest schools, founded less than 50 years after the death of Muhammad.<nowiki/>\nThe name is from \u02E4Abdull\u0101h ibn-Ib\u0101\u1E0D at-Tam\u012Bm\u012B. Some followers of this branch, however, claim its true founder was Jabir ibn Zaid al-'Azdi from Nizwa, Oman.\nHow Ibadis are different.\nUnlike the Kharijites, Ib\u0101\u1E0D\u012B have abandoned the practice of assassination of mainstream Muslims.\nIb\u0101\u1E0D\u012Bs agree with Sunnis in approving of Ab\u016B Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab, whom they regard as the two rightly-guided Caliphs. They think Uthman ibn Affan has introduced \"bid\u02E4a\" \"innovations\" into Isl\u0101m. They approve of the revolt which overthrew him. They also approve of the first part of \u02E4Al\u012B's caliphate, and, like Shi'as, disapprove of \u02E4\u0100'isha's rebellion against him and also disapprove of Mu\u02E4\u0101wiyya's revolt. However, they regard \u02E4Al\u012B's acceptance of arbitration at the Battle of Siffin against Mu\u02E4\u0101wiyya's rebels as un-Islamic and as rendering him unfit for the Imamate, and they condemn \u02E4Al\u012B for killing the early Kharijites of \"an-Nahr\" in the Battle of Nahrawan.\nMain differences.\nIn their belief, the fifth legitimate Caliph was Abdullah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi. All Caliphs from Mu\u02E4\u0101wiyya onwards are regarded as tyrants except Umar ibn Abdul Aziz, on whom opinions differ. However, various later Ib\u0101\u1E0D\u012B leaders are recognized as true im\u0101ms, including Abdullah ibn Yahya al-Kindi of South Arabia and the im\u0101ms of the Rustamid dynasty in North Africa.\nIb\u0101\u1E0D\u012B Muslims are also found in Jabal Nafusa in Libya, Mzab in Algeria, East Africa (particularly Zanzibar) and Djerba Island in Tunisia. The early medieval Rustamid dynasty in Algeria was Ib\u0101\u1E0D\u012B, and refugees from its capital Tahert founded the North African Ib\u0101\u1E0D\u012B communities which exist today.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":53},{"uri":"Oman","surface_form":"Oman","offset":114},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":145},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":164},{"uri":"Muhammad","surface_form":"Muhammad","offset":261},{"uri":"Abdullah_ibn_Ibadh","surface_form":"\u02E4Abdull\u0101h ibn-Ib\u0101\u1E0D","offset":297},{"uri":"Bani_Tamim","surface_form":"at-Tam\u012Bm\u012B","offset":316},{"uri":"Nizwa%2C_Oman","surface_form":"Nizwa","offset":423},{"uri":"Assassination","surface_form":"assassination","offset":522},{"uri":"Abu_Bakr","surface_form":"Ab\u016B Bakr","offset":600},{"uri":"Umar_ibn_al-Khattab","surface_form":"Umar ibn al-Khattab","offset":613},{"uri":"Caliph","surface_form":"Caliph","offset":677},{"uri":"Uthman_ibn_Affan","surface_form":"Uthman ibn Affan","offset":697},{"uri":"Bid%27ah","surface_form":"bid\u02E4a","offset":730},{"uri":"Ali","surface_form":"\u02E4Al\u012B","offset":850},{"uri":"Aisha","surface_form":"\u02E4\u0100'isha","offset":900},{"uri":"Muawiya","surface_form":"Mu\u02E4\u0101wiyya","offset":955},{"uri":"Arbitration","surface_form":"arbitration","offset":1017},{"uri":"Battle_of_Siffin","surface_form":"Battle of Siffin","offset":1036},{"uri":"Battle_of_Nahrawan","surface_form":"Battle of Nahrawan","offset":1213},{"uri":"Caliph","surface_form":"Caliph","offset":1289},{"uri":"Abdullah_ibn_Wahb_al-Rasibi","surface_form":"Abdullah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi","offset":1300},{"uri":"Caliph","surface_form":"Caliph","offset":1333},{"uri":"Muawiya","surface_form":"Mu\u02E4\u0101wiyya","offset":1346},{"uri":"Umar_ibn_Abdul_Aziz","surface_form":"Umar ibn Abdul Aziz","offset":1395},{"uri":"Imam","surface_form":"im\u0101ms","offset":1501},{"uri":"Abdullah_ibn_Yahya_al-Kindi","surface_form":"Abdullah ibn Yahya al-Kindi","offset":1518},{"uri":"Rustamid","surface_form":"Rustamid","offset":1583},{"uri":"Jabal_Nafusa","surface_form":"Jabal Nafusa","offset":1649},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":1665},{"uri":"Mzab","surface_form":"Mzab","offset":1672},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":1680},{"uri":"East_Africa","surface_form":"East Africa","offset":1689},{"uri":"Zanzibar","surface_form":"Zanzibar","offset":1715},{"uri":"Djerba","surface_form":"Djerba Island","offset":1729},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":1746},{"uri":"Rustamid","surface_form":"Rustamid","offset":1774},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":1794},{"uri":"Tahert","surface_form":"Tahert","offset":1843}]}
