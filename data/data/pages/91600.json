{"id":91600,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamenz_(district)","text":"Kamenz () was a (rural district) in the north-east of the Free State of Saxony, Germany. The independent city Hoyerswerda is completely surrounded by the district. There was a reorganisation of districts in Saxony in July 2008, and Hoyerswerda became a part of Landkreis Kamenz instead of having a separate government.\nHistory.\nThe district was formed in 1994 from the previous Kamenz district, the northern parts of the Dresden-Land district, around Radeberg, and the Hoyerswerda district, except the town of Hoyerswerda, which became a district-free city. From 1994 to 1996 it was called \"Westlausitz - Dresdner Land\", but then renamed to \"Kamenz\" again.\nPartnerships.\nSince December 14, 1990 the district has been a twin town of the district Alzey-Worms in Rhineland-Palatinate.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Free_State_of_Saxony","surface_form":"Free State of Saxony","offset":58},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":80},{"uri":"Hoyerswerda","surface_form":"Hoyerswerda","offset":110},{"uri":"Radeberg","surface_form":"Radeberg","offset":451},{"uri":"Hoyerswerda","surface_form":"Hoyerswerda","offset":510},{"uri":"December_14","surface_form":"December 14","offset":677},{"uri":"1990","surface_form":"1990","offset":690},{"uri":"Twin_town","surface_form":"twin town","offset":719},{"uri":"Alzey-Worms","surface_form":"Alzey-Worms","offset":745},{"uri":"Rhineland-Palatinate","surface_form":"Rhineland-Palatinate","offset":760}]}
