Bornholm is a Danish island.\nThe island is a popular holiday resort for Scandinavians, Germans and Poles. Many yachters come here in the summer.\nAt the end of World War II, the island was \"liberated\" by the Soviet red army, and held for several months after the German surrender. The island lies far east of the demarcation line between the allied forces in Europe. For some time the Soviet presence looked like an occupation. It was not until April 5th, 1946 that the island at last was free.\nBut then the Danish government took over and the island is today a Danish colony.
