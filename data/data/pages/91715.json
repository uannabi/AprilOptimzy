{"id":91715,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Valois","text":"The House of Valois was a younger branch of the Capetian dynasty that ruled France in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance from 1328 to 1529. The kings of the House of Valois were descended\nfrom Charles of Valois who was the third son of Philip III of France. They claimed the Salic law put them ahead of Edward III of England to rule France. Edward III of England thought he had gotten the right to the French crown through his mother. The two countries fought the Hundred Years' War because of that disagreement.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Capetian_dynasty","surface_form":"Capetian dynasty","offset":48},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":76},{"uri":"Middle_Ages","surface_form":"Middle Ages","offset":95},{"uri":"Renaissance","surface_form":"Renaissance","offset":115},{"uri":"1328","surface_form":"1328","offset":132},{"uri":"1529","surface_form":"1529","offset":140},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":150},{"uri":"Charles_of_Valois","surface_form":"Charles of Valois","offset":199},{"uri":"Philip_III_of_France","surface_form":"Philip III of France","offset":242},{"uri":"Salic_law","surface_form":"Salic law","offset":281},{"uri":"Edward_III_of_England","surface_form":"Edward III of England","offset":309},{"uri":"Crown","surface_form":"crown","offset":415},{"uri":"Hundred_Years%27_War","surface_form":"Hundred Years' War","offset":470}]}
