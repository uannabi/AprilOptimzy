The independent city of Zwickau is in the middle of the district. It is nearly completely surrounded by the district. In July 2008, the city lost its right to administer itself, and become a city under the control of the district government.\nThe rural district was created on 1 August 1994. Its capital is Werdau. On January 1, 1999, the district was reorganised. Cainsdorf, Mosel, Oberrothenbach and Schlunzig were made a part of to Zwickau even though the people living in those towns wanted to stay independent.\nGeography.\nThe district is located in the Ore Mountains (\"Erzgebirge\"), with the main rivers being the \"Zwickauer Mulde\" and the \"Plei\u00DFe\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["German District|"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Landkreis","surface_form":"Landkreis","offset":21},{"uri":"Districts_in_Saxony","surface_form":"district","offset":38},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Free State of Saxony","offset":73},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":95},{"uri":"City","surface_form":"city","offset":120},{"uri":"Zwickau","surface_form":"Zwickau","offset":128},{"uri":"Administration","surface_form":"administer","offset":263},{"uri":"Government","surface_form":"government","offset":334},{"uri":"1_August","surface_form":"1 August","offset":380},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":389},{"uri":"Capital_(city)","surface_form":"capital","offset":399},{"uri":"Werdau","surface_form":"Werdau","offset":410},{"uri":"January_1","surface_form":"January 1","offset":421},{"uri":"1999","surface_form":"1999","offset":432},{"uri":"Cainsdorf","surface_form":"Cainsdorf","offset":468},{"uri":"Mosel","surface_form":"Mosel","offset":479},{"uri":"Oberrothenbach","surface_form":"Oberrothenbach","offset":486},{"uri":"Schlunzig","surface_form":"Schlunzig","offset":505},{"uri":"Ore_Mountains_(Germany)","surface_form":"Ore Mountains","offset":661},{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":705}]}
