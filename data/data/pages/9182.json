{"id":9182,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Tim","text":"Herbert Buckingham Khaury, better known as Tiny Tim (April 12, 1932\u2013November 30, 1996), was an American singer and musician. He became popular in the late 1960s due to his appearances on television, and songs played on ukulele with a falsetto voice. His most famous song was \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\". His best-remembered television appearances were on \"Laugh-In\" and \"The Tonight Show\". His first wedding took place on \"The Tonight Show\" in 1969, at host Johnny Carson's suggestion.\nCareer.\nNot just a performer, he was also an expert, who studied American music from the earliest days of the United States, and performed many historic songs in his act. Over time, he used his falsetto voice less, and performed most songs in his natural, baritone voice.\nWhen his popularity as a \" lessened, he performed in small nightclubs and other places, as he had earlier. During the 1980s, he toured with a circus, and appeared in a movie as a circus performer who turned to crime. In the 1990s, he recorded new music (including a Christmas album), and joined comedian Pat Paulsen in his latest mock campaign to become President of the United States, as Paulsen's.\nPersonal life.\nMarried three times, his last wife was a former fan, who met him when she made a documentary about his life and career. One of his later supporters was radio talk show host Howard Stern. Tiny Tim died in 1996, after suffering a heart attack during a performance.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"April_12","surface_form":"April 12","offset":53},{"uri":"1932","surface_form":"1932","offset":63},{"uri":"November_30","surface_form":"November 30","offset":68},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":81},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":95},{"uri":"Singer","surface_form":"singer","offset":104},{"uri":"Musician","surface_form":"musician","offset":115},{"uri":"Popular","surface_form":"popular","offset":135},{"uri":"1960s","surface_form":"1960s","offset":155},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":187},{"uri":"Ukulele","surface_form":"ukulele","offset":219},{"uri":"Falsetto","surface_form":"falsetto","offset":234},{"uri":"Rowan_%26amp%3B_Martin%27s_Laugh-In","surface_form":"Laugh-In","offset":356},{"uri":"The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson","surface_form":"The Tonight Show","offset":371},{"uri":"Wedding","surface_form":"wedding","offset":400},{"uri":"Television_host","surface_form":"host","offset":453},{"uri":"Johnny_Carson","surface_form":"Johnny Carson","offset":458},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":596},{"uri":"Baritone","surface_form":"baritone","offset":742},{"uri":"Nightclub","surface_form":"nightclub","offset":817},{"uri":"Circus","surface_form":"circus","offset":900},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":926},{"uri":"Crime","surface_form":"crime","offset":968},{"uri":"Christmas","surface_form":"Christmas","offset":1024},{"uri":"Album_(music)","surface_form":"album","offset":1034},{"uri":"Comedian","surface_form":"comedian","offset":1053},{"uri":"Pat_Paulsen","surface_form":"Pat Paulsen","offset":1062},{"uri":"Campaign","surface_form":"campaign","offset":1093},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"President","offset":1112},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1129},{"uri":"Documentary","surface_form":"documentary","offset":1254},{"uri":"Radio","surface_form":"radio","offset":1325},{"uri":"Talk_show","surface_form":"talk show","offset":1331},{"uri":"Howard_Stern","surface_form":"Howard Stern","offset":1346},{"uri":"Heart_attack","surface_form":"heart attack","offset":1401}]}
