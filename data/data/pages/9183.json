{"id":9183,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin","text":"The Kelvin scale (symbol: K) is the SI unit of temperature. It is named in honour of the physicist William Thomson, the first Lord Kelvin (1824\u20131907).\nDefinition.\nThe Kelvin scale is defined by a specific relationship between the pressure of a gas and the temperature. This says that \"the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin\". This means that Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, and scientists use this scale more than any other.\nThe kelvin is a base SI unit of measurement, defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the temperature of the triple point of water, which is the temperature at which water in solid, liquid, and gaseous state coexist in equilibrium.\nThe temperature of the triple point of water is a hundredth of a degree Celsius above the freezing point, or 0.01\u00A0\u00B0C. The coldest possible temperature is called absolute zero and is equal to -273.15\u00A0degrees\u00A0Celsius, or zero\u00A0kelvin (0\u00A0K). By writing temperatures in kelvins one does not need to use negative numbers.\nThe absolute temperature scale was designed so that a change in temperature of 1\u00A0kelvin is equal to a change of 1\u00A0degree\u00A0Celsius. This means that it is easy to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin.\nIt is important to notice that the name of this unit is simply \"kelvin\" (with a lowercase initial), not \"degree Kelvin\". In English, it undergoes normal plural inflection as \"kelvins\". For example, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen is 77\u00A0kelvins.\nIn everyday use, the kelvin is most commonly used to measure very low or very high temperatures, such as the temperature of liquid nitrogen or the temperature of a light bulb filament.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Unit"],"annotations":[{"uri":"SI","surface_form":"SI","offset":36},{"uri":"Temperature","surface_form":"temperature","offset":47},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":89},{"uri":"William_Thomson","surface_form":"William Thomson","offset":99},{"uri":"Lord_Kelvin","surface_form":"Lord Kelvin","offset":126},{"uri":"Triple_point","surface_form":"triple point","offset":577},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"Celsius","offset":772},{"uri":"Absolute_zero","surface_form":"absolute zero","offset":861},{"uri":"Negative_number","surface_form":"negative number","offset":998},{"uri":"Absolute_temperature","surface_form":"absolute temperature","offset":1020},{"uri":"Plural","surface_form":"plural","offset":1383},{"uri":"Inflection","surface_form":"inflection","offset":1390}]}
