{"id":91849,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbian_languages","text":"The Sorbian languages are Slavic languages, a branch of the Indo-European languages.\nThey are the Sorbs' native languages, who are a Slavic minority in eastern Germany. The languages used to be known as Wendish or Lusatian'\".\nThere are two languages: Upper Sorbian (\"hornjoserbsce\"), spoken by about 40,000 people in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (\"dolnoserbski\"), spoken by about 10,000 people in Brandenburg. Both languages are spoken is an area known as Lusatia (\"\u0141u\u017Eica\" in Upper Sorbian, \"\u0141u\u017Eyca\" in Lower Sorbian and \"Lausitz\" in German).\nIn Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. In the home areas of the Sorbs, both languages are officially equal to German.\nThe city of Bautzen, Upper Lusatia, is the centre of Upper Sorbian culture. Bilingual signs can be seen around the city, including the name of the city, \"Bautzen/\"Budy\u0161in\".\nThe city of Cottbus (\"Ch\u00F3\u015Bebuz\") is considered the cultural centre of Lower Sorbian. Cottbuss also has bilingual signs.\nSorbian is also spoken in the small Sorbian (\u201CWendish\u201D) settlement of Serbin in Lee County, Texas. Until recently newspapers were published in Sorbian there. The local dialect has been heavily influenced by surrounding speakers of German and English.\nAmerican and Australian communities often prefer to call themselves \u201CWends\u201D or \u201CWendish\u201D since think that \u201CSorb\u201D and \u201CSorbian\u201D are bad words.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Slavic_languages","surface_form":"Slavic languages","offset":26},{"uri":"Indo-European_languages","surface_form":"Indo-European languages","offset":60},{"uri":"Sorbs","surface_form":"Sorbs","offset":98},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":160},{"uri":"Upper_Sorbian_language","surface_form":"Upper Sorbian","offset":251},{"uri":"Saxony","surface_form":"Saxony","offset":317},{"uri":"Brandenburg","surface_form":"Brandenburg","offset":394},{"uri":"Lusatia","surface_form":"Lusatia","offset":453},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":532},{"uri":"European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages","surface_form":"European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages","offset":646},{"uri":"Bautzen","surface_form":"Bautzen","offset":790},{"uri":"Upper_Lusatia","surface_form":"Upper Lusatia","offset":799},{"uri":"Cottbus","surface_form":"Cottbus","offset":963},{"uri":"Serbin%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Serbin","offset":1141},{"uri":"Lee_County%2C_Texas","surface_form":"Lee County, Texas","offset":1151},{"uri":"German_language","surface_form":"German","offset":1302},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1313}]}
