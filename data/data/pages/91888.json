During World War II, she joined the resistance in the democratic armed group \"Giustizia e Libert\u00E0\". Her father Edoardo Fallaci, was a famous antifascist political activist, in Florence.\nFallaci began her journalistic career in her teens, becoming a special correspondent for the Italian paper \"Il mattino dell'Italia centrale\" in 1946.

During the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre prior to the 1968 Summer Olympics, Fallaci was shot three times, dragged down stairs by her hair, and left for dead by Mexican forces. The demonstrations by immigrants in the United States these past few months \"disgust\" her, especially when protesters displayed the Mexican flag. \"I don't love the Mexicans,\" Fallaci said, invoking her nasty treatment at the hands of Mexican police in 1968. \"If you hold a gun and say, 'Choose who is worse between the Muslims and the Mexicans,' I have a moment of hesitation. Then I choose the Muslims, because they have broken my balls.\"\nIn the late 1970s, she had an affair with the subject of one of her interviews, Alexandros Panagoulis, who was a big rebel in the Greek resistance against the 1967 dictatorship, having been captured, heavily tortured and imprisoned for his (unsuccessful) assassination attempt against dictator and ex-Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos.
