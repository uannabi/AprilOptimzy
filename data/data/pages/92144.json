It housed over 500 female survivors of other camps, including Auschwitz Birkenau. Altogether 50 or so SS women worked in this camp until its evacuation in April 1945. The female survivors later reached the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Free_State_of_Saxony","surface_form":"Free State of Saxony","offset":49},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":71},{"uri":"Freiberg_Rural_District","surface_form":"Freiberg Rural District","offset":95},{"uri":"1186","surface_form":"1186","offset":144},{"uri":"Ore_Mountains","surface_form":"Ore Mountains","offset":202},{"uri":"Flossenburg_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Flossenburg concentration camp","offset":243},{"uri":"Auschwitz_Birkenau","surface_form":"Auschwitz Birkenau","offset":382},{"uri":"SS","surface_form":"SS","offset":422},{"uri":"Mauthausen_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Mauthausen concentration camp","offset":526},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":559}]}
