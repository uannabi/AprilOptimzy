{"id":9224,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor","text":"e=\"preserve\">An emperor is a male who rules an empire. The word is taken from the Latin language \"imperator\". Often it is capitalized.\nA woman who comes to power in an empire is called an \"empress\". The wife of an emperor is also called empress. An emperor or empress is often a hereditary monarch and comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, dies. In some countries, people elected a new emperor from candidates.\nThe only emperor in the world today is the Emperor of Japan (\"tenn\u014D\"), but he lacks political power. The true leaders of Japan are the Diet and Prime Minister because the country is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.\nThe English word comes from Latin, the language of the old Roman Empire. At first, an \"imperator\" was a powerful general (army leader) but, after Augustus, it was only used by their most powerful rulers. There have been many countries in history whose leaders are called \"emperor\" in English. The leaders of the Byzantine Empire (\"basileus\", \"autokrator\") in Greece, the Holy Roman Empire (\"imperator\", \"Kaiser\") in Germany, Russian Empire (\"tsar\"), and the Ottoman Empire (\"sultan\", \"padishah\", \"khagan\", \"kaysar\") in Turkey all said they were just new parts of the old Roman Empire.\nThe leaders of other countries who said they ruled the whole world or called themselves \"king of kings\" are frequently also called emperors in English. For example, the old rulers of China (\"huangdi\"), and Ethiopia (\"negusa negast\") are all known as emperors in English. There have also been emperors of France, Germany, and Mexico and the rulers of the United Kingdom called themselves the emperors and empresses of India for a while.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Male","surface_form":"male","offset":29},{"uri":"Empire","surface_form":"empire","offset":47},{"uri":"Latin_language","surface_form":"Latin language","offset":82},{"uri":"Capitalization","surface_form":"capitalized","offset":122},{"uri":"Hereditary_monarchy","surface_form":"hereditary monarch","offset":279},{"uri":"Relative","surface_form":"relative","offset":345},{"uri":"Death","surface_form":"dies","offset":356},{"uri":"Candidate","surface_form":"candidate","offset":415},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Japan","surface_form":"Emperor of Japan","offset":470},{"uri":"Diet_of_Japan","surface_form":"Diet","offset":562},{"uri":"Prime_Minister_of_Japan","surface_form":"Prime Minister","offset":571},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliamentary","offset":611},{"uri":"Constitutional_monarchy","surface_form":"constitutional monarchy","offset":625},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":654},{"uri":"Latin","surface_form":"Latin","offset":678},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":709},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"general","offset":763},{"uri":"Augustus","surface_form":"Augustus","offset":796},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Rome","surface_form":"most powerful rulers","offset":832},{"uri":"Countries","surface_form":"countries","offset":875},{"uri":"History","surface_form":"history","offset":888},{"uri":"Byzantine_Empire","surface_form":"Byzantine Empire","offset":962},{"uri":"Byzantine_emperor","surface_form":"basileus","offset":981},{"uri":"Byzantine_emperor","surface_form":"autokrator","offset":993},{"uri":"Greece","surface_form":"Greece","offset":1009},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Holy Roman Empire","offset":1021},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"imperator","offset":1041},{"uri":"Holy_Roman_Emperor","surface_form":"Kaiser","offset":1054},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1066},{"uri":"Russian_Empire","surface_form":"Russian Empire","offset":1075},{"uri":"Tsar","surface_form":"tsar","offset":1092},{"uri":"Ottoman_Empire","surface_form":"Ottoman Empire","offset":1108},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":1169},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Roman Empire","offset":1221},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"whole world","offset":1290},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":1324},{"uri":"King","surface_form":"king","offset":1332},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1378},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1418},{"uri":"Emperor_of_China","surface_form":"huangdi","offset":1426},{"uri":"Ethiopia","surface_form":"Ethiopia","offset":1441},{"uri":"Emperor_of_Ethiopia","surface_form":"negusa negast","offset":1452},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1497},{"uri":"Emperor_of_the_French","surface_form":"France","offset":1539},{"uri":"German_Empire","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1547},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1560},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1589},{"uri":"Emperors_and_empresses_of_India","surface_form":"emperors and empresses of India","offset":1626}]}
