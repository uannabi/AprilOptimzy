{"id":92261,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horse_Film_Festival_and_Awards","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards or simply Golden Horse is a movie festival and awards ceremony held annually in Taiwan. The ceremony usually takes place in November or December in Taipei.\nThe awards, contested by movies submitted from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and elsewhere, are generally held to be the most prestigious for Chinese language movies outside the People's Republic of China. The awards ceremony is held after the month-long movie festival, which showcases some of the nominated movies for the awards.\nWinners are selected by a jury of judges during the week before the ceremony is held. Winners are awarded with a golden horse statuette.\nUnder current rules and regulations, every movie made primarily in any dialect of Chinese language is eligible for competition. Since 1996, almost any artist or movie from mainland China was allowed to enter the movie festival.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Award","surface_form":"award","offset":102},{"uri":"Ceremony","surface_form":"ceremony","offset":109},{"uri":"Year","surface_form":"annually","offset":123},{"uri":"Taiwan","surface_form":"Taiwan","offset":135},{"uri":"November","surface_form":"November","offset":179},{"uri":"December","surface_form":"December","offset":191},{"uri":"Taipei","surface_form":"Taipei","offset":203},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"China","offset":277},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese language","offset":348},{"uri":"Jury","surface_form":"jury","offset":564},{"uri":"Judge","surface_form":"judge","offset":572},{"uri":"Dialect","surface_form":"dialect","offset":746},{"uri":"Chinese_language","surface_form":"Chinese language","offset":757},{"uri":"1996","surface_form":"1996","offset":809},{"uri":"People%27s_Republic_of_China","surface_form":"mainland China","offset":847}]}
