{"id":92287,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes","text":"Langston Hughes (1902 \u2013 May 22, 1967) was an American poet, novelist, playwright and short story writer. Hughes was one of the writers and artists whose work was called the Harlem Renaissance.\nHughes grew up as a poor boy from Missouri, the descendant of African people who had been taken to America as slaves. At that time, the term used for African-Americans was \"negro\" which means a person with black skin. Most \"negroes\" did not remember or think about their link with the people of Africa, even though it was a big influence on their culture and, in particular, their music. Hughes was unusual for his time, because he went back to West Africa to understand more about his own culture. Through his poetry, plays, and stories, Hughes helped other black Americans to see themselves as part of a much bigger group of people, so that now the term \"African-American\" is used with pride.\nHughes became a famous writer, but all his life he remembered how he started out, and he helped and encouraged many other struggling writers.\nChildhood.\nLangston Hughes was born on February 1, 1902 in Joplin, Missouri. His parents were James Hughes and Carrie Langston Hughes who was a teacher. Langston's father, James Hughes, was so upset about the racism towards African-Americans that he left his family and moved to Mexico. During his childhood, Hughes was cared for by his grandmother, in Lawrence, Kansas while his mother worked to support the family. Langston's grandmother was a great story teller. She told stories that made him feel proud to be an African-American.\nAfter his grandmother died, Hughes and his mother moved about 12 times until settling in Cleveland, and then, as a teenager went to live in Lincoln, Illinois with his mother, who had remarried. He was often left alone because his mother was at work. Even though his childhood was difficult and had lots of changes, he was able to use these things in the poetry that he started to write while he was at school. He never forgot the stories of his grandmother and tried to help other African-Americans when they were having problems. These were the people that he later wrote about in his own stories.\nWhen Hughes went to school in Lincoln, there were only two African-American children in the class. The teacher talked to them about poetry. She said that what a poem needed most was rhythm. Langston later said that he had rhythm in his blood because, \"as everyone knows\", \"all\" African-Americans have rhythm. The children made him the \"class poet\".\nAt high school in Cleveland, Ohio, Langston learned to love reading. He loved the poetry of the American poets Paul Laurence Dunbar and Carl Sandburg. He wrote articles for the school newspaper, he edited the school yearbook and he wrote his first short stories and plays.\nHughes' father and Columbia University.\nWhen Langston Hughes was 17, he went to spend some time with his father in Mexico. He was so unhappy while he was there that he thought about committing suicide. Hughes could not understand how his father felt. He said: \"I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much!\"\nWhen he was finished at high school in Lincoln in 1920, he went back to Mexico, to ask his father to pay for him to go to university. Hughes' father was a lawyer and a wealthy landowner. He could afford to send his son to university but he made difficulties about it. He said that Hughes could only go to university if he went overseas and studied engineering. Hughes wanted to go to a university in the US. After a time, they made an agreement that he should go to Columbia University but study engineering, not an arts degree. He went to Columbia in 1921 but left in 1922, partly because of the racism in the university.\nAdult life.\nUntil 1926 Hughes did many different types of work. In 1923 he went as a crewman on the ship \"S.S.Malone\" and went to West Africa and Europe. He left the ship and stayed for a short time in Paris where he joined several other African-Americans who were living there. In November 1924, Hughes returned to the U.S. to live with his mother in Washington, D.C.. In 1925 he got a job as an assistant to Carter G. Woodson who worked with the \"Association for the Study of African American Life and History\". Hughes did not enjoy his work because he did not have enough time to write, so he left and got a job as a \"busboy\", wiping tables and washing dishes at a hotel. Hughes is sometimes called \"The Busboy Poet\". Meanwhile, some of his poems were published in magazines and were being collected together for his first book of poetry. While he was working at the hotel he met the poet Vachel Lindsay, who helped to make Hughes known as a new African-American poet.\nIn 1926 Hughes began studying at Lincoln University, Pennsylvania. He had help from patrons, Amy Spingarn, who gave him $300 and \"Godmother\" Charlotte Osgood Mason. Hughes graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1929 and became a Doctor of Letters in 1943. He was also given an honorary doctorate by Howard University. For the rest of his life, except when he travelled to the Caribbean or West Indies, Hughes lived in Harlem, New York.\nLangston Hughes sometimes went out with women, but he never married. People who have studied his life and poetry are sure that he was homosexual. In the 1930s it was harder to be open about being gay than it is nowadays. His poetry has lots of symbols which are used by other homosexual writers. Hughes thought that men who had very dark skin were particularly beautiful. It seems from his poetry that he was in love with an African-American man. He also wrote a story which might tell of his own experience. \"Blessed Assurance\" is the story of a father's anger because his son is \"queer\" and acts like a girl.\nHughes' life and work were an important part of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, alongside those Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, Richard Bruce Nugent, and Aaron Douglas, who together started a magazine \"Fire!! Devoted to Younger Negro Artists\". Hughes and these friends did not always agree with the ideas of some of the other African-American writers who were also part of the \"Harlem Renaissance\" because they thought their ideas were Middle class and that they treated others who had darker skin, less education and less money with discrimination. All his life, Hughes never forgot the lessons that he learned about poor and uneducated African-Americans in the stories that his grandmother told.\nIn 1960, the \"NAACP\" awarded Hughes the \"Spingarn Medal\" for \"distinguished achievements by an African American\". Hughes became a member of the \"National Institute of Arts and Letters\" in 1961. In 1973, an award was named after him, the \"Langston Hughes Medal\", awarded by the City College of New York.\nHughes became a famous American poet, but he was always ready to help other people, particularly young black writers. He was worried that many young writers hated themselves, and expressed these feelings to the world. He tried to help people feel pride, and not worry about the prejudice of other people. He also tried to help young African-Americans not to express hatred and prejudice towards white Americans.\nDeath.\nOn May 22, 1967, Hughes died in New York City at the age of 65 after having surgery for prostate cancer. His ashes are buried under the floor of the \"Langston Hughes Auditorium\" in the \"Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\" in Harlem. Over his ashes is a circle with an African design called \"Rivers.\" At the centre of the design are words from a poem by Hughes: \"My soul has grown deep like the rivers.\"","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Americans","surface_form":"American","offset":45},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":54},{"uri":"Novel","surface_form":"novel","offset":60},{"uri":"Playwright","surface_form":"playwright","offset":70},{"uri":"Short_story","surface_form":"short story","offset":85},{"uri":"Harlem_Renaissance","surface_form":"Harlem Renaissance","offset":173},{"uri":"Missouri","surface_form":"Missouri","offset":227},{"uri":"Descendant","surface_form":"descendant","offset":241},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":255},{"uri":"Slave","surface_form":"slave","offset":303},{"uri":"African-American","surface_form":"African-American","offset":343},{"uri":"Negro","surface_form":"negro","offset":366},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":488},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"culture","offset":540},{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":574},{"uri":"West_Africa","surface_form":"West Africa","offset":638},{"uri":"Joplin%2C_Missouri","surface_form":"Joplin, Missouri","offset":1089},{"uri":"Racism","surface_form":"racism","offset":1239},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexico","offset":1309},{"uri":"Childhood","surface_form":"childhood","offset":1328},{"uri":"Lawrence%2C_Kansas","surface_form":"Lawrence, Kansas","offset":1383},{"uri":"Lincoln%2C_Illinois","surface_form":"Lincoln, Illinois","offset":1705},{"uri":"Rhythm","surface_form":"rhythm","offset":2346},{"uri":"Cleveland%2C_Ohio","surface_form":"Cleveland, Ohio","offset":2531},{"uri":"Paul_Laurence_Dunbar","surface_form":"Paul Laurence Dunbar","offset":2624},{"uri":"Carl_Sandburg","surface_form":"Carl Sandburg","offset":2649},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":2979},{"uri":"University","surface_form":"university","offset":3327},{"uri":"Engineering","surface_form":"engineering","offset":3553},{"uri":"Columbia_University","surface_form":"Columbia University","offset":3671},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":3974},{"uri":"Paris","surface_form":"Paris","offset":4030},{"uri":"Washington%2C_D.C.","surface_form":"Washington, D.C.","offset":4180},{"uri":"Vachel_Lindsay","surface_form":"Vachel Lindsay","offset":4720},{"uri":"Lincoln_University%2C_Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Lincoln University, Pennsylvania","offset":4833},{"uri":"Patronage","surface_form":"patrons","offset":4884},{"uri":"Bachelor_of_Arts","surface_form":"Bachelor of Arts","offset":4989},{"uri":"Howard_University","surface_form":"Howard University","offset":5097},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":5174},{"uri":"West_Indies","surface_form":"West Indies","offset":5187},{"uri":"Harlem","surface_form":"Harlem","offset":5216},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":5224},{"uri":"Symbol","surface_form":"symbol","offset":5478},{"uri":"Zora_Neale_Hurston","surface_form":"Zora Neale Hurston","offset":5946},{"uri":"Wallace_Thurman","surface_form":"Wallace Thurman","offset":5966},{"uri":"Countee_Cullen","surface_form":"Countee Cullen","offset":5983},{"uri":"Richard_Bruce_Nugent","surface_form":"Richard Bruce Nugent","offset":5999},{"uri":"Aaron_Douglas","surface_form":"Aaron Douglas","offset":6025},{"uri":"Middle_class","surface_form":"Middle class","offset":6307},{"uri":"Discrimination","surface_form":"discrimination","offset":6405},{"uri":"Award","surface_form":"award","offset":6775},{"uri":"Prejudice","surface_form":"prejudice","offset":7150},{"uri":"New_York_City","surface_form":"New York City","offset":7323},{"uri":"Surgery","surface_form":"surgery","offset":7367},{"uri":"Prostate_cancer","surface_form":"prostate cancer","offset":7379}]}
