{"id":92384,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V","text":"Atlas V is an orbital launch vehicle used by the United Launch Alliance (made of two companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin) to place satellites into orbit. It is a rocket tall, and wide. It has flown 79 times, since its first flight on August 21, 2002. It was developed from the Atlas (missile). Unlike the Space Shuttle, Atlas V is only used once, with a new rocket being built for each flight.\nThe rocket is made of the first stage, a Common Core Booster with an RD-180 engine from Russia. Every Atlas V has this as the first stage. The second stage is called Centaur, and has one/two RL-10 engines from Aerojet Rocketdyne. On top is a wide fairing covering the spacecraft during launch.\nFlights.\nAs of the end of 2018, the Atlas V has made 79 flights. The most famous ones carried the New Horizons, Mars Science Laboratory (which had the Curiosity rover in it), Juno, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter/LCROSS, and the Boeing X-37B.\nTypes.\nThe Atlas V has a special way of naming the different kinds. The first number says how wide the fairing is. A 400 series Atlas V has a 4-meter wide fairing. A 500 series Atlas V has a 5-meter wide fairing. The second number says how many strap-on solid rocket boosters the rocket has. An Atlas V 501 has no strap-on boosters, but an Atlas V 421 has 2 strap-on boosters. The last number says how many engines the Centaur second stage has. All of the Atlas V rockets flown have had only 1 engine on the Centaur, but in the future other Atlas V rockets will have 2 engines on the Centaur second stage. There is also the HLV which has two of the first stage (Common Core Booster) strapped on like strap-on boosters, but it has never flown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["rocket","rocket/payload","rocket/stage","rocket/stage","rocket/stage"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Launch_vehicle","surface_form":"launch vehicle","offset":22},{"uri":"United_Launch_Alliance","surface_form":"United Launch Alliance","offset":49},{"uri":"Boeing","surface_form":"Boeing","offset":96},{"uri":"Lockheed_Martin","surface_form":"Lockheed Martin","offset":107},{"uri":"Satellite_(artificial)","surface_form":"satellite","offset":133},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":149},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"rocket","offset":164},{"uri":"Atlas_(missile)","surface_form":"Atlas (missile)","offset":279},{"uri":"Space_Shuttle","surface_form":"Space Shuttle","offset":307},{"uri":"RD-180","surface_form":"RD-180","offset":465},{"uri":"RL-10","surface_form":"RL-10","offset":587},{"uri":"Aerojet_Rocketdyne","surface_form":"Aerojet Rocketdyne","offset":606},{"uri":"New_Horizons","surface_form":"New Horizons","offset":788},{"uri":"Mars_Science_Laboratory","surface_form":"Mars Science Laboratory","offset":802},{"uri":"Curiosity_rover","surface_form":"Curiosity rover","offset":841},{"uri":"Juno_(spacecraft)","surface_form":"Juno","offset":865},{"uri":"Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter","surface_form":"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter","offset":875},{"uri":"Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter","surface_form":"Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter","offset":908},{"uri":"Lunar_Crater_Observation_and_Sensing_Satellite","surface_form":"LCROSS","offset":937},{"uri":"Boeing_X-37","surface_form":"Boeing X-37","offset":953}]}
