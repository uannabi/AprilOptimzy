{"id":92409,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier","text":"Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (21 March 1768 \u2013 30 May 1830) was a French mathematician and physicist. He is best known for starting the investigation of Fourier series. He used them for work on problems of heat flow. Fourier also helped the discovery of the greenhouse effect, by suggesting the atmosphere might act as an insulator.\nLife.\nFourier was born at Auxerre as the son of a tailor. He lost both his parents at the age of 9. He then went on to study at the Convent of St Mark.\nHe joined the military academy in Auxerre. Aged sixteen, he became a teacher. At age 26, he entered the \u00C9cole normale sup\u00E9rieure in Paris. People like Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Gaspard Monge, and Pierre-Simon de Laplace were among his teachers.\nHe took part in the French Revolution of 1789. During the Reign of Terror he was almost executed at the guillotine, but the death of Robespierre saved him this fate. He later took part in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria.\nLater, as a diplomat, he is put in charge of the scientific background of the Institut d'\u00C9gypte. On his return, Napoleon put him in charge of the Is\u00E8re department.\nIn 1810, Fourier created the university in Grenoble, and becomes its first head. In 1817, Fourier became a Member of the Acad\u00E9mie des Sciences. On the death of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Delambre in 1822 he became head of the mathematics section. In 1826, Fourier was elected to the Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":65},{"uri":"Mathematician","surface_form":"mathematician","offset":72},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":90},{"uri":"Fourier_series","surface_form":"Fourier series","offset":152},{"uri":"Greenhouse_effect","surface_form":"greenhouse effect","offset":257},{"uri":"Atmosphere","surface_form":"atmosphere","offset":294},{"uri":"Thermal_insulation","surface_form":"insulator","offset":321},{"uri":"Auxerre","surface_form":"Auxerre","offset":358},{"uri":"Tailor","surface_form":"tailor","offset":382},{"uri":"%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure","surface_form":"\u00C9cole normale sup\u00E9rieure","offset":588},{"uri":"Joseph-Louis_Lagrange","surface_form":"Joseph-Louis Lagrange","offset":635},{"uri":"Gaspard_Monge","surface_form":"Gaspard Monge","offset":658},{"uri":"Pierre-Simon_de_Laplace","surface_form":"Pierre-Simon de Laplace","offset":677},{"uri":"French_Revolution","surface_form":"French Revolution","offset":746},{"uri":"Reign_of_Terror","surface_form":"Reign of Terror","offset":784},{"uri":"Guillotine","surface_form":"guillotine","offset":830},{"uri":"Robespierre","surface_form":"Robespierre","offset":859},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":937},{"uri":"Syria","surface_form":"Syria","offset":947},{"uri":"Diplomat","surface_form":"diplomat","offset":966},{"uri":"Institut_d%27%C3%89gypte","surface_form":"Institut d'\u00C9gypte","offset":1032},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":1066},{"uri":"Is%C3%A8re","surface_form":"Is\u00E8re","offset":1100},{"uri":"Grenoble","surface_form":"Grenoble","offset":1161},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_des_sciences_(France)","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie des Sciences","offset":1239},{"uri":"Jean-Baptiste_Joseph_Delambre","surface_form":"Jean-Baptiste Joseph Delambre","offset":1278},{"uri":"Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise","surface_form":"Acad\u00E9mie fran\u00E7aise","offset":1395}]}
