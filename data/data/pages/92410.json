{"id":92410,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server","text":"=\"preserve\">A file server is a computer joined to a web network or to a home network, and that can store many files in the server's hard disk(s).\nCharacteristics.\nThe file server can be a normal computer, or a Network Attached Storage, which is a special computer created to only be a file server. Often people recycle their old computer and they modify it to become a file server which can hold photos, songs, films, and backups. Sometimes web servers that are \"hand made\" are used as a media center, people put things on the file server (for example movies) and then watch (or use) the things on the file server, often on a Television (like how a DVD player works).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":31},{"uri":"Network","surface_form":"network","offset":56},{"uri":"Hard_disk","surface_form":"hard disk","offset":132},{"uri":"Network_Attached_Storage","surface_form":"Network Attached Storage","offset":210},{"uri":"Backup","surface_form":"backup","offset":422},{"uri":"Server","surface_form":"web servers","offset":441},{"uri":"Media_center","surface_form":"media center","offset":488},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"Television","offset":626},{"uri":"DVD","surface_form":"DVD","offset":649}]}
