{"id":92465,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger","text":"Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" (OV-099) was the second space shuttle used by NASA to fly into outer space. The shuttle broke up 73 seconds after take-off from Cape Canaveral on 28 January 1986.\nAll seven astronauts who were on it at the time were killed. The crash happened because a rubber tube called an o-ring did not expand to fill a gap in one of the booster rockets, due to cold weather.\nThe Challenger was named after a Royal Navy ship that explored the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans from 1872 to 1876. Challenger was also the name of the Apollo 17 Lunar Excursion Module.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Space_shuttle","surface_form":"space shuttle","offset":51},{"uri":"NASA","surface_form":"NASA","offset":73},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"outer space","offset":90},{"uri":"Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster","surface_form":"broke up","offset":115},{"uri":"Cape_Canaveral%2C_Florida","surface_form":"Cape Canaveral","offset":155},{"uri":"Rubber","surface_form":"rubber","offset":280},{"uri":"Tube","surface_form":"tube","offset":287},{"uri":"O-ring","surface_form":"o-ring","offset":302},{"uri":"Rocket","surface_form":"booster rockets","offset":352},{"uri":"Weather","surface_form":"weather","offset":381},{"uri":"Pacific_Ocean","surface_form":"Pacific","offset":457},{"uri":"Apollo_17","surface_form":"Apollo 17","offset":540}]}
