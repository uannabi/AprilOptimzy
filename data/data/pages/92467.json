{"id":92467,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simlish","text":"e=\"preserve\">Simlish is a made-up language spoken on the \"Sims\" console games. It was created because changing the Sims' words into the players' language would cost a lot of money and would make the Sims say the same words all the time. Simlish is spoken by Sims, the characters in \"The Sims\", \"The Sims 2\", \"The Sims 3\" and \"The Sims 4\".\nSentences in Simlish.\nAll of these phrases are from \"The Sims\".\nWritten Simlish.\nWritten Simlish is seen on \"The Sims 2\", \"The Sims 3\", and \u2018\u2018The Sims 4\u2019\u2019. It looks similar to Zodiac symbols taken from the Wingdings font on a computer. Text such as the names of Sims, hints and tips and on-screen messages are all in the selected language (i.e. English, French, Spanish), and are usually written in the Comic Sans MS font.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":34},{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"console games","offset":64},{"uri":"Sims","surface_form":"Sims","offset":258},{"uri":"Fictional_character","surface_form":"characters","offset":268},{"uri":"The_Sims","surface_form":"The Sims","offset":283},{"uri":"The_Sims_2","surface_form":"The Sims 2","offset":295},{"uri":"The_Sims_3","surface_form":"The Sims 3","offset":309},{"uri":"The_Sims_4","surface_form":"The Sims 4","offset":326},{"uri":"Zodiac","surface_form":"Zodiac","offset":515},{"uri":"Wingdings","surface_form":"Wingdings","offset":545},{"uri":"Font","surface_form":"font","offset":555},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":565},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":684},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":693},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":701}]}
