The Oderbruch is about in length and in width. It was partially drained in the 18th century, and people started to live in the new area.\nHistory.\nThe districts of Lebus and Oberbarnim were both created in 1816. In 1952, the districts were split into three parts, the districts Bad Freienwalde, Seelow and Strausberg. In 1993 the three parts were joined together to form the current district.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Brandenburg","surface_form":"Brandenburg","offset":65},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":78},{"uri":"Oder","surface_form":"Oder","offset":185},{"uri":"18th_century","surface_form":"18th century","offset":293},{"uri":"Lebus","surface_form":"Lebus","offset":377},{"uri":"Oberbarnim","surface_form":"Oberbarnim","offset":387},{"uri":"Bad_Freienwalde","surface_form":"Bad Freienwalde","offset":491},{"uri":"Seelow","surface_form":"Seelow","offset":508},{"uri":"Strausberg","surface_form":"Strausberg","offset":519}]}
