{"id":92557,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharijite","text":"\"Kharijites\" were a movement during the early years of Islam. This movement has no followers today. At first they accepted the rule of Ali, but rejected him to later support the view that Abu Bakr, and his successors were the rightful Caliphs. The only group of Kharijites that still exists are the Ibadi. The Ibadi do not consider themselves to be Kharijite. Most Ibadis live in Oman. Smaller numbers live in Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Zanzibar.\nSometimes, the term \"Kharijite\" (or \"Neo-Kharijite\") is also used for some Islamic terrorist groups. Examples of such groups are the Groupe islamique arm\u00E9 in Algeria, or the Takfir wal-Hijra in Egypt.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Islam","surface_form":"Islam","offset":55},{"uri":"Abu_Bakr","surface_form":"Abu Bakr","offset":188},{"uri":"Caliph","surface_form":"Caliph","offset":235},{"uri":"Ibadi","surface_form":"Ibadi","offset":299},{"uri":"Oman","surface_form":"Oman","offset":380},{"uri":"Algeria","surface_form":"Algeria","offset":410},{"uri":"Tunisia","surface_form":"Tunisia","offset":419},{"uri":"Libya","surface_form":"Libya","offset":428},{"uri":"Zanzibar","surface_form":"Zanzibar","offset":438},{"uri":"Terrorist","surface_form":"terrorist","offset":531},{"uri":"Groupe_islamique_arm%C3%A9","surface_form":"Groupe islamique arm\u00E9","offset":581},{"uri":"Takfir_wal-Hijra","surface_form":"Takfir wal-Hijra","offset":622},{"uri":"Egypt","surface_form":"Egypt","offset":642}]}
