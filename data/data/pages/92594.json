{"id":92594,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50","text":"The IC50 is a measure of how effective a drug is. It indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. In other words, it is the half minimal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC50). It is commonly used as a measure of antagonist drug potency in pharmacological research. Sometimes, it is also converted to the pIC50 scale (-log IC50), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. According to the FDA, IC50 represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50% inhibition \"in vitro\".\nIt is comparable to an EC50 for agonist drugs. EC50 also represents the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum effect \"in vivo\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Drug","surface_form":"drug","offset":41},{"uri":"Enzyme","surface_form":"enzyme","offset":196},{"uri":"Cell_(biology)","surface_form":"cell","offset":204},{"uri":"Cell_receptor","surface_form":"cell receptor","offset":210},{"uri":"Microorganism","surface_form":"microorganism","offset":227},{"uri":"Receptor_antagonists","surface_form":"antagonist drug","offset":396},{"uri":"Potency","surface_form":"potency","offset":412},{"uri":"Food_and_Drug_Administration","surface_form":"FDA","offset":593},{"uri":"Half_maximal_effective_concentration","surface_form":"EC50","offset":713},{"uri":"Agonist","surface_form":"agonist drugs","offset":722}]}
