It is one of the ten main locations of NASA.Since December 1968, Kennedy Space Center has been the main launch center of human spaceflight of the United States. It borders on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which helps the Space Center.\nFacilities.\nThere are about 700 facilities and buildings in the of KSC. The unique facilities of KSC are the tall \"Vehicle Assembly Building\", the Launch Complex 39 (39A, 39B and 39C), the long \"Shuttle Landing Facility\", the 4-storey tall \"Launch Control Center\", and the \"Visitor Complex\".\nVehicle Assembly Building.\nThe Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the largest building at KSC. It assemble large rockets, for example the Saturn V and the Space Shuttle. The future rocket Space Launch System (SLS) will also be assembled there.\nLaunch Complex 39.\nThe Launch Complex 39 (LC-39) is a rocket launch facility of KSC. The site was originally made for the Apollo program. Later, it was modified for the Space Shuttle program., only Pad 39A is in use to launch SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. Pad 39B is modifying for NASA's Space Launch System. The Pad 39C was added in 2015 for small rocket launches, although it is not in use.\nShuttle Landing Facility.\nThe Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) is an airport of KSC. It was used for landing of the Space Shuttle until 2011. It is also used for take offs and landings for NASA airplanes, for example the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and some civilian airplanes.\nLaunch Control Center.\nThe Launch Control Center (LCC) is a building at KSC. It controls the rocket launches from Launch Complex 39.\nFactories.\nSeveral factory buildings are on-site at KSC, for the manufacture and processing of space station components. They include the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF), and the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building (O&C).\nVisitor Complex.\nThe Visitor Complex is the visitor center of KSC. It has exhibits and displays, historic spacecraft and memorabilia, movies, and a bus tour of the KSC., about 1,700,000 people visited the center.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["organization"],"annotations":[{"uri":"John_F._Kennedy","surface_form":"John F.
