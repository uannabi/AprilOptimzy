{"id":92864,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Islands_Bridge","text":"The Thousand Islands Bridge is an international bridge that goes over the Saint Lawrence River. It connects the north part of New York in the United States with south east part of Ontario in Canada. It was made in 1937. Builders added parts in 1959. The bridge goes over the edge that Canada and United States share in the middle of the Thousand Islands area. It gets its name from the name of the area. The bridge is governed by the Thousand Island Bridge Authority, an agency that works around the world.\nThe bridge is actually not a single bridge. It is really a lot of bridges that go across parts of the St. Lawrence River, eventually connecting both sides. The south end of the bridge connects with Interstate 81, an interstate. The north side of the bridge connects to Highway 137, a highway in Ontario. There is also an intersection with the Thousand Islands Parkway, a mini highway on the Ontario side.\nThousand Island Bridge Authority is doing a study to find out when the bridge will get to its working limits and how to make no waiting time on the bridge.\nThe international border is actually between Wellesley Island in the United States and Hill Island in Canada.\nThe bridge is actually much taller than it appears in the photograph to the right. The highest point is 150 feet above the water.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Saint_Lawrence_River","surface_form":"Saint Lawrence River","offset":74},{"uri":"New_York","surface_form":"New York","offset":126},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":142},{"uri":"Ontario","surface_form":"Ontario","offset":180},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":191},{"uri":"1937","surface_form":"1937","offset":214},{"uri":"1959","surface_form":"1959","offset":244},{"uri":"Interstate_81","surface_form":"Interstate 81","offset":705},{"uri":"Interstate","surface_form":"interstate","offset":723},{"uri":"Highway","surface_form":"highway","offset":791}]}
