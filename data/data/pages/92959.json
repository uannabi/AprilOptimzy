{"id":92959,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Doberan_(district)","text":"Bad Doberan is a former district in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany.\nIn the Middle Ages the region was made rich because Hanseatic city of Rostock was close. Today the city of Rostock is surrounded by the district, but not a part of it.\nIn 1793 the bathing resort of Heiligendamm (today a borough of Bad Doberan) was started, and the region became a summer residence for the dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\nIn 1952 the districts of Bad Doberan and Rostock-Land were made. They were joined in 1994 to make the present district.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":24},{"uri":"Mecklenburg-Western_Pomerania","surface_form":"Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania","offset":36},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":67},{"uri":"Hanseatic_League","surface_form":"Hanseatic","offset":128},{"uri":"Rostock","surface_form":"Rostock","offset":146},{"uri":"1793","surface_form":"1793","offset":247},{"uri":"Borough","surface_form":"borough","offset":296},{"uri":"Mecklenburg-Schwerin","surface_form":"Mecklenburg-Schwerin","offset":391},{"uri":"1952","surface_form":"1952","offset":416},{"uri":"Bad_Doberan","surface_form":"Bad Doberan","offset":438},{"uri":"Rostock-Land","surface_form":"Rostock-Land","offset":454},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":498}]}
