{"id":92985,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg-Strelitz_Rural_District","text":"Mecklenburg-Strelitz is a former district in the southern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The district-free city (urban district) of Neubrandenburg is nearly completely surrounded by Mecklenburg-Strelitz district.\nThe capital of the duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was the town of Strelitz. In 1712 a fire completely destroyed the town. The duke decided to build a new town on the shores of a small lake called the Zierker See. This town became Neustrelitz, or in English \"New Strelitz\".\nThe district was created by joining the three old districts Neubrandenburg, Neustrelitz and Strasburg in 1994.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":33},{"uri":"Mecklenburg-Western_Pomerania","surface_form":"Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania","offset":66},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":97},{"uri":"Neubrandenburg","surface_form":"Neubrandenburg","offset":149},{"uri":"Mecklenburg-Strelitz","surface_form":"Mecklenburg-Strelitz","offset":258},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":478},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":607}]}
