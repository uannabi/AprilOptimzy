It originally formed in 1969 with Duane Allman (slide guitar), Gregg Allman (vocals, organ), Dickey Betts (guitar), Berry Oakley (bass guitar), Butch Trucks (drums) and Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson (drums).\nIn 1971, soon after their first album went gold, Duane and Berry were killed in separate motorcycle accidents in the group's hometown of Macon, Georgia. The group still released more albums and songs, most notably \"Ramblin' Man\" and \"Jessica\", which were their biggest hits. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked them 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004. The band is still touring as of 2008.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":33},{"uri":"Southern_rock","surface_form":"southern rock","offset":42},{"uri":"1970s","surface_form":"1970s","offset":68},{"uri":"1969","surface_form":"1969","offset":99},{"uri":"Duane_Allman","surface_form":"Duane Allman","offset":109},{"uri":"Gregg_Allman","surface_form":"Gregg Allman","offset":138},{"uri":"Dickey_Betts","surface_form":"Dickey Betts","offset":168},{"uri":"Berry_Oakley","surface_form":"Berry Oakley","offset":191},{"uri":"Butch_Trucks","surface_form":"Butch Trucks","offset":219},{"uri":"Jai_Johanny_%26quot%3BJaimoe%26quot%3B_Johanson","surface_form":"Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson","offset":244},{"uri":"1971","surface_form":"1971","offset":286},{"uri":"Motorcycle","surface_form":"motorcycle","offset":372},{"uri":"Macon%2C_Georgia","surface_form":"Macon, Georgia","offset":420},{"uri":"2008","surface_form":"2008","offset":686}]}
