They also battled with Eastern Wu, another Chinese dynasty at this time, and during one of the battles, Guan Yu was captured by the Wu general L\u00FC Meng and executed (along with his son Guan Ping).\nIn later centuries, Guan Yu became a Chinese deity and was given the name Guan Gong, meaning \"Lord Guan\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"160","surface_form":"160","offset":52},{"uri":"219","surface_form":"219","offset":58},{"uri":"General_officer","surface_form":"general","offset":69},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":122},{"uri":"Liu_Bei","surface_form":"Liu Bei","offset":157},{"uri":"Wei_Dynasty","surface_form":"Wei","offset":197},{"uri":"Han_Dynasty","surface_form":"Han-Emperor","offset":238},{"uri":"Zhang_Fei","surface_form":"Zhang Fei","offset":284},{"uri":"Dynasty","surface_form":"Dynasty","offset":391},{"uri":"Shu_Han","surface_form":"Shu Han","offset":405},{"uri":"Eastern_Wu","surface_form":"Eastern Wu","offset":506},{"uri":"L%C3%BC_Meng","surface_form":"L\u00FC Meng","offset":626},{"uri":"Deity","surface_form":"deity","offset":724}]}
