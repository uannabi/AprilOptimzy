The Ems river runs through the district from south to north. The highest point in Steinfurt is the \"Westerbecker Berg\" with 234m, the lowest point is the Bentlage castle at 32m.\nHistory.\nIn late medieval times Steinfurt became an independent earldom. At first it was a part of the earldom of Bentheim, before it became independent in 1454. 1804 Steinfurt was joined back with Bentheim, before it became a part of the Prussian province of Westphalia in 1815. The new government in 1816 made the districts Steinfurt and Tecklenburg.\nIn 1975 the old district Steinfurt was merged with the district Tecklenburg, and together with Greven and Saerbeck from the old district M\u00FCnster the current district was made.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"North_Rhine-Westphalia","surface_form":"North Rhine-Westphalia","offset":58},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":82},{"uri":"Bentheim","surface_form":"Bentheim","offset":117},{"uri":"Emsland","surface_form":"Emsland","offset":127},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck","offset":150},{"uri":"Osnabr%C3%BCck_(district)","surface_form":"Osnabr\u00FCck district","offset":168},{"uri":"Warendorf_(district)","surface_form":"Warendorf","offset":188},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"M\u00FCnster","offset":213},{"uri":"Coesfeld_(district)","surface_form":"Coesfeld","offset":222},{"uri":"Borken_(district)","surface_form":"Borken","offset":232},{"uri":"Lower_Saxony","surface_form":"Lower Saxon","offset":274},{"uri":"M%C3%BCnster","surface_form":"M\u00FCnster","offset":303},{"uri":"Ems_(river)","surface_form":"Ems","offset":316},{"uri":"Bentheim","surface_form":"Bentheim","offset":604},{"uri":"1454","surface_form":"1454","offset":646},{"uri":"1804","surface_form":"1804","offset":652},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":729},{"uri":"Province_of_Westphalia","surface_form":"province of Westphalia","offset":738},{"uri":"1815","surface_form":"1815","offset":764},{"uri":"1816","surface_form":"1816","offset":792},{"uri":"1975","surface_form":"1975","offset":846},{"uri":"Greven","surface_form":"Greven","offset":938},{"uri":"Saerbeck","surface_form":"Saerbeck","offset":949}]}
