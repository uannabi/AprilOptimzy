{"id":935,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine","text":"Wine is an alcoholic drink. The word \"wine\" is usually used to talk about drinks made from the juice of grapes, although people sometimes call alcoholic drinks made from the juice of other fruits (such as plums or blackberries) \"wine\". This article only deals with wine made from grapes.\nWine is made by the fermentation of the sugar in grapes. There are two main types of wine, red wine and white wine. Red wine is made from red grapes in contact with their skins, and white wine is made from red and white grapes, but without any skin contact. Ros\u00E9 wine is made by leaving red grapes in skin contact for a very short time. The colour comes only from the skin, so if you have short skin contact, the wine will not turn red but only \"pink\" (rose wine). Wine sometimes has bubbles in it; this wine is called sparkling wine. The most popular sparkling wines are champagne, which comes from France and spumante, from Italy.\nPeople have been making wine for about 5000 years.\nLuxembourg, France, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay, and Slovenia.\nItaly, France, Spain, USA, Argentina, Chile, Australia, South Africa, China and Germany.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Alcohol","surface_form":"alcohol","offset":11},{"uri":"Drink","surface_form":"drink","offset":21},{"uri":"Juice","surface_form":"juice","offset":95},{"uri":"Grape","surface_form":"grape","offset":104},{"uri":"Fruit","surface_form":"fruit","offset":189},{"uri":"Plums","surface_form":"plums","offset":205},{"uri":"Blackberries","surface_form":"blackberries","offset":214},{"uri":"Fermentation","surface_form":"fermentation","offset":308},{"uri":"Rose_wine","surface_form":"rose wine","offset":741},{"uri":"Sparkling_wine","surface_form":"sparkling wine","offset":807},{"uri":"Champagne_(wine)","surface_form":"champagne","offset":860},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":888},{"uri":"Spumante_(wine)","surface_form":"spumante","offset":899},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":914},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":972},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":984},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":992},{"uri":"Portugal","surface_form":"Portugal","offset":999},{"uri":"Croatia","surface_form":"Croatia","offset":1009},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":1018},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1031},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1038},{"uri":"Uruguay","surface_form":"Uruguay","offset":1049},{"uri":"Slovenia","surface_form":"Slovenia","offset":1062},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":1072},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":1079},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":1087},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"USA","offset":1094},{"uri":"Argentina","surface_form":"Argentina","offset":1099},{"uri":"Chile","surface_form":"Chile","offset":1110},{"uri":"Australia","surface_form":"Australia","offset":1117},{"uri":"South_Africa","surface_form":"South Africa","offset":1128},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":1142},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":1152}]}
