She is best known for the Weetzie Bat series of books. Block wrote her first book, \"Weetzie Bat\", while she was a student at UC Berkeley. Harper Collins published it in 1989. She is known for her use of imagery, or ability to paint pictures with words. This is best seen in describing the city of Los Angeles.\nBlock was born in Los Angeles to a poet and a painter. The creativity they gave Francesca was a big influence on what she wrote. Another influence was her love of Greek mythology and fairy tales when she was a child.\nBlock belongs to the Authors Guild, Authors League of America, and the Writers Guild of America.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles, California","offset":45},{"uri":"Writer","surface_form":"writer","offset":77},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":92},{"uri":"Teenager","surface_form":"teenager","offset":102},{"uri":"Weetzie_Bat","surface_form":"Weetzie Bat","offset":139},{"uri":"Student","surface_form":"student","offset":227},{"uri":"University_of_California%2C_Berkeley","surface_form":"UC Berkeley","offset":238},{"uri":"Publish","surface_form":"published","offset":266},{"uri":"Imagery","surface_form":"imagery","offset":316},{"uri":"Paint","surface_form":"paint","offset":339},{"uri":"Picture","surface_form":"picture","offset":345},{"uri":"Los_Angeles%2C_California","surface_form":"Los Angeles","offset":441},{"uri":"Poet","surface_form":"poet","offset":458},{"uri":"Painter","surface_form":"painter","offset":469},{"uri":"Creativity","surface_form":"creativity","offset":482},{"uri":"Influence","surface_form":"influence","offset":523},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek mythology","offset":586},{"uri":"Fairy_tale","surface_form":"fairy tale","offset":606},{"uri":"Authors_Guild","surface_form":"Authors Guild","offset":661},{"uri":"Authors_League_of_America","surface_form":"Authors League of America","offset":676},{"uri":"Writers_Guild_of_America","surface_form":"Writers Guild of America","offset":711}]}
