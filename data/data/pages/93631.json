Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Saarbr\u00FCcken, Neunkirchen, Kusel, S\u00FCdwestpfalz, district-free Zweibr\u00FCcken, and the French \"d\u00E9partement\" Moselle.\nHistory.\nWhen after World War I the Saar area went under special government of the League of Nations, the Palatinate area, then part of Bavaria, was split in two parts. The part which went into the Saar became commonly known as Saarpfalz, and was administered by the two \"Bezirksamt\": St. Ingbert and Homburg. The district Saarpfalz was created in 1974 when the two districts of Saint Ingbert and Homburg were joined. Since 1997 the district has a partnership with Henrico County, Virginia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":42},{"uri":"Saarland","surface_form":"Saarland","offset":77},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":87},{"uri":"Saarbr%C3%BCcken_(district)","surface_form":"Saarbr\u00FCcken","offset":144},{"uri":"Neunkirchen_(district)","surface_form":"Neunkirchen","offset":157},{"uri":"Kusel_(district)","surface_form":"Kusel","offset":170},{"uri":"S%C3%BCdwestpfalz","surface_form":"S\u00FCdwestpfalz","offset":177},{"uri":"Zweibr%C3%BCcken","surface_form":"Zweibr\u00FCcken","offset":205},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"French","offset":226},{"uri":"D%C3%A9partement","surface_form":"d\u00E9partement","offset":234},{"uri":"Moselle","surface_form":"Moselle","offset":247},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":276},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":339},{"uri":"Bavaria","surface_form":"Bavaria","offset":392},{"uri":"1974","surface_form":"1974","offset":604},{"uri":"1997","surface_form":"1997","offset":680},{"uri":"Twin_town","surface_form":"partnership","offset":704},{"uri":"Henrico_County%2C_Virginia","surface_form":"Henrico County, Virginia","offset":721}]}
