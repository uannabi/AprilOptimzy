{"id":93633,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankt_Wendel_(district)","text":"Sankt Wendel is a Kreis (district) in the north of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are Trier-Saarburg, Birkenfeld, Kusel, Neunkirchen, Saarlouis, Merzig-Wadern.\nHistory.\nThe district was created in 1834 when Prussia bought the Lichtenfeld area from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. After World War I the Saar area came under special rulership of the League of Nations, and the Sankt Wendel district was split into two parts. The northern part, the \"Restkreis Sankt Wendel\", was merged into the district Birkenfeld, the southern part stayed in the Saarland in its smaller size.\nGeography.\nThe district is located in the \"Saar-Hunsr\u00FCck\" natural area, a hilly area with elevations between 200 and 600 meters.\nThe main river in the district is the Nahe. The \"Bostalsee\" is the biggest tourist lake in the south-west of Germany, covering an area of about 1.2 km\u00B2.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"District","surface_form":"district","offset":25},{"uri":"Saarland","surface_form":"Saarland","offset":55},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":65},{"uri":"Trier-Saarburg","surface_form":"Trier-Saarburg","offset":100},{"uri":"Birkenfeld_(district)","surface_form":"Birkenfeld","offset":116},{"uri":"Kusel_(district)","surface_form":"Kusel","offset":128},{"uri":"Neunkirchen_(district)","surface_form":"Neunkirchen","offset":135},{"uri":"Saarlouis_(district)","surface_form":"Saarlouis","offset":148},{"uri":"Merzig-Wadern","surface_form":"Merzig-Wadern","offset":159},{"uri":"1834","surface_form":"1834","offset":211},{"uri":"Prussia","surface_form":"Prussia","offset":221},{"uri":"Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha","surface_form":"Saxe-Coburg and Gotha","offset":262},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":291},{"uri":"League_of_Nations","surface_form":"League of Nations","offset":353},{"uri":"Birkenfeld_(district)","surface_form":"Birkenfeld","offset":506},{"uri":"Saarland","surface_form":"Saarland","offset":550},{"uri":"Hunsr%C3%BCck","surface_form":"Hunsr\u00FCck","offset":628},{"uri":"Nahe","surface_form":"Nahe","offset":747}]}
