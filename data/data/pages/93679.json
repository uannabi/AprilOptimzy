{"id":93679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VI_of_France","text":"Charles VI of France (3 December 1368 \u2013 21 October 1422) was King of France from 1380 until his death. He was not a successful king.\nOften he was not able to rule the country because of mental illness and his wife Queen Isabeau of Bavaria ruled with the help of his brother Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans. This made his cousin John the Fearless of Burgundy very angry, so John the Fearless had Louis I assassinated. A few years after that, Henry V of England invaded and won the Battle of Agincourt.\nCharles had a mental illness from around 1410 until he died. His mental illness involved him killing some of his own servants and at one point he thought he was made of glass.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":69},{"uri":"1380","surface_form":"1380","offset":81},{"uri":"Mental_illness","surface_form":"mental illness","offset":186},{"uri":"Isabeau_of_Bavaria","surface_form":"Isabeau of Bavaria","offset":220},{"uri":"Louis_I_de_Valois%2C_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","surface_form":"Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans","offset":274},{"uri":"John_the_Fearless","surface_form":"John the Fearless","offset":331},{"uri":"Burgundy","surface_form":"Burgundy","offset":352},{"uri":"Assassination","surface_form":"assassinated","offset":406},{"uri":"Henry_V_of_England","surface_form":"Henry V of England","offset":444},{"uri":"Battle_of_Agincourt","surface_form":"Battle of Agincourt","offset":483}]}
