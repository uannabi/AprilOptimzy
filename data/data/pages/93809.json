{"id":93809,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Enriquillo","text":"Lake Enriquillo is a lake in western Dominican Republic, near the border with Haiti. Its Ta\u00EDno name was \"Hagueygagon\" but, in colonial times, it had the name \"Jaragua Lake\".\nIt is in the \"Hoya de Enriquillo\" valley, a long valley between the \"Sierra de Neiba\", to the north, and the \"Sierra de Bahoruco\", to the south.\nThe lake has an area of 265\u00A0km\u00B2, and its surface is around 44 meters below sea level, the lowest point in the Caribbean. There are three small islands in the lake: Isla Cabritos, Barbarita, and La Islita.\nOnly small rivers flow into the lake. The rivers that flow from the Sierra de Neiba always have water. Those rivers that flow from the Sierra de Bahoruco sometimes do not have water.\nIt is a salt water lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water because the rivers that flow into the lake are small and the evaporation of its water is high.\nMany water birds visit the lake to feed, including flamingos. There are also American crocodiles and some fishes as tilapia. Because it is an arid region, the vegetation around the lake is poor with cacti and small shrubs.\nThe lake is part of the \"Lago Enriquillo e Isla Cabritos National Park\" and of the \"Jaragua - Bahoruco - Enriquillo Biosphere Reserve\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Lake","surface_form":"lake","offset":21},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":37},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":78},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":89},{"uri":"Valley","surface_form":"valley","offset":208},{"uri":"Sea_level","surface_form":"sea level","offset":394},{"uri":"Caribbean","surface_form":"Caribbean","offset":429},{"uri":"Salt_water","surface_form":"salt water","offset":715},{"uri":"Evaporation","surface_form":"evaporation","offset":847},{"uri":"Birds","surface_form":"birds","offset":892},{"uri":"Flamingo","surface_form":"flamingo","offset":932},{"uri":"Crocodile","surface_form":"crocodile","offset":967},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":987},{"uri":"Tilapia","surface_form":"tilapia","offset":997},{"uri":"Vegetation","surface_form":"vegetation","offset":1040},{"uri":"Cactus","surface_form":"cacti","offset":1080},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":1096}]}
