He is featured in the Book of Daniel and is mentioned in several other books of the Bible. He (allegedly) destroyed Solomon's Temple.\nHe is said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The king built the hanging gardens in attempt to please his wife. His kingdom had a great flow of trade and prosperity. However, some scholars argue that the Gardens may have been constructed by the Assyrian king Sennacherib in his capital city, Nineveh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Neo-Babylonian_Empire","surface_form":"Neo-Babylonian Empire","offset":55},{"uri":"Bible","surface_form":"Bible","offset":125},{"uri":"Judah","surface_form":"Judah","offset":145},{"uri":"Jerusalem","surface_form":"Jerusalem","offset":155},{"uri":"Jews","surface_form":"Jews","offset":179},{"uri":"Exile","surface_form":"exile","offset":189},{"uri":"Book_of_Daniel","surface_form":"Book of Daniel","offset":218},{"uri":"Solomon%27s_Temple","surface_form":"Solomon's Temple","offset":312},{"uri":"Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon","surface_form":"Hanging Gardens of Babylon","offset":359},{"uri":"Trade","surface_form":"trade","offset":485},{"uri":"Assyria","surface_form":"Assyria","offset":586},{"uri":"Sennacherib","surface_form":"Sennacherib","offset":600},{"uri":"Nineveh","surface_form":"Nineveh","offset":633}]}
