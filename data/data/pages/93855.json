{"id":93855,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea","text":"\"Coffea\" (coffee) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Out of about 120 species, we make coffee from only two, \"Coffea arabica\" and \"C. canephora\".\n\"Coffea\" are shrubs or small trees, native to subtropical Africa and southern Asia. The seeds are called \"beans\" in the coffee trade. Beans from the two productive species are widely cultivated in tropical countries. Coffee is one of the world's major commodity crops and is the major export product of some countries.\nThe caffeine in coffee \"beans\" protects the seeds of the plant. It is a form of natural plant defense against herbivory. The fruits and leaves also contain caffeine, and can be used to make a tea called 'Coffee cherry tea'. The fruit is also used in many types of soft drink.\nSeveral insect pests attack the plants and affect coffee production.\nCoffee is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Flowering_plant","surface_form":"flowering plant","offset":32},{"uri":"Rubiaceae","surface_form":"Rubiaceae","offset":63},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":91},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":108},{"uri":"Shrub","surface_form":"shrub","offset":180},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":196},{"uri":"Subtropical","surface_form":"subtropical","offset":213},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":225},{"uri":"Asia","surface_form":"Asia","offset":245},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":364},{"uri":"Commodity","surface_form":"commodity","offset":419},{"uri":"Caffeine","surface_form":"caffeine","offset":490},{"uri":"Plant_defense_against_herbivory","surface_form":"plant defense against herbivory","offset":574},{"uri":"Soft_drink","surface_form":"soft drink","offset":750},{"uri":"Lepidoptera","surface_form":"Lepidoptera","offset":884},{"uri":"Butterfly","surface_form":"butterfly","offset":897},{"uri":"Moth","surface_form":"moth","offset":911}]}
