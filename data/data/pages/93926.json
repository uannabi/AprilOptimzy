{"id":93926,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_River","text":"The Kentucky River is a river in the state of Kentucky. It is a tributary of, or flows into, the Ohio River and is 259 miles long. The city of Frankfort is located on the Kentucky River. It is formed at Beattyville, Kentucky, which is in Lee County, which is where the North and South Forks come together.\nDescription.\nThe river is formed in eastern Kentucky at Beattyville, in Lee County, when the North, Middle and South Forks meet at about 670 feet (204 m). The river flows generally northwest, and is highly meandering in the mountains. It then flows through Daniel Boone National Forest, then past Irvine and Boonesborough, then southwest, passing south of Lexington, then north through Frankfort. It joins the Ohio at Carrollton.\nApproximately 15\u00A0mi (25\u00A0km) southwest of Boonesborough it is joined by the Red River. About 20\u00A0mi (30\u00A0km) southwest of Boonesborough it is joined by Silver Creek. At High Bridge, it is joined by the Dix River. At Frankfort, it is joined by Benson Creek. 10\u00A0mi north of Frankfort, Elkhorn Creek flows into the river.\nBetween Clays Ferry in Madison County and Frankfort, the river passes through the Kentucky River Palisades. The latter is a series of steep gorges approximately 100\u00A0mi (160\u00A0km) in length.\nAccording to Robert F. Collins of the United States Forest Service, Dr. Thomas Walker named the river, in 1750, Louisa River, after Princess Louisa, the wife of Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. Later, the name Louisa became Levisa and shifted to the nearby stream today called Levisa Fork River.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":24},{"uri":"Kentucky","surface_form":"Kentucky","offset":46},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":64},{"uri":"Ohio_River","surface_form":"Ohio River","offset":97},{"uri":"Mile","surface_form":"mile","offset":119},{"uri":"Frankfort%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Frankfort","offset":143},{"uri":"Beattyville%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Beattyville, Kentucky","offset":203},{"uri":"Lee_County","surface_form":"Lee County","offset":238},{"uri":"Beattyville%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Beattyville","offset":362},{"uri":"Lee_County%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Lee County","offset":378},{"uri":"Meander","surface_form":"meander","offset":512},{"uri":"Daniel_Boone_National_Forest","surface_form":"Daniel Boone National Forest","offset":563},{"uri":"Irvine%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Irvine","offset":603},{"uri":"Boonesborough%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Boonesborough","offset":614},{"uri":"Frankfort%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Frankfort","offset":692},{"uri":"Carrollton%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Carrollton","offset":724},{"uri":"Red_River_(Kentucky)","surface_form":"Red River","offset":811},{"uri":"Silver_Creek_(Kentucky)","surface_form":"Silver Creek","offset":885},{"uri":"High_Bridge%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"High Bridge","offset":902},{"uri":"Dix_River","surface_form":"Dix River","offset":935},{"uri":"Benson_Creek","surface_form":"Benson Creek","offset":976},{"uri":"Elkhorn_Creek","surface_form":"Elkhorn Creek","offset":1016},{"uri":"Clays_Ferry%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Clays Ferry","offset":1060},{"uri":"Madison_County%2C_Kentucky","surface_form":"Madison County","offset":1075},{"uri":"Kentucky_River_Palisades","surface_form":"Kentucky River Palisades","offset":1134},{"uri":"Gorge","surface_form":"gorge","offset":1192},{"uri":"United_States_Forest_Service","surface_form":"United States Forest Service","offset":1278},{"uri":"Thomas_Walker_(explorer)","surface_form":"Dr. Thomas Walker","offset":1308},{"uri":"Prince_William_Augustus%2C_Duke_of_Cumberland","surface_form":"Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland","offset":1401},{"uri":"Levisa_Fork_River","surface_form":"Levisa Fork River","offset":1529}]}
