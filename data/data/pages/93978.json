{"id":93978,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware","text":"Malware, short for malicious software, is a kind of software that can be installed on a computer without approval from the computer's owner. There are different kinds of malware that can hurt computers, such as viruses and Trojan horses. The term also includes other intentionally harmful programs, such as spyware and ransomware. These programs can steal passwords, delete files, collect personal information, or even stop a computer from working at all. Computer security or anti-malware software is usually good at stopping malware from installing itself. When security software is not installed, malware can get into the computer. Getting rid of malware can be difficult, even when using programs designed to remove it.\nThe term \"malware\" only refers to software that is made for malicious purposes and works against users' expectations \u2014 and so does not include applications that may do unintended harm due to some deficiency.\nHistory.\nPeople first started writing malware in the 1970s and early 1980s. Computers were very simple then. They did not have any interesting information for malware to take. Instead, people wrote malware for fun or just to show that they could. Even the most common piece of malware from this time did not do damage to people's computers. In fact, malware was so rare that the word \"malware\" was not coined until 1990.\nMore people started using the computers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Computers were getting more complex just as fast. People saw that they could use malware to get useful information now, like passwords and credit card information. So, more programmers started writing malware. The number of malware programs on the Internet has grown very quickly ever since then the late 1990s and is still growing today. Experts think that 31.5% of the world's computers have some type of malware installed.\nPurposes.\nThe main reason people write malware is to hurt others and make money, usually by stealing or deleting important information. The Cryptolocker computer virus, for example, makes it so a person cannot use their own computer until they pay the malware writers for a software key to unlock it. Another virus, CIH, tries to make it so the victim can never use their files or turn on their computer again. Malicious keystroke logging software remembers everything a user types in and gives it to the malware author to read.\nWorld governments have written malware to hurt their enemies. Experts think that the United States government made a virus named Stuxnet to stop an important place in Iran from working. The Chinese government probably used a virus to stop people from protesting its decisions.\nHow malware gets installed.\nThere are a lot of ways malware can get onto someone's computer. One common way is through email attachments. These attachments are usually sent from other computers that already have malware on them. When someone downloads and opens the attachment, the virus installs and uses their computer to send itself to even more people.\nAnother way malware installs itself is when a victim gets malware just by going to a website with the malware hidden on it. This is called drive-by downloading. A user does not have to click anything for their computer to get infected from a drive-by download. This kind of malware attack is usually found on websites that are not used a lot or whose security methods are very old. However, even current websites that people use all the time can host drive-by downloads when someone hacks the site.\nPeople who write malware also get their programs onto computers by attaching them to real programs that people want. This is most common with pirated programs. This is because the downloader was doing something illegal and cannot complain to the authorities without getting in trouble themselves. However, some non-piracy websites also put malware (or other unwanted programs that are almost as bad as malware) in a download with real, legal software in a process known as bundling. Computer security experts complain about websites that bundle real software with malware. Their complaints do not always stop the websites from bundling.\nKinds of malware.\nThere are many different kinds of malware. Each acts a different way.\nWhy computers get malware.\nThere are a few reasons why computers get programs a user didn't mean to install. One common reason is because of regular programs that have software bugs. Malware can use bugs, such as a buffer overflow, to make a program do something it was not designed to do. Malware can also get onto a computer if it tricks a user into putting it there themselves. This can happen when a user plugs in a USB flash drive that has a virus on it already. Malware also commonly uses social engineering to get users to run it, like pretending to be an important email attachment for work. Some malware even pretends to be an anti-malware program to get people to run it.\nHow malware is stopped.\nSince malware is such a big problem, many companies make programs to try to stop it. These anti-malware programs have a lot of different ways to find malware. One is static analysis, which looks at the source code of a program before it is run. Then, if the program is similar to malware the static analysis program has seen before, the anti-malware program will stop the code from running. Another way of finding malware is dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis runs only part of a program it is checking. If this part of the program tries to do anything that could be bad or harmful, the anti-malware program will not let the program run.\nMalware can also be stopped without a program. This can be done by not letting a computer connect to the Internet or other computers, called creating an air gap. However, these computers can still get malware if someone puts it there another way. One example is when someone plugs in a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive that was already plugged into a computer with a virus.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Software","surface_form":"software","offset":52},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":192},{"uri":"Computer_virus","surface_form":"viruses","offset":211},{"uri":"Trojan_horse","surface_form":"Trojan horses","offset":223},{"uri":"Spyware","surface_form":"spyware","offset":307},{"uri":"Ransomware","surface_form":"ransomware","offset":319},{"uri":"Computer_security","surface_form":"Computer security","offset":456},{"uri":"Anti-malware","surface_form":"anti-malware","offset":477},{"uri":"Neologism","surface_form":"coined","offset":1334},{"uri":"Programmer","surface_form":"programmers","offset":1601},{"uri":"Cryptolocker","surface_form":"Cryptolocker","offset":1994},{"uri":"Key_(cryptography)","surface_form":"software key","offset":2128},{"uri":"CIH","surface_form":"CIH","offset":2170},{"uri":"Keystroke_logging","surface_form":"keystroke logging","offset":2275},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":2468},{"uri":"Stuxnet","surface_form":"Stuxnet","offset":2512},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":2573},{"uri":"Email","surface_form":"email","offset":2779},{"uri":"Drive-by_download","surface_form":"drive-by downloading","offset":3156},{"uri":"Hacker","surface_form":"hacks","offset":3500},{"uri":"Software_piracy","surface_form":"pirated programs","offset":3658},{"uri":"Software_bug","surface_form":"software bugs","offset":4409},{"uri":"Buffer_overflow","surface_form":"buffer overflow","offset":4456},{"uri":"USB_flash_drive","surface_form":"USB flash drive","offset":4661},{"uri":"Social_engineering","surface_form":"social engineering","offset":4736},{"uri":"Anti-malware","surface_form":"anti-malware","offset":4877},{"uri":"Static_analysis","surface_form":"static analysis","offset":5113},{"uri":"Source_code","surface_form":"source code","offset":5149},{"uri":"Dynamic_analysis","surface_form":"dynamic analysis","offset":5372},{"uri":"Air_gap_(networking)","surface_form":"air gap","offset":5738}]}
