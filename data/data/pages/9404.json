{"id":9404,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo","text":"is a Japanese full-contact sport.\nIn sumo, a wrestler (\"rikishi\") attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (dohy\u014D) 4.55\u00A0metres in diameter. Also, the \"rikishi\" try to use their skill to force an opponent to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of his feet.\nSumo tournaments (\"basho\") take place in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka. There are a total of 6 major professional tournaments (known as \"honbasho\") per year, in January, March, May, July, September and November.\nA tournament normally lasts for 15 days and features matches from different divisions. The top 5 ranks are known as the \"Top division\", also called the \"Makuuchi\" (\u5E55\u5185) or \"Makunouchi\" (\u5E55\u306E\u5185). It is fixed in size and always contains 42 \"rikishi\".\nThe ranks included in the top division are yokozuna, ozeki, sekiwake, komusubi and maegashira.\nRikishi.\nSumo wrestlers (\"rikishi\") are ranked into a hierarchy based on win-loss statistics in competitive tournaments.\nGrand champions.\nThose who have earned the highest rank are grand champions (\"yokuzuna\").\nFor a full list of those rikishi who have held the title of \"Yokozuna\", see List of yokozuna.\nForeign-born competitors.\nSumo has changed in modern times. Foreign-born wrestlers are part of the sport. For example, Konishiki and Akebono are Hawaiian-born athletes who earned places for themselves.\nIn 2008, Kotooshu from Bulgaria won a championship. In that same year, two top wrestlers, Asashoryu and Hakuho, were Mongolian. Hakuho won the Nagoya tournament with no losses, 15-0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Japan","surface_form":"Japan","offset":5},{"uri":"Wrestler","surface_form":"wrestler","offset":45},{"uri":"Rikishi","surface_form":"rikishi","offset":56},{"uri":"Diameter","surface_form":"diameter","offset":147},{"uri":"Tournament","surface_form":"tournament","offset":294},{"uri":"Basho","surface_form":"basho","offset":308},{"uri":"Tokyo","surface_form":"Tokyo","offset":330},{"uri":"Osaka","surface_form":"Osaka","offset":337},{"uri":"Nagoya%2C_Japan","surface_form":"Nagoya","offset":344},{"uri":"Fukuoka","surface_form":"Fukuoka","offset":355},{"uri":"Honbasho","surface_form":"honbasho","offset":429},{"uri":"Rikishi","surface_form":"rikishi","offset":739},{"uri":"Yokozuna_(sumo)","surface_form":"yokozuna","offset":792},{"uri":"Ozeki","surface_form":"ozeki","offset":802},{"uri":"Sekiwake","surface_form":"sekiwake","offset":809},{"uri":"Komusubi","surface_form":"komusubi","offset":819},{"uri":"Maegashira","surface_form":"maegashira","offset":832},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchy","offset":898},{"uri":"List_of_yokozuna","surface_form":"List of yokozuna","offset":1131},{"uri":"Konishiki_Yasokichi","surface_form":"Konishiki","offset":1268},{"uri":"Bulgaria","surface_form":"Bulgaria","offset":1374},{"uri":"Mongolian_people","surface_form":"Mongolian","offset":1468}]}
