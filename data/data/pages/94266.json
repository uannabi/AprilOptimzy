{"id":94266,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory","text":"ce=\"preserve\">A dependent territory is a territory that is not fully independent or sovereign. They belong to a sovereign state, and are dependent on that state to some degree. There are varying degrees and forms of such a dependence. They are commonly distinguished from subnational entities in that they are not considered to be part of the state. A subnational entity typically represents a division of the country proper, while a dependent territory is a legally separate territory that enjoys a greater degree of autonomy.\nAs an example, Greenland is a dependent territory of Denmark, and Saint Helena is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom.\nLists of dependent territories.\nThis list includes all territories that have not been legally incorporated into their governing state, including several territories that are not on the list of non-self-governing territories of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Dependency claims without general international recognition, including all claims in Antarctica, are listed in \"italics\".\nNew Zealand.\n\"Summary:\" New Zealand has one dependent territory (Tokelau) and a \"territorial claim in Antarctica\", as well as two self-governing associated states.\nNorway.\n\"Summary:\" Norway has 1 dependent territory and \"2 dependency claims\".\nUnited Kingdom.\n\"Summary:\" the United Kingdom has 13 Overseas Territories (10 autonomous, 1 restricted to military personnel, 1 uninhabited, 1 group of Sovereign Base Areas), 3 Crown dependencies (autonomous), and \"1 dependency claim\".\nUnited States.\n\"Summary:\" the United States has 11 dependent territories and 2 dependency claims. The uninhabited Palmyra Atoll is administered similarly to some of these territories, but unlike the others is a fully incorporated part of the United States.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Territory","surface_form":"territory","offset":41},{"uri":"Independence","surface_form":"independent","offset":69},{"uri":"Sovereignty","surface_form":"sovereign","offset":84},{"uri":"Sovereign_state","surface_form":"sovereign state","offset":112},{"uri":"Dependent","surface_form":"dependent","offset":137},{"uri":"Subnational_entity","surface_form":"subnational entities","offset":272},{"uri":"Autonomy","surface_form":"autonomy","offset":518},{"uri":"Greenland","surface_form":"Greenland","offset":543},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Denmark","offset":581},{"uri":"Saint_Helena","surface_form":"Saint Helena","offset":594},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":639},{"uri":"United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories","surface_form":"list of non-self-governing territories","offset":840},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":910},{"uri":"Antarctica","surface_form":"Antarctica","offset":1011},{"uri":"New_Zealand","surface_form":"New Zealand","offset":1072},{"uri":"Tokelau","surface_form":"Tokelau","offset":1113},{"uri":"Political_status_of_the_Cook_Islands_and_Niue","surface_form":"self-governing associated states","offset":1178},{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norway","offset":1231},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1322},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1557},{"uri":"Palmyra_Atoll","surface_form":"Palmyra Atoll","offset":1641}]}
