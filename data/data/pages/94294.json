{"id":94294,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS","text":"SOCKS is an Internet protocol that allows one client computer to connect to another computer via a third computer (SOCKS server). SOCKS is an abbreviation for \"SOCKetS\".\nWhen a direct connection between two computers (clients) is not possible for some services (e.g. HTTP, FTP, or chat protocols like MSN and AOL), a user can use these services via a so-called SOCKS server (routing).\nExample: Bill wants to chat with Jane. Bill has a bad service provider who limits internet access. Bill's computer then connects to the SOCKS server, which is able to \"chat\" with Jane's computer without restrictions.\nAn HTTP proxy works similar to a SOCKS server, but is limited on routing HTTP traffic only.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":12},{"uri":"Protocol","surface_form":"protocol","offset":21},{"uri":"Client","surface_form":"client","offset":46},{"uri":"HTTP","surface_form":"HTTP","offset":267},{"uri":"FTP","surface_form":"FTP","offset":273},{"uri":"MSN","surface_form":"MSN","offset":301},{"uri":"AOL","surface_form":"AOL","offset":309},{"uri":"Proxy","surface_form":"proxy","offset":610}]}
