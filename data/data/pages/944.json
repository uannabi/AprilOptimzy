{"id":944,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year","text":"e=\"preserve\">One year is about 365 days long (except in a leap year). It is the time it takes the Earth to go completely around (orbit) the sun once. A year is actually 365.2422 days long, but a calendar has 365 days, except in a leap year.\nThe year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the Gregorian calendar, but a fiscal year or a school year can start on a different day of the year.\nThere are several ways used to measure the length of a year.\nSolar and lunar years are used by different calendars for daily life. The other measurements are used by astronomers.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Day","surface_form":"day","offset":35},{"uri":"Leap_year","surface_form":"leap year","offset":58},{"uri":"Earth","surface_form":"Earth","offset":98},{"uri":"Orbit","surface_form":"orbit","offset":129},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"sun","offset":140},{"uri":"Fraction_(mathematics)","surface_form":".2422","offset":172},{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":195},{"uri":"Gregorian_calendar","surface_form":"Gregorian calendar","offset":301},{"uri":"Fiscal_year","surface_form":"fiscal year","offset":327},{"uri":"School_year","surface_form":"school year","offset":344},{"uri":"Calendar","surface_form":"calendar","offset":503},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":564}]}
