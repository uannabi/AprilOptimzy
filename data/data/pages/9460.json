{"id":9460,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song","text":"=\"preserve\">A song is a piece of music which contains words. Songs may be made by songwriter<nowiki/>s. Other songs are folk songs, which are songs created by people long ago that have been sung as tradition.\nSome people form bands which write and record songs to make money from it. When two or three singers sing the song it is called a duet or trio. Some people also make parodies of songs, which is usually changing the words of the song but keeping the tune. Parodies are usually made to make fun of a song or its writer/singer (parody artist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic is an example of this).\nThe word \"song\" is often used to describe any piece of music, even one without words or lyrics. The proper word for a piece of music without words is \"instrumental\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Music","surface_form":"music","offset":33},{"uri":"Songwriter","surface_form":"songwriter","offset":82},{"uri":"Folk_song","surface_form":"folk song","offset":120},{"uri":"Tradition","surface_form":"tradition","offset":198},{"uri":"Band","surface_form":"band","offset":226},{"uri":"Money","surface_form":"money","offset":269},{"uri":"Duet","surface_form":"duet","offset":339},{"uri":"Trio_(music)","surface_form":"trio","offset":347},{"uri":"Parody","surface_form":"parodies","offset":375},{"uri":"%26quot%3BWeird_Al%26quot%3B_Yankovic","surface_form":"\"Weird Al\" Yankovic","offset":548},{"uri":"Instrumental","surface_form":"instrumental","offset":743}]}
