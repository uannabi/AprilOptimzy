Carson, McMahon, and Severinsen retired from \"The Tonight Show\" in 1992, when Jay Leno became host. Leno left the show in 2009, and Conan O'Brien (of \"Late Night\" and \"Saturday Night Live\" fame) became host from June 2009 to January 2010 before leaving due to controversy with \"The Tonight Shows timeslot. Jay Leno became the host of the show again on March 1, 2010.

The \"Jay Leno Show\" would be 30 minutes long. \"The Tonight Show\" would be moved to 12:05 AM, but would still be a full hour long. NBC did this because Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien were not getting enough viewers, and they believed that moving \"The Jay Leno Show\" to late night would increase their prime time viewers.\nAfter being told this, Conan O'Brien said that he would be leaving \"The Tonight Show\". He said that he believed that moving the show to 12:05 would ruin it, and that it would be unfair to \"Late Night\", which would have been moved to 1:05 AM. The deal was made that O'Brien would receive $33 million and that his staff of almost 200 people would receive $12 million. Conan O'Brien's last show aired on January 22, 2010.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Popularity","surface_form":"popular","offset":24},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":43},{"uri":"Talk_show","surface_form":"talk","offset":54},{"uri":"Comedy","surface_form":"comedy","offset":63},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":82},{"uri":"National_Broadcasting_Company","surface_form":"NBC","offset":115},{"uri":"Television_network","surface_form":"television network","offset":119},{"uri":"Steve_Allen","surface_form":"Steve Allen","offset":182},{"uri":"Jack_Paar","surface_form":"Jack Paar","offset":204},{"uri":"Ernie_Kovacs","surface_form":"Ernie Kovacs","offset":236},{"uri":"Johnny_Carson","surface_form":"Johnny Carson","offset":282},{"uri":"Ed_McMahon","surface_form":"Ed McMahon","offset":344},{"uri":"Doc_Severinsen","surface_form":"Doc Severinsen","offset":372},{"uri":"Jay_Leno","surface_form":"Jay Leno","offset":480},{"uri":"Conan_O%27Brien","surface_form":"Conan O'Brien","offset":534},{"uri":"Late_Night","surface_form":"Late Night","offset":553},{"uri":"Saturday_Night_Live","surface_form":"Saturday Night Live","offset":570},{"uri":"Jimmy_Fallon","surface_form":"Jimmy Fallon","offset":795},{"uri":"Jay_Leno_Show","surface_form":"Jay Leno Show","offset":900},{"uri":"Prime_time","surface_form":"prime time","offset":1273}]}
