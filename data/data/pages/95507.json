{"id":95507,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Lie","text":"Trygve Halvdan Lie () (16 July 1896 \u2013 30 December 1968) was a Norwegian politician. From 1946 to 1952 he was the first elected Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nEarly life.\nLie was born in Oslo (then Kristiania) on 16 July 1896. He joined the Labour Party in 1911 and was named as the party's national secretary soon after getting his law degree from the University of Oslo in 1919. He married Hj\u00F8rdis J\u00F8rgensen in 1921; the couple had three daughters, Sissel, Guri, and Mette.\nPolitical career.\nLater he was elected to the Storting (Norway's Parliament). He was appointed Minister of Justice when a Labour Party government was formed by Johan Nygaardsvold in 1935. Lie was later named Minister of Trade and Industries and Minister of Supply and Shipping.\nIn 1940, when Norway was invaded by Germany, Lie ordered all Norwegian ships to sail to Allied ports. Lie was named as Foreign Minister of the Norwegian government-in-exile.\nSelection as UN Secretary General.\nLie led the Norwegian \"delegation\" (group) to the United Nations conference in San Francisco in 1946 and was a leader in drafting the rules to set up the United Nations Security Council. He was the leader of the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations general assembly in 1946. On February 1, 1946, he was elected as the first United Nations Secretary-General as a result of a compromise between the major powers, having only missed being elected President of the first General Assembly by a small margin. He gets much of the credit for securing the current site for the United Nations headquarters from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and establishing the offices there.\nAs Secretary General.\nAs Secretary General, Lie supported the foundation of Israel and Indonesia. He worked for the withdrawal of Soviet forces in Iran and a stop to fighting in Kashmir. He attracted the anger of the Soviet Union when he helped gather support for the defence of South Korea after it was invaded in 1950 and later worked to end the Soviet boycott of UN meetings, though his involvement has only little to do with the eventual return of the Soviet Union to the UN. He was opposed to Spain's entry into the United Nations because of his opposition to the Franco government. He also sought to have the People's Republic of China recognized by the United Nations after the Nationalist government was exiled to Taiwan, arguing that the People's Republic was the only government which could fulfill the membership obligations in full. This did not happen until the 1970s.\nHe has been criticized for his failures to facilitate negotiation in the Berlin Blockade, as well as his failure to bring about a more swift end to the Korean War. His critics argue that he was under the influence of a select few in the UN Secretariat. He has also been criticized for his arrogance and stubbornness.\nOver objections from the Soviet Union, his term of office was extended by the General Assembly 46 - 5 in 1950. This was the result of a Security Council impasse, in which the US refused to accept any candidate but Lie, and the Soviet Union's absolute refusal to accept him again, due to his involvement in the Korean War. The Soviet Union refused to acknowledge him as secretary general in his second term, and after having been accused by Joseph McCarthy of hiring \"disloyal\" Americans (an allegation which he attributed to the rapid hiring of civil servants necessary after the creation of the organization), Lie resigned on November 10, 1952.\nLater life.\nLie remained active in Norwegian politics after his resignation from the UN. He was the Governor of Oslo and Akershus, Chairman of the Board of Energy, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of Trade.\nDeath.\nLie died on December 30, 1968 of a heart attack. He was 72 years old.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Norway","surface_form":"Norwegian","offset":62},{"uri":"United_Nations_Secretary-General","surface_form":"Secretary-General","offset":127},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":152},{"uri":"Oslo","surface_form":"Oslo","offset":196},{"uri":"Norwegian_Labour_Party","surface_form":"Labour Party","offset":250},{"uri":"University_of_Oslo","surface_form":"University of Oslo","offset":362},{"uri":"Storting","surface_form":"Storting","offset":531},{"uri":"Johan_Nygaardsvold","surface_form":"Johan Nygaardsvold","offset":645},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":799},{"uri":"United_Nations","surface_form":"United Nations","offset":1022},{"uri":"San_Francisco","surface_form":"San Francisco","offset":1051},{"uri":"United_Nations_Security_Council","surface_form":"United Nations Security Council","offset":1126},{"uri":"United_Nations_Secretary-General","surface_form":"United Nations Secretary-General","offset":1302},{"uri":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","surface_form":"General Assembly","offset":1445},{"uri":"John_D._Rockefeller%2C_Jr.","surface_form":"John D.
