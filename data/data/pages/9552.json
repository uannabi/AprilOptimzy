{"id":9552,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot","text":"Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch is a creature in folklore. People say that they are primates living in remote areas of Canada and the United States. Even though many people claim to have seen a Bigfoot, or seen their tracks, no one has ever captured one, or found a dead body. So, most people do not believe in Bigfoot. Bigfoot is said to be very tall, from 7 to 9 feet (about 2 to 2.75 meters) and covered in brown, black, red, or sometimes even white fur or hair. They are said to have very big feet, about 13 inches long (0.3 meters), which is why they are named Bigfoot.\nBigfoot is similar to another mythical creature, the Yeti of the Himalayas.\nThe name Sasquatch comes from the Halkomelem language, a Central Salish language in the Salish language family. Stories of this type of creature are known among a number of First Nations groups in south-western British Columbia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Folklore","surface_form":"folklore","offset":48},{"uri":"Primate","surface_form":"primate","offset":83},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":118},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":133},{"uri":"Yeti","surface_form":"Yeti","offset":627},{"uri":"Himalayas","surface_form":"Himalayas","offset":639},{"uri":"First_Nations","surface_form":"First Nations","offset":823},{"uri":"British_Columbia","surface_form":"British Columbia","offset":861}]}
