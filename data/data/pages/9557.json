This book was based on some papers found in the National Library of France, and which were forgeries. The papers were written to show that the man who wrote them was really the true king of France and head of an ancient secret society.\nIn 2006, Columbia Pictures made a movie version. It was directed by Ron Howard and stars Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dan_Brown","surface_form":"Dan Brown","offset":38},{"uri":"Opus_Dei","surface_form":"Opus Dei","offset":95},{"uri":"Leonardo_da_Vinci","surface_form":"Leonardo da Vinci","offset":127},{"uri":"Mona_Lisa","surface_form":"Mona Lisa","offset":191},{"uri":"The_Last_Supper_(da_Vinci)","surface_form":"The Last Supper","offset":205},{"uri":"Columbia_Pictures","surface_form":"Columbia Pictures","offset":642},{"uri":"The_Da_Vinci_Code_(movie)","surface_form":"a movie version","offset":665},{"uri":"Movie_director","surface_form":"directed by","offset":689},{"uri":"Ron_Howard","surface_form":"Ron Howard","offset":701},{"uri":"Tom_Hanks","surface_form":"Tom Hanks","offset":722}]}
