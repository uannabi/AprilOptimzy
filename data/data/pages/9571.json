{"id":9571,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False","text":"=\"preserve\">False means untrue. If something is false, it means it is not real. A falsehood is anything said that is not true. A falsehood can also be a series of lies, told to \"prove\" something that is false itself.\nIn logic, \"false\" is one of the truth values (with the other one being 'true'). This is written as formula_1, F or 0.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Untrue","surface_form":"untrue","offset":24},{"uri":"Real","surface_form":"real","offset":74},{"uri":"True","surface_form":"true","offset":121},{"uri":"Lie","surface_form":"lie","offset":163},{"uri":"Logic","surface_form":"logic","offset":220},{"uri":"Truth_value","surface_form":"truth values","offset":249}]}
