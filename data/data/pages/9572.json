{"id":9572,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology","text":"Marine biology is the study of any living plant or animal in the sea. Marine biologists are the people who study it. Like other scientists, marine biologists must know a lot about the creatures they are studying. They also must understand how the sea works. The study of how the sea works is oceanography.\nMarine animals include squids, corals, whales and fish. Marine plants include sea grasses and algae. The Census of Marine Life was a ten-year project of marine biology.\nDuring the Age of Discovery many more ships sailed far from home. Captain James Cook. He went around the would twice while finding new discoveries. Another person who helped is Charles Darwin, known for the Theory of Evolution. He helped a lot in marine biology. His expeditions aboard the HMS Beagle from 1831-1836 to collect marine organisms.\nOne marine animal that is regularly seen in this position is called the lion fish also known as the zebra fish, fire fish, turkey fish, or butterfly cod. It has a pattern of red, white, cream, or black stripes. This fish is an invasive species. This means that it should not be in as many waters as it is. Another animal is the clownfish is usually orange, or yellow, and black and white stripes. They are part of the Amphiprioninae family. Both of these animals are examples of the life in the ocean or sea.\nHabitats.\nOne of the many habitats in the vast ocean is the coral reef. Coral reefs are very colorful.\nMarine biologist.\nPrevious education is a bachelor's degree in biology, followed by at least an MSc in marine biology.\nThe ocean is large and marine biologists work in many subfields like zoology, invertebrate, ichthyology, and physiology. Other subfields study physical traits like scales, scales, or eyes. Biologists also study animal behavior.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"study","offset":22},{"uri":"Life","surface_form":"living","offset":35},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":51},{"uri":"Sea","surface_form":"sea","offset":65},{"uri":"Ocean","surface_form":"Marine","offset":70},{"uri":"Biologist","surface_form":"biologist","offset":77},{"uri":"Oceanography","surface_form":"oceanography","offset":292},{"uri":"Squid","surface_form":"squid","offset":329},{"uri":"Coral","surface_form":"coral","offset":337},{"uri":"Whale","surface_form":"whale","offset":345},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":356},{"uri":"Sea_grass","surface_form":"sea grass","offset":384},{"uri":"Algae","surface_form":"algae","offset":400},{"uri":"Census_of_Marine_Life","surface_form":"Census of Marine Life","offset":411},{"uri":"Age_of_Discovery","surface_form":"Age of Discovery","offset":486},{"uri":"James_Cook","surface_form":"James Cook","offset":549},{"uri":"Evolution","surface_form":"Evolution","offset":692},{"uri":"Coral_reef","surface_form":"Coral reef","offset":1401},{"uri":"Bachelor%27s_degree","surface_form":"bachelor's degree","offset":1474},{"uri":"MSc","surface_form":"MSc","offset":1528},{"uri":"Animal_behavior","surface_form":"animal behavior","offset":1762}]}
