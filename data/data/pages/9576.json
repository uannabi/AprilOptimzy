{"id":9576,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi","text":"Burundi (officially called the Republic of Burundi) is a small country in Africa. The capital of Burundi is Gitega. The official languages of Burundi are Kirundi French and English. There are about eight and a half million people in Burundi. Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world.\nProvinces, communes and collines.\nBurundi is divided into 18 provinces, 117 communes, and 2,638 collines (hills). Provincial governments are based on these boundaries. In 2000, the province encompassing Bujumbura was separated into two provinces, Bujumbura Rural and Bunjumbura Mairie.\nGeography.\nOne of the smallest countries in Africa, Burundi is landlocked. It is bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. It has an equatorial climate. Burundi is a part of the Albertine Rift, the western extension of the East African Rift.\nThe country lies on a rolling plateau in the center of Africa. The average elevation of the central plateau is, with lower elevations at the borders. The highest peak, Mount Heha at, is southeast of Bujumbura. The source of the Nile River is in Burundi province. It is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters by the Ruvyironza River. Lake Victoria is also an important water source. It serves as a fork to the Kagera River. Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika in Burundi's southwestern corner.\nBurundi's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture. Settlement by rural populations has led to deforestation, soil erosion, and habitat loss.\nThere are two national parks: Kibira National Park and Ruvubu National Park. Both were formed in 1982 to keep wildlife populations.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Country","surface_form":"country","offset":63},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":74},{"uri":"Gitega","surface_form":"Gitega","offset":108},{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":129},{"uri":"Kirundi","surface_form":"Kirundi","offset":154},{"uri":"French_language","surface_form":"French","offset":162},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":173},{"uri":"Provinces","surface_form":"provinces","offset":357},{"uri":"Communes_of_Burundi","surface_form":"communes","offset":372},{"uri":"Collines_of_Burundi","surface_form":"collines","offset":392},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":626},{"uri":"Landlocked","surface_form":"landlocked","offset":645},{"uri":"Albertine_Rift","surface_form":"Albertine Rift","offset":836},{"uri":"East_African_Rift","surface_form":"East African Rift","offset":881},{"uri":"Plateau","surface_form":"plateau","offset":930},{"uri":"Mount_Heha","surface_form":"Mount Heha","offset":1068},{"uri":"Nile_River","surface_form":"Nile River","offset":1128},{"uri":"Ruvyironza_River","surface_form":"Ruvyironza River","offset":1220},{"uri":"Lake_Victoria","surface_form":"Lake Victoria","offset":1238},{"uri":"Kagera_River","surface_form":"Kagera River","offset":1314},{"uri":"Lake_Tanganyika","surface_form":"Lake Tanganyika","offset":1350},{"uri":"Agricultural","surface_form":"agricultural","offset":1427},{"uri":"Pasture","surface_form":"pasture","offset":1443},{"uri":"Deforestation","surface_form":"deforestation","offset":1495},{"uri":"Soil_erosion","surface_form":"soil erosion","offset":1510},{"uri":"Habitat_loss","surface_form":"habitat loss","offset":1528},{"uri":"National_park","surface_form":"national park","offset":1556},{"uri":"Kibira_National_Park","surface_form":"Kibira National Park","offset":1572},{"uri":"Ruvubu_National_Park","surface_form":"Ruvubu National Park","offset":1597}]}
