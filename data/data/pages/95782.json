Over 11 million Uyghurs live there, more than any other part of the world. Some Uyghurs seek independence from China.\nUyghurs also live in Beijing, Shanghai and Taoyuan County (Hunan, South-Central China). There are Uyghur diasporic communities in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Mongolia.\nThey are mainly Muslim and speak Uyghur, a Turkic language. They write in the Uyghur alphabet, which is based on the Arabic alphabet.\nUyghurs were originally from Mongolia and immigrated to Xinjiang during the 8th or 9th centuries AD. There they mixed with local Indo-European people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["ethnic group"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chinese_people","surface_form":"Chinese","offset":32},{"uri":"Turkic_peoples","surface_form":"Turkic people","offset":40},{"uri":"Xinjiang","surface_form":"Xinjiang","offset":71},{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":81},{"uri":"Beijing","surface_form":"Beijing","offset":227},{"uri":"Shanghai","surface_form":"Shanghai","offset":236},{"uri":"Taoyuan_County%2C_Hunan","surface_form":"Taoyuan County","offset":249},{"uri":"Hunan","surface_form":"Hunan","offset":265},{"uri":"Diaspora","surface_form":"diasporic","offset":311},{"uri":"Turkey","surface_form":"Turkey","offset":336},{"uri":"Kazakhstan","surface_form":"Kazakhstan","offset":344},{"uri":"Kyrgyzstan","surface_form":"Kyrgyzstan","offset":356},{"uri":"Uzbekistan","surface_form":"Uzbekistan","offset":368},{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":380},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":393},{"uri":"Muslim","surface_form":"Muslim","offset":419},{"uri":"Uyghur_language","surface_form":"Uyghur","offset":436},{"uri":"Turkic_languages","surface_form":"Turkic language","offset":446},{"uri":"Uighur_alphabet","surface_form":"Uyghur alphabet","offset":481},{"uri":"Arabic_alphabet","surface_form":"Arabic alphabet","offset":520},{"uri":"Mongolia","surface_form":"Mongolia","offset":566},{"uri":"AD","surface_form":"AD","offset":634},{"uri":"Indo-European_people","surface_form":"Indo-European people","offset":666}]}
