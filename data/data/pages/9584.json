{"id":9584,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital","text":"A hospital is a place where a person goes to be healed when he or she is sick or injured. The difference between a hospital and other healthcare places like a clinic or a doctor's office is that a hospital will have beds where patients can stay overnight. These patients are called \"inpatients\". Hospitals also treat people who do not stay overnight, called \"outpatients\". Doctors and nurses work at hospitals. Doctors make use of advanced medical technology to heal patients.\nThe word hospital originally meant \"a place where people can stay\". There have been hospitals for sick people since ancient times. They were often created and run by religious groups. In the early modern period, hospitals began to be funded by donations from rich people and by governments. Today, hospitals may get money from the government, from charging patients for the treatments and check-ups, from patients' health insurance, from people giving to charity or a mix of those things.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Clinic","surface_form":"clinic","offset":159},{"uri":"Doctor%27s_office","surface_form":"doctor's office","offset":171},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"Doctors","offset":373},{"uri":"Nurse","surface_form":"nurse","offset":385},{"uri":"Early_modern_period","surface_form":"early modern period","offset":668},{"uri":"Insurance","surface_form":"health insurance","offset":892},{"uri":"Charity_(practice)","surface_form":"people giving to charity","offset":915}]}
