In all these countries, Berneri was frequently placed under arrest, and then often expelled, because he was an anarchist. When he was in these countries he wrote lot of anti-clerical and anti-fascist articles.\nWith Carlo Rosselli, Berneri organized the first troop (column) of Italian volunteers to fight in the Spanish Civil War against Francisco Franco. After months he became highly critical of the involvement of Confederaci\u00F3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) members in the Popular Front government, and he sent a letter to Federica Montseny (Anarchist minister for Health in the government against fascism).\nDuring the Barcelona May Days, as troop of Communist Party of Spain members (apparently under orders from Joseph Stalin) searched and then murdered him. His body, riddled with bullets, was found during the night, near the headquarters of the Generalitat de Catalunya.\nHe was married to Giovanna Berneri and was father of Marie-Louise Berneri and Giliane Berneri. The children were anarchists as the father Camillo.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"1877","surface_form":"1877","offset":48},{"uri":"Lodi%2C_Italy","surface_form":"Lodi","offset":54},{"uri":"May_5","surface_form":"May 5","offset":59},{"uri":"1937","surface_form":"1937","offset":65},{"uri":"Barcelona","surface_form":"Barcelona","offset":71},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":89},{"uri":"Philosophy","surface_form":"philosophy","offset":110},{"uri":"Anarchist","surface_form":"anarchist","offset":122},{"uri":"Militant","surface_form":"militant","offset":132},{"uri":"Propagandist","surface_form":"propagandist","offset":142},{"uri":"Theorist","surface_form":"theorist","offset":159},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":180},{"uri":"University_of_Florence","surface_form":"University of Florence","offset":201},{"uri":"Humanities","surface_form":"humanities","offset":237},{"uri":"Unione_Anarchica_Italiana","surface_form":"Unione Anarchica Italiana","offset":269},{"uri":"Fascism","surface_form":"Fascists","offset":310},{"uri":"1926","surface_form":"1926","offset":358},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":398},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":419},{"uri":"Switzerland","surface_form":"Switzerland","offset":432},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":445},{"uri":"Belgium","surface_form":"Belgium","offset":454},{"uri":"Luxembourg","surface_form":"Luxembourg","offset":463},{"uri":"Netherlands","surface_form":"Netherlands","offset":491},{"uri":"Expelled","surface_form":"expelled","offset":587},{"uri":"Anti-clericalism","surface_form":"anti-clerical","offset":673},{"uri":"Anti-fascism","surface_form":"anti-fascist","offset":691},{"uri":"Carlo_Rosselli","surface_form":"Carlo Rosselli","offset":719},{"uri":"Volunteers","surface_form":"volunteers","offset":789},{"uri":"Spanish_Civil_War","surface_form":"Spanish Civil War","offset":816},{"uri":"Francisco_Franco","surface_form":"Francisco Franco","offset":842},{"uri":"Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo","surface_form":"Confederaci\u00F3n Nacional del Trabajo","offset":921},{"uri":"Popular_Front_(Spain)","surface_form":"Popular Front","offset":977},{"uri":"Federica_Montseny","surface_form":"Federica Montseny","offset":1027},{"uri":"Barcelona_May_Days","surface_form":"Barcelona May Days","offset":1123},{"uri":"Communist_Party_of_Spain","surface_form":"Communist Party of Spain","offset":1155},{"uri":"Joseph_Stalin","surface_form":"Joseph Stalin","offset":1218},{"uri":"Bullets","surface_form":"bullets","offset":1288},{"uri":"Headquarters","surface_form":"headquarters","offset":1334},{"uri":"Generalitat_de_Catalunya","surface_form":"Generalitat de Catalunya","offset":1354},{"uri":"Giovanna_Berneri","surface_form":"Giovanna Berneri","offset":1398},{"uri":"Marie-Louise_Berneri","surface_form":"Marie-Louise Berneri","offset":1433},{"uri":"Giliane_Berneri","surface_form":"Giliane Berneri","offset":1458}]}
