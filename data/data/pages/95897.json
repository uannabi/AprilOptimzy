He was one of the founders of \"La Questione Sociale\", the Italian language anarchist paper published in Paterson.\nIn 1898, the high bread prices led to demonstrations all over Italy. In Milan, an unarmed group of workers, women and children marched together for protesting, near the palace, which was surrounded by a strong military force under command of General Fiorenzo Bava-Beccaris. The people ignored the order to stop, so the General gave the signal of fire with rifles and cannons, resulting in a massacre of innocent people. Ninety people died, one of whom was Bresci's sister.\nUmberto I's killing.\nKing Humbert later decorated Bava-Beccaris, and the king after said thanks to him,for \"the defense of the royal house\", the king did not do anything for the innocent people died, he decorated the murtder, this is the reason that made Bresci determined to kill the king.Bresci had his loan to the paper returned (without telling his comrades why), and with the money he went to Italy.
