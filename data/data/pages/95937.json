{"id":95937,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitnerium","text":"=\"preserve\">Meitnerium is a chemical element in the periodic table. Its atomic number is 109. It is not found on earth naturally. Because of this, it needs to be made in a science laboratory. Its half life, or the amount of time it takes for half of the element to go away is a little over one second. Meitnerium was first made in 1982.\nThe element is named in honor of Lise Meitner (1878-1968).\nThe two letter abbreviation is \"Mt\" and is a solid. Nobody knows for sure what meitnerium looks like, but scientists think it is a white, gray, or silver color.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Chemical_element","surface_form":"chemical element","offset":28},{"uri":"Periodic_table","surface_form":"periodic table","offset":52},{"uri":"Atomic_number","surface_form":"atomic number","offset":72},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":180},{"uri":"Lise_Meitner","surface_form":"Lise Meitner","offset":370},{"uri":"Abbreviation","surface_form":"abbreviation","offset":411},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":441}]}
