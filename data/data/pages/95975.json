{"id":95975,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Ocoa","text":"The River Ocoa is a river in the southern side of the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. It is 68\u00A0km long and flows through mountains except near its end in the Caribbean Sea.\nName.\nOcoa is a Ta\u00EDno word that means \"a place with mountains\"; \"coa\" meant \"place\" and \"o\" meant, in some cases, \"mountain\".\nCourse.\nThe source of the Ocoa is at the La Chorreosa mountain (also known as La Chorriosa), on the eastern side of Valle Nuevo (Cordillera Central). It flows through the San Jos\u00E9 de Ocoa province and then form part of the limits between the Azua and Peravia provinces.\nIt ends at the eastern side of Ocoa Bay, on the Caribbean Sea.\nThe city of San Jos\u00E9 de Ocoa is the most important city near the river. Other towns are Las Carreras, Sabana Buey and Villa Fundaci\u00F3n, in the Peravia province, and Palmar de Ocoa in the Azua province, near its mouth. The water of the river is used for irrigation in those towns; it is not used for the houses because it has too much solid materials because mountains have very few trees.\nThe most important tributaries are Banilejo, Canal and Arroyo Parra, all in the higher part of the river. There is not any important tributary in the lower part.\nIn history.\nIn the 16th century, sugar cane was grown near the mouth of the river to produce sugar.\nOn April 1849, there was an important battle (the \"Battle of Las Carreras\") here during the Dominican-Haitian War; the fight was on the western side of the river in Las Carreras, a place at about 20\u00A0km from the mouth. The Dominican army won the battle against the Haitian army.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"River","surface_form":"river","offset":20},{"uri":"Cordillera_Central_(Hispaniola)","surface_form":"Cordillera Central","offset":54},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican Republic","offset":74},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":166},{"uri":"Ta%C3%ADno","surface_form":"Ta\u00EDno","offset":197},{"uri":"Source_(river_or_stream)","surface_form":"source","offset":319},{"uri":"Cordillera_Central_(Hispaniola)","surface_form":"Cordillera Central","offset":436},{"uri":"San_Jos%C3%A9_de_Ocoa_Province","surface_form":"San Jos\u00E9 de Ocoa","offset":478},{"uri":"Azua_Province","surface_form":"Azua","offset":549},{"uri":"Peravia_Province","surface_form":"Peravia","offset":558},{"uri":"Ocoa_Bay","surface_form":"Ocoa Bay","offset":608},{"uri":"San_Jos%C3%A9_de_Ocoa_(city)","surface_form":"San Jos\u00E9 de Ocoa","offset":652},{"uri":"Peravia_Province","surface_form":"Peravia","offset":782},{"uri":"Azua_Province","surface_form":"Azua","offset":826},{"uri":"Irrigation","surface_form":"irrigation","offset":892},{"uri":"Solid","surface_form":"solid","offset":973},{"uri":"Material","surface_form":"material","offset":979},{"uri":"Tree","surface_form":"tree","offset":1021},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributaries","offset":1047},{"uri":"Tributary","surface_form":"tributary","offset":1161},{"uri":"Sugar_cane","surface_form":"sugar cane","offset":1223},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":1283},{"uri":"April","surface_form":"April","offset":1293},{"uri":"1849","surface_form":"1849","offset":1299},{"uri":"Battle","surface_form":"battle","offset":1328},{"uri":"Battle_of_Las_Carreras","surface_form":"Battle of Las Carreras","offset":1341},{"uri":"Dominican-Haitian_War","surface_form":"Dominican-Haitian War","offset":1382},{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican","offset":1512},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":1554}]}
