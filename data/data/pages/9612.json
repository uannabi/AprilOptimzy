In the 1880s, the famous painters, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin lived there. Vincent van Gogh painted his famous Sunflowers in Arles.\nThe city is at the heart of the Camargue. Not many people live in this region, so there is a lot of free land around Arles. Because of this, Arles is the city in France to have the largest area (nearly 760 square kilometres).","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":32},{"uri":"1880s","surface_form":"1880s","offset":139},{"uri":"Vincent_van_Gogh","surface_form":"Vincent van Gogh","offset":167},{"uri":"Paul_Gauguin","surface_form":"Paul Gauguin","offset":188},{"uri":"Vincent_van_Gogh","surface_form":"Vincent van Gogh","offset":214},{"uri":"Camargue","surface_form":"Camargue","offset":303},{"uri":"France","surface_form":"France","offset":433}]}
