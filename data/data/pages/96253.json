{"id":96253,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skol","text":"e=\"preserve\">Skol is a brand of beer made by the Danish company Carlsberg Group. Skol was first brewed in 1959 for European customers. The beer's name comes from the Danish word \"sk\u00E5l\" which means \"to your health\", a common toast (a word or phrase said before drinking). Skol is available in a few different flavors.\nSkol was started in 1964 in Europe. It became available in Brazil in 1967. In 1979, it was one of the first beers to be sold in aluminum cans. As of 2004, Skol was available in more than 20 countries.\nIn 2000, the first annual Skol Beats music festival was held in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. The type of music featured at Skol Beats is electronic, including trance, techno, electro, drum and bass, house, and breakbeat. Skol's new \"Beats\" beer was revealed at the 2000 festival. Beats has a different flavor and alcohol content than the original Skol. It is marketed as the beer for people that like parties and excitement.\nIn October of 2006, the new Skol Lemon was released. Response to Skol Lemon has been divided. Some people really like it and others do not.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Beer","surface_form":"beer","offset":32},{"uri":"Denmark","surface_form":"Danish","offset":49},{"uri":"Carlsberg_Group","surface_form":"Carlsberg Group","offset":64},{"uri":"Brew","surface_form":"brew","offset":96},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":115},{"uri":"Danish_language","surface_form":"Danish","offset":166},{"uri":"Europe","surface_form":"Europe","offset":345},{"uri":"Brazil","surface_form":"Brazil","offset":376},{"uri":"Aluminum","surface_form":"aluminum","offset":445},{"uri":"S%C3%A3o_Paulo","surface_form":"S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil","offset":582},{"uri":"Trance_music","surface_form":"trance","offset":667},{"uri":"Techno","surface_form":"techno","offset":675},{"uri":"Electro_music","surface_form":"electro","offset":683},{"uri":"Drum_and_bass","surface_form":"drum and bass","offset":692},{"uri":"House_music","surface_form":"house","offset":707},{"uri":"Breakbeat","surface_form":"breakbeat","offset":718}]}
