{"id":96336,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Haider","text":"J\u00F6rg Haider (26 January 1950 \u2013 11 October, 2008) was an Austrian politician who was often called to be off right-populism (\"rechtspopulist\"). He was born in Bad Goisern, Upper Austria, and died near Klagenfurt, Austria.\nAt the age of 29 he became the youngest member of the Austrian parliament and in 1989 the Governor of Carinthia for the first time.\nHaider lead the Freedom Party to great success so that in 1999 the party reached the second most votes with 27% behind the SP\u00D6 with 33% and could form a coalition with the Austrian People's Party \u00D6VP (having for the first time only the third most votes) making Wolfgang Sch\u00FCssel Chancellor of Austria.\nHaider passed his leading position to other party members so that a coalition could take place and returned to Carinthia to work as Governor again.\nIn 2004 Haider was re-elected as Governor of Carinthia. One year later the leading members of the FP\u00D6 as well as there party members in the government together with J\u00F6rg Haider (as their new head) founded a new Party, the BZ\u00D6. In 2006 the BZ\u00D6 party reached the 4% (that time lead under P. Westenthaler) in the Austrian elections and so became part of the Parliament with 7 representatives. For the snap elections in September 2008 he was voted unanimity in his party for the leading position and ran as candidate again for the elections like back in the nineties. Surprisingly the party gained 10.7% and therefore could rise its seats 3 times now having 21 representatives under the lead of J\u00F6rg Haider. However Haider promised before the votes toke place too remain Governor as he would have only changed as of becoming Chancellor. There were possibilities to build a government with J\u00F6rg Haider as chancellor (Haider already achieved to form a coalition where the \u00D6VP under Sch\u00FCssel with the 3rd most votes got the Chancellor) or at least the BZ\u00D6 represented in the government. For this a coalition of BZ\u00D6 with FP\u00D6 and \u00D6VP was necessary, however Haider never got into this position.\nOn 11 October 2008, Haider died in a traffic accident near the town of Klagenfurt. He was returning home after an event that had taken place earlier. Many people living in Carinthia in reaction to his death, left public offerings as flowers, candles, cards and personal messages, Austrian singer and intendant Harald Serafin called the tragic death even an \"Austro-Lady-Diana-Story\".","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Officeholder"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":56},{"uri":"Popular","surface_form":"populism","offset":113},{"uri":"Upper_Austria","surface_form":"Upper Austria","offset":170},{"uri":"Carinthia_(state)","surface_form":"Carinthia","offset":322},{"uri":"SP%C3%96","surface_form":"SP\u00D6","offset":475},{"uri":"%C3%96VP","surface_form":"\u00D6VP","offset":548},{"uri":"Wolfgang_Sch%C3%BCssel","surface_form":"Wolfgang Sch\u00FCssel","offset":613},{"uri":"Chancellor_of_Austria","surface_form":"Chancellor of Austria","offset":631},{"uri":"BZ%C3%96","surface_form":"BZ\u00D6","offset":1024},{"uri":"Unanimity","surface_form":"unanimity","offset":1246},{"uri":"Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales","surface_form":"Lady-Diana","offset":2352}]}
