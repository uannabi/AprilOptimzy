Paleolithic stone axes, and Neolithic and Bronze Age pots have been found in the area. Canterbury was once the main settlement of the Celtic tribe of the Cantiaci, which lived in most of modern-day Kent. In the 1st century AD, the Romans captured the settlement and named it Durovernum Cantiacorum. The Romans rebuilt the city, with new streets in a grid pattern, a theatre, a temple, a forum, and public baths. Its position on Watling Street on route to the major Kentish ports of Rutupiae (now Richborough), Dubrae (now Dover), and Lemanae (now Lymne) made it important.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":24},{"uri":"England","surface_form":"England","offset":30},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":56},{"uri":"The_Canterbury_Tales","surface_form":"The Canterbury Tales","offset":101},{"uri":"Canterbury_Cathedral","surface_form":"Canterbury Cathedral","offset":146},{"uri":"Thomas_Becket","surface_form":"Thomas Becket","offset":168},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"assassinated","offset":186},{"uri":"Railway_station","surface_form":"railway station","offset":249},{"uri":"A2_road","surface_form":"A2 road","offset":320},{"uri":"London","surface_form":"London","offset":366},{"uri":"Dover%2C_Kent","surface_form":"Dover","offset":391},{"uri":"University_of_Kent","surface_form":"University of Kent","offset":740},{"uri":"Canterbury_Christ_Church_University","surface_form":"Canterbury Christ Church University","offset":760},{"uri":"University_for_the_Creative_Arts","surface_form":"University for the Creative Arts","offset":805},{"uri":"St_Lawrence_Ground","surface_form":"St Lawrence Ground","offset":843},{"uri":"Kent_County_Cricket_Club","surface_form":"Kent County Cricket Club","offset":884},{"uri":"One_Day_International","surface_form":"One Day International","offset":932},{"uri":"1999_Cricket_World_Cup","surface_form":"1999 Cricket World Cup","offset":995},{"uri":"Prehistoric_Britain","surface_form":"prehistoric times","offset":1072},{"uri":"Paleolithic","surface_form":"Paleolithic","offset":1091},{"uri":"Neolithic","surface_form":"Neolithic","offset":1119},{"uri":"Bronze_Age","surface_form":"Bronze Age","offset":1133},{"uri":"Celtic","surface_form":"Celtic","offset":1225},{"uri":"Cantiaci","surface_form":"Cantiaci","offset":1245},{"uri":"Kent","surface_form":"Kent","offset":1289},{"uri":"Roman_Empire","surface_form":"Romans","offset":1322},{"uri":"Durovernum_Cantiacorum","surface_form":"Durovernum Cantiacorum","offset":1366},{"uri":"Watling_Street","surface_form":"Watling Street","offset":1519},{"uri":"Richborough","surface_form":"Richborough","offset":1587},{"uri":"Dover","surface_form":"Dover","offset":1613},{"uri":"Lymne","surface_form":"Lymne","offset":1638}]}
