{"id":96585,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greiz_(district)","text":"Greiz is a Landkreis (rural district) in the east of Thuringia, Germany.\nHistory.\nHistorically the area of the district was part of the \"Vogtland\", named after the title \"Vogt\" given to the local rulers in the 13th century. Only two lines of the \"Reu\u00DF\" family survived from that time, with one principality based in Greiz, and the other in Gera and Schleiz. In 1919 both were merged into the \"Volksstaat Reu\u00DF\" (People's State of Reuss), which then became part of Thuringia in 1920.\nA subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp was located at Elster during World War II. The SS made inmates dig tunnels and lay railway tracks for the Schwalbe V project.\nThe district in its current form was created on July 1, 1994, when the districts Gera-Land, Zeulenroda and the previous district Greiz were merged.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rural_Districts_of_Germany","surface_form":"rural district","offset":22},{"uri":"Thuringia","surface_form":"Thuringia","offset":53},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":64},{"uri":"13th_century","surface_form":"13th century","offset":210},{"uri":"1919","surface_form":"1919","offset":361},{"uri":"1920","surface_form":"1920","offset":476},{"uri":"Buchenwald_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Buchenwald concentration camp","offset":499},{"uri":"Elster","surface_form":"Elster","offset":544},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":558},{"uri":"SS","surface_form":"SS","offset":576},{"uri":"July_1","surface_form":"July 1","offset":703},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":711}]}
