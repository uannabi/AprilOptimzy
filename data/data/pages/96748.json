{"id":96748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt","text":"e=\"preserve\">The electron-volt or electron volt, symbol eV, is used to measure energy. It is defined as the amount of energy an electron gains after being accelerated by 1 volt of electricity. Joules are used often for energy measurement, but it is sometimes useful to use electron-volts for very small amounts of energy, such as that carried by a single subatomic particle. To convert joules into electron-volts, divide joules by the charge of an electron, which is about 1.602 coulomb.\nE.g. 5 J = 5/1.602 5 J = 3.125 eV.\nThe electronvolt is often used in atomic, nuclear and particle physics. For example, the energy of photons can be measured by the voltage necessary to overcome their photoelectric effect.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Energy","surface_form":"energy","offset":79},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":128},{"uri":"Volt","surface_form":"volt","offset":172},{"uri":"Joule","surface_form":"Joule","offset":193},{"uri":"Subatomic_particle","surface_form":"subatomic particle","offset":355},{"uri":"Electron","surface_form":"electron","offset":448},{"uri":"Coulomb","surface_form":"coulomb","offset":479},{"uri":"Atomic_physics","surface_form":"atomic","offset":557},{"uri":"Nuclear_physics","surface_form":"nuclear","offset":565},{"uri":"Particle_physics","surface_form":"particle physics","offset":577},{"uri":"Photon","surface_form":"photon","offset":622},{"uri":"Photoelectric_effect","surface_form":"photoelectric effect","offset":689}]}
