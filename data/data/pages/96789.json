The city of Eisenach is nearly completely surrounded by Wartburgbreis.\nHistory.\nThe district was set up in 1994 by joining the old districts of Eisenach and Bad Salzungen, and a few municipalities from the district Bad Langensalza. The city of Eisenach left the district in 1998 and became a district-free city.\nThe district is named after the Wartburg, a castle near Eisenach most famous as Martin Luther's refuge in 1521.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rural_Districts_of_Germany","surface_form":"rural district","offset":32},{"uri":"Thuringia","surface_form":"Thuringia","offset":63},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":74},{"uri":"Eisenach","surface_form":"Eisenach","offset":95},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":190},{"uri":"Eisenach","surface_form":"Eisenach","offset":327},{"uri":"1998","surface_form":"1998","offset":357},{"uri":"Wartburg_castle","surface_form":"Wartburg","offset":427},{"uri":"Martin_Luther","surface_form":"Martin Luther","offset":475},{"uri":"Refuge","surface_form":"refuge","offset":491},{"uri":"1521","surface_form":"1521","offset":501}]}
