{"id":9679,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_language","text":"=\"preserve\">A second language is a language that a person learns in addition to their first language. A second language may be learned in a formal or informal way, such as at school or in a family. A person may speak two or more second languages.\nAdults do not learn languages the same way that children do. Learning a second language is difficult for adults, who rarely speak it as well as their native language because it is much easier for children to learn a second language.\nSome children have native multilingualism and so speak several languages, such as by living in a foreign country or having a father speaking a different language from their mother.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Language","surface_form":"language","offset":35},{"uri":"Mother_tongue","surface_form":"first language","offset":86},{"uri":"School","surface_form":"school","offset":175},{"uri":"Family","surface_form":"family","offset":190},{"uri":"Multilingualism","surface_form":"multilingualism","offset":506}]}
