The district-free city of Weimar is completely enclosed by the district.\nHistory.\nThe district dates back to the \"Gro\u00DFkreis Weimar\", which was created in 1922 after the federal state Thuringia was established. The two cities Weimar and Apolda were not part of the district. In 1952 the district was split into two parts - Weimar and Apolda. In 1994 the two parts were merged again, however not completely covering the territory as before 1952.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Rural_Districts_of_Germany","surface_form":"rural district","offset":32},{"uri":"Thuringia","surface_form":"Thuringia","offset":63},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":74},{"uri":"Weimar","surface_form":"Weimar","offset":109},{"uri":"1952","surface_form":"1952","offset":360},{"uri":"1994","surface_form":"1994","offset":427}]}
