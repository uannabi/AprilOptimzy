{"id":9690,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody","text":"A parody is a special piece of art.\nParodies make fun of another piece of art by mocking it.\nThe parody is an imitation of the original, but exaggerating it, showing clich\u00E9s which have been used, to make the original look ridiculous or to make a comment about an issue affecting society.\nFor example, in a serious Western movie, the good guys always seem to shoot better and faster than the bad guys. In a Western parody, this might be exaggerated by showing a good guy firing a single shot, and a dozen of the bad guys falling from their horses as a result.\nThe website Uncyclopedia is also a parody of Wikipedia.\nParodies can be anything from songs to poems to books to movies.\nNewspaper columnists are well known for their strip cartoons which can very often parody public opinion on major issues affecting society, such as the recent credit crunch.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Art","surface_form":"art","offset":31},{"uri":"Exaggeration","surface_form":"exaggerating","offset":141},{"uri":"Cliche","surface_form":"clich\u00E9s","offset":166},{"uri":"Issue","surface_form":"issue","offset":263},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"society","offset":279},{"uri":"Western_(genre)","surface_form":"Western","offset":314},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":322},{"uri":"Uncyclopedia","surface_form":"Uncyclopedia","offset":571},{"uri":"Wikipedia","surface_form":"Wikipedia","offset":604},{"uri":"Song","surface_form":"song","offset":645},{"uri":"Poetry","surface_form":"poems","offset":654},{"uri":"Book","surface_form":"book","offset":663},{"uri":"Movie","surface_form":"movie","offset":672},{"uri":"Strip_cartoon","surface_form":"strip cartoon","offset":726},{"uri":"Public_opinion","surface_form":"public opinion","offset":769},{"uri":"Credit_crunch","surface_form":"credit crunch","offset":838}]}
