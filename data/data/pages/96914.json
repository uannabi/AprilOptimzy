{"id":96914,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class","text":"e=\"preserve\">In sociology, Social class refers to the hierarchical distinctions between individuals or groups in societies or cultures.\nThere are various ways to divide classes. The \"working class\" do hard work for others. Where money is used, they are paid for it, but they seldom have much money. Where money is used little, as in feudalism, or not at all, as in the Inca Empire there are still classes.\nHistorians usually see two other groups - people who are rich or have a lot of influence, called the \"upper class\", and all the remaining people who are in between, called the \"middle class\".\nNot all societies have social classes. Scientists have found no proof for hierarchical power structures during the Stone Age.\nDeterminants of class.\nIn the United Kingdom there are upper class, middle class, working class and underclass people.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Sociology","surface_form":"sociology","offset":16},{"uri":"Hierarchy","surface_form":"hierarchical","offset":54},{"uri":"Society","surface_form":"societies","offset":113},{"uri":"Culture","surface_form":"cultures","offset":126},{"uri":"Feudalism","surface_form":"feudalism","offset":333},{"uri":"Inca_Empire","surface_form":"Inca Empire","offset":369},{"uri":"Historian","surface_form":"Historian","offset":406},{"uri":"Stone_Age","surface_form":"Stone Age","offset":713},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":754},{"uri":"Upper_class","surface_form":"upper class","offset":779},{"uri":"Middle_class","surface_form":"middle class","offset":792},{"uri":"Working_class","surface_form":"working class","offset":806},{"uri":"Underclass","surface_form":"underclass","offset":824}]}
