{"id":96930,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barahona_Province","text":"Barahona is a Dominican province. It is in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Santa Cruz de Barahona.\nIt was created as a \"Maritime District\", an old category given to some regions along the coast, on 12 September 1881. The Dominican Constitution of 1907 changed the Maritime Districts to provinces.\nName.\nThe province takes the name from its capital city, Santa Cruz de Barahona. Barahona is a Spanish last name, and it seems that a Spanish colonist with that name lived in the area.\nLocation.\nBarahona is bordered to the northwest by the province of Baoruco, to the northeast by Azua, to the west by the Independencia province. The Pedernales province is to the southwest and south of Barahona and the Caribbean Sea is to the east.\nHistory.\nThe province was part of the old Azua. It was created as a Maritime District on 12 September 1881 with the municipalities of Santa Cruz de Barahona, Cabral, Duverg\u00E9, Enriquillo and Neiba. Its category was changed to province by the Dominican Constitution of 1907.\nTwo new provinces were created from the original province of Barahona. The Baoruco Province was created in 1943 and then the Pedernales Province in 1957.\nCabral and Enriquillo are municipalities of the province since 1907; later, other municipalities were created: Para\u00EDso in 1974; Vicente Noble in 1978; Las Salinas and Polo in 2001; El Pe\u00F1\u00F3n in 2002; Fundaci\u00F3n in 2003; and La Ci\u00E9naga and Jaquimeyes in 2004.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Barahona province, and 156,513 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km\u00B2.\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 14th (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province.\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 188,820 inhabitants.\nThe largest city of the province is Santa Cruz de Barahona, its head municipality or capital, with a population (in 2010) of 62,054 inhabitants.\nGeography.\nThe Barahona province has a total area of. It has 3.6% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 12th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province. The altitude of Santa Cruz de Barahona, provincial capital, is.\nThere are two important regions in the province: the valley of the Yaque del Sur river, in the north of the province, and the \"Sierra de Bahoruco\" (\"Bahoruco mountain range\"). Because the Sierra de Bahoruco gets to the coast, most of the population lives on the coast or near the river Yaque del Sur; the only town in the mountains is Polo.\nThe eastern part of Sierra de Neiba is in the northwest of the province and the Sierra Mart\u00EDn Garc\u00EDa is the limit with the Azua Province, in the northeast.\nThe valley of the river Yaque del Sur is an important farming centre in the southwest because people here uses the water of the river to grow different crops, mainly plantain and sugar cane. The Rinc\u00F3n lake is in this valley; fishing is an important activity in this lake.\nThe Sierra de Bahoruco is in the rest of the province (south, center and west); the part of the Sierra de Bahoruco that is in the province of Barahona is called \"Bahoruco Oriental\" (Eastern Bahoruco) because it is different from the rest of the mountain range. While pines are common in the Sierra de Bahoruco, they are not common in Eastern Bahoruco where there are rainforests because those mountains, and the province, have the Caribbean Sea to the east and winds bring a lot of water that falls on the mountains.\nThe highest mountain in Eastern Bahoruco is Pie de Palo (1,603 m). Other high mountains are Trocha de Pey (1,476 m), La Torre (1,455 m) and Loma Remigio (1,287 m).\nThe most important river of the province is Yaque del Sur. Other rivers are Niza\u00EDto (23\u00A0km long) and Bahoruco (14\u00A0km). The river San Rafael is only 3\u00A0km long but many persons go there during summer to enjoy its cool waters and part of its water is taken to the city of Barahona.\nThe climate of the province is a tropical climate, very hot and dry in the valley, but it is cooler on the mountains. In the valley, cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Rainforests are common in the mountains of the province because it rains a lot in the Bahoruco Oriental.\nThere are three important roads in the province, and they get to the border with Haiti. One of them goes through the province from north to south and gets to Pedernales after crossing the Sierra de Bahoruco by the coast.\nThe other two roads get to Jiman\u00ED; they go around the Lake Enriquillo, one by the northern side and the other by the southern side of the lake.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main products are coffee in the mountains and plantain and sugar cane in the valley of the river Yaque del Sur.\nOther important economic activities are industry (sugar and textiles) in Santa Cruz de Barahona and fishing along the Caribbean coast.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Dominican","offset":14},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":24},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital city","offset":85},{"uri":"Santa_Cruz_de_Barahona","surface_form":"Santa Cruz de Barahona","offset":101},{"uri":"Category","surface_form":"category","offset":173},{"uri":"Constitution","surface_form":"Constitution","offset":257},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spanish","offset":418},{"uri":"Colony","surface_form":"colonist","offset":465},{"uri":"Baoruco_Province","surface_form":"Baoruco","offset":575},{"uri":"Azua_Province","surface_form":"Azua","offset":604},{"uri":"Independencia_Province","surface_form":"Independencia","offset":629},{"uri":"Pedernales_Province","surface_form":"Pedernales","offset":657},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":727},{"uri":"Azua_Province","surface_form":"Azua","offset":799},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":873},{"uri":"Santa_Cruz_de_Barahona","surface_form":"Santa Cruz de Barahona","offset":891},{"uri":"Cabral_(Barahona)","surface_form":"Cabral","offset":915},{"uri":"Duverg%C3%A9%2C_Independencia","surface_form":"Duverg\u00E9","offset":923},{"uri":"Enriquillo_(Barahona)","surface_form":"Enriquillo","offset":932},{"uri":"Neiba","surface_form":"Neiba","offset":947},{"uri":"Baoruco_Province","surface_form":"Baoruco Province","offset":1105},{"uri":"Pedernales_Province","surface_form":"Pedernales Province","offset":1155},{"uri":"Municipality","surface_form":"municipalities","offset":1210},{"uri":"Population_density","surface_form":"population density","offset":1578},{"uri":"Capital_city","surface_form":"capital","offset":1941},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":2195},{"uri":"Yaque_del_Sur","surface_form":"Yaque del Sur","offset":2322},{"uri":"Azua_Province","surface_form":"Azua Province","offset":2719},{"uri":"Farming","surface_form":"farming","offset":2806},{"uri":"Crop","surface_form":"crop","offset":2904},{"uri":"Plantain","surface_form":"plantain","offset":2918},{"uri":"Sugar_cane","surface_form":"sugar cane","offset":2931},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":2978},{"uri":"Pine","surface_form":"pine","offset":3292},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"rainforest","offset":3392},{"uri":"Caribbean_Sea","surface_form":"Caribbean Sea","offset":3456},{"uri":"Climate","surface_form":"climate","offset":3989},{"uri":"Tropical","surface_form":"tropical","offset":4018},{"uri":"Cactus","surface_form":"cacti","offset":4118},{"uri":"Plant","surface_form":"plant","offset":4134},{"uri":"Rainforest","surface_form":"Rainforest","offset":4168},{"uri":"Road","surface_form":"road","offset":4299},{"uri":"Haiti","surface_form":"Haiti","offset":4354},{"uri":"Pedernales%2C_Dominican_Republic","surface_form":"Pedernales","offset":4431},{"uri":"Jiman%C3%AD","surface_form":"Jiman\u00ED","offset":4521},{"uri":"Lake_Enriquillo","surface_form":"Lake Enriquillo","offset":4548},{"uri":"Agriculture","surface_form":"agriculture","offset":4693},{"uri":"Coffee","surface_form":"coffee","offset":4728},{"uri":"Plantain","surface_form":"plantain","offset":4756},{"uri":"Sugar_cane","surface_form":"sugar cane","offset":4769},{"uri":"Industry","surface_form":"industry","offset":4862},{"uri":"Sugar","surface_form":"sugar","offset":4872},{"uri":"Textile","surface_form":"textile","offset":4882},{"uri":"Santa_Cruz_de_Barahona","surface_form":"Santa Cruz de Barahona","offset":4895},{"uri":"Fishing","surface_form":"fishing","offset":4922}]}
