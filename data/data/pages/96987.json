{"id":96987,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel","text":"Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel (16 February 1834 \u2013 9 August 1919) was an influential German zoologist, naturalist, and artist. He was also a philosopher and physician, but in those fields he is not regarded as particularly notable. He was an atheist. He left the Lutheran church in 1910. He is regarded as a pioneer of eugenics and Nazi eugenics in Germany.\nHaekel was professor of comparative anatomy at the University of Jena, where he worked for 47 years, from 1862 to 1909. Haekel discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a tree of life relating all life forms. He coined many terms in biology, including \"ecology\", \"phylum\", \"phylogeny\", \"stem cell\", and the kingdom \"Protista.\" Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory (\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\"). This clained that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarises its species' evolutionary development.\nThe published artwork of Haeckel includes over 100 detailed, multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures. As a philosopher, Ernst Haeckel wrote \"Die Weltr\u00E4tsel\" (1895\u20131899, \"The Riddle of the Universe\", 1901), and \"Freedom in Science and Teaching\" to support teaching evolution.\nHaeckel was a member of the nationalist and antisemitic Pan-German League (German: \"Altdeutscher Verband\") and of the peace organization Verband f\u00FCr internationale Verst\u00E4ndigung.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germans","surface_form":"German","offset":92},{"uri":"Zoologist","surface_form":"zoologist","offset":99},{"uri":"Naturalist","surface_form":"naturalist","offset":110},{"uri":"Artist","surface_form":"artist","offset":126},{"uri":"Philosopher","surface_form":"philosopher","offset":148},{"uri":"Physician","surface_form":"physician","offset":164},{"uri":"Atheist","surface_form":"atheist","offset":249},{"uri":"Lutheranism","surface_form":"Lutheran","offset":270},{"uri":"Eugenics","surface_form":"eugenics","offset":326},{"uri":"Nazi_eugenics","surface_form":"Nazi eugenics","offset":339},{"uri":"Comparative_anatomy","surface_form":"comparative anatomy","offset":389},{"uri":"University_of_Jena","surface_form":"University of Jena","offset":416},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":541},{"uri":"Tree_of_life","surface_form":"tree of life","offset":559},{"uri":"Biology","surface_form":"biology","offset":621},{"uri":"Ecology","surface_form":"ecology","offset":641},{"uri":"Phylum","surface_form":"phylum","offset":652},{"uri":"Phylogeny","surface_form":"phylogeny","offset":662},{"uri":"Stem_cell","surface_form":"stem cell","offset":675},{"uri":"Protista","surface_form":"Protista","offset":704},{"uri":"Charles_Darwin","surface_form":"Charles Darwin","offset":748},{"uri":"Recapitulation_theory","surface_form":"recapitulation theory","offset":813},{"uri":"Ontogeny","surface_form":"ontogeny","offset":837},{"uri":"Phylogeny","surface_form":"phylogeny","offset":860},{"uri":"Ontogeny","surface_form":"ontogeny","offset":943},{"uri":"Illustration","surface_form":"illustration","offset":1091},{"uri":"Antisemitic","surface_form":"antisemitic","offset":1352},{"uri":"Pan-German_League","surface_form":"Pan-German League","offset":1364},{"uri":"Verband_f%C3%BCr_internationale_Verst%C3%A4ndigung","surface_form":"Verband f\u00FCr internationale Verst\u00E4ndigung","offset":1445}]}
