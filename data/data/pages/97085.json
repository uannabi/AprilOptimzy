{"id":97085,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system","text":"A parliamentary system of government means that the executive branch of government has the direct or indirect support of the parliament. This support is usually shown by a vote of confidence. A balanced relationship between the executive and the legislature in a parliamentary system is called responsible government.\nThe separation of powers between the executive and law making branches is not as obvious as it is in a presidential system. There are different ways of balancing power between the three branches which govern the country (the executive (or ministers), the law makers and the judges).\nParliamentary systems usually have a \"head of government\" and a \"head of state\". They change after their terms are over. The head of government is the prime minister, who has the real power. The head of state may be an elected president or, in the case of a constitutional monarchy, hereditary.\nExamples of countries which practice parliamentary systems are most of the countries which are democracies. Parliament is different in every country.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Executive_(government)","surface_form":"executive branch of government","offset":52},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":125},{"uri":"Vote_of_confidence","surface_form":"vote of confidence","offset":172},{"uri":"Responsible_government","surface_form":"responsible government","offset":294},{"uri":"Separation_of_powers","surface_form":"separation of powers","offset":322},{"uri":"Executive_(government)","surface_form":"executive","offset":355},{"uri":"Legislature","surface_form":"law making","offset":369},{"uri":"Presidential_system","surface_form":"presidential system","offset":421},{"uri":"Head_of_government","surface_form":"head of government","offset":639},{"uri":"Head_of_state","surface_form":"head of state","offset":666},{"uri":"Prime_minister","surface_form":"prime minister","offset":752},{"uri":"President","surface_form":"president","offset":828},{"uri":"Constitutional_monarchy","surface_form":"constitutional monarchy","offset":859}]}
