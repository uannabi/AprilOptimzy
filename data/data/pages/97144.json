{"id":97144,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-1-1","text":"=\"preserve\">6-1-1 is a special telephone number in the United States and Canada. It is the number to call for phone service customers when there is a problem with phones in an area, or when a payphone is not working properly. Many mobile phone service providers use 6-1-1 as a customer service number.\nThe Federal Communications Commission did not officially decide that the 6-1-1 number should be used for this. They decided to let it stay because it had already been accepted, or chosen, by the North America Numbering Plan.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Telephone_number","surface_form":"telephone number","offset":31},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":55},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":73},{"uri":"Payphone","surface_form":"payphone","offset":192},{"uri":"Mobile_phone","surface_form":"mobile phone","offset":231},{"uri":"Customer_service","surface_form":"customer service","offset":277},{"uri":"Federal_Communications_Commission","surface_form":"Federal Communications Commission","offset":306},{"uri":"North_America_Numbering_Plan","surface_form":"North America Numbering Plan","offset":497}]}
