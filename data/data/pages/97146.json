{"id":97146,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda","text":"Fulda () is a city in Hesse, Germany; it is on the Fulda River and is the administrative seat of the Fulda district (\"Kreis\").\nEarly Middle Ages.\nThe Benedictine monastery of Fulda was founded in 744 by Saint Sturm, a disciple of Saint Boniface, when Boniface was reorganising the church in Germany.\nFrom its foundation, the abbey Fulda and its territory was subject only to the German emperor, not to the control of the local lords. Fulda was made a bishopric in 1752 and the prince-abbots were given the additional title of prince-bishop. The prince-abbots (and later prince-bishops) ruled Fulda and the surrounding region until the bishopric was forcibly dissolved by Napoleon in 1802.\nFrom 1764 until 1789 Fulda had a porcelain factory. Because of its quality and rarity, it is much prized by collectors. The factory was begun under Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Heinrich von Bibra and closed down shortly after his death by his successor, Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Harstall.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["German Location"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Hesse","surface_form":"Hesse","offset":22},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"Germany","offset":29},{"uri":"Fulda_River","surface_form":"Fulda River","offset":51},{"uri":"Fulda_Rural_District","surface_form":"Fulda district","offset":101},{"uri":"Benedictine","surface_form":"Benedictine","offset":150},{"uri":"Monastery","surface_form":"monastery","offset":162},{"uri":"Saint_Sturm","surface_form":"Saint Sturm","offset":203},{"uri":"Saint_Boniface","surface_form":"Saint Boniface","offset":230},{"uri":"Napoleon","surface_form":"Napoleon","offset":671},{"uri":"Porcelain","surface_form":"porcelain","offset":722},{"uri":"Heinrich_von_Bibra","surface_form":"Heinrich von Bibra","offset":865}]}
