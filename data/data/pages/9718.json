That is high enough for snow to fall on it, even though it is near the equator (a very warm part of the world). If the volcano erupted, it would be very bad for the people living around it because of the destruction and damage it could cause.\nCotopaxi began showing new activity. As of 25 June 2015, it was under active watch by the National Polytechnic School Geophysics Institute.\nThe Geophysics Institute at the National Polytechnic School in Quito houses an international team of seismologists and volcanologists whose responsibility is to monitor Ecuadors numerous active volcanoes\nand the constant seismic activity in the Andean Volcanic Belt and the Galapagos Islands.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcano","surface_form":"volcano","offset":20},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":31},{"uri":"Mountain","surface_form":"mountain","offset":44},{"uri":"Altitude","surface_form":"altitude","offset":55},{"uri":"Snow","surface_form":"snow","offset":101},{"uri":"Equator","surface_form":"equator","offset":148},{"uri":"Heat","surface_form":"warm","offset":164},{"uri":"National_Polytechnic_School","surface_form":"National Polytechnic School","offset":410},{"uri":"Quito","surface_form":"Quito","offset":523},{"uri":"Seismology","surface_form":"seismologists","offset":561},{"uri":"Volcanology","surface_form":"volcanologists","offset":579},{"uri":"Ecuador","surface_form":"Ecuador","offset":629},{"uri":"Volcanoes","surface_form":"volcanoes","offset":654},{"uri":"Seismology","surface_form":"seismic activity","offset":681},{"uri":"Andean_Volcanic_Belt","surface_form":"Andean Volcanic Belt","offset":705}]}
