{"id":97329,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow","text":"A pyroclastic flow, pronounced pie-roh-class-tick, (also known as a pyroclastic density current) is a flow of \"lava\", as commonly associated with volcanic eruptions. The flows are currents of hot gas, or \"tephra\", during an eruption that sometimes causes rock falls. A cloud forms over the river of hot rock. This boiling column of superheated gas, sand, tephra, obsidian, and pumice can reach soaring temperatures of 1,000\u00BAC and is from 450-700 miles per hour.\nThey are extremely dangerous and can be deadly.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Volcanic_eruption","surface_form":"volcanic eruption","offset":146},{"uri":"Current_(fluid)","surface_form":"currents","offset":180},{"uri":"Gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":196},{"uri":"Tephra","surface_form":"tephra","offset":205},{"uri":"Celsius","surface_form":"C","offset":424}]}
