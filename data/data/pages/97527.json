{"id":97527,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currywurst","text":"Currywurst is a German dish. It is made from a pork sausage (), sliced and covered in a \"curry sauce\" (usually ketchup or tomato paste blended with curry) and generous amounts of curry powder.\nCurrywurst is often sold as a take-away food, Schnell-Imbisse, at diners or \"greasy spoons,\" on children's menus in restaurants, or as a street food.\nBerlin legend says that Herta Heuwer, from K\u00F6nigsberg, invented the currywurst sauce by experimenting at her stall in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1949.\nPeople from the Ruhr-area say that the sauce was accidentally invented by a sausage stall owner in Essen, who dropped a can with curry powder into some ketchup.\nEarly in his career German pop singer Herbert Gr\u00F6nemeyer, raised in Bochum, wrote a song, in the Ruhr dialect, to currywurst.\nAlthough Berlin claims currywurst as its invention and \"national dish\", all over Germany, there are more than 20 different types of currywurst.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German dish","offset":16},{"uri":"Pork","surface_form":"pork","offset":47},{"uri":"Sausage","surface_form":"sausage","offset":52},{"uri":"Curry","surface_form":"curry","offset":89},{"uri":"Sauce","surface_form":"sauce","offset":95},{"uri":"Ketchup","surface_form":"ketchup","offset":111},{"uri":"Tomato_paste","surface_form":"tomato paste","offset":122},{"uri":"Curry_powder","surface_form":"curry powder","offset":179},{"uri":"Take-out","surface_form":"take-away food","offset":223},{"uri":"Schnell-Imbiss","surface_form":"Schnell-Imbiss","offset":239},{"uri":"Diner","surface_form":"diner","offset":259},{"uri":"Greasy_spoon","surface_form":"greasy spoon","offset":270},{"uri":"Restaurant","surface_form":"restaurant","offset":309},{"uri":"Street_food","surface_form":"street food","offset":330},{"uri":"Legend","surface_form":"legend","offset":350},{"uri":"Charlottenburg","surface_form":"Berlin-Charlottenburg","offset":461},{"uri":"Ruhr_area","surface_form":"Ruhr-area","offset":508},{"uri":"Essen","surface_form":"Essen","offset":591},{"uri":"Herbert_Gr%C3%B6nemeyer","surface_form":"Herbert Gr\u00F6nemeyer","offset":691},{"uri":"Bochum","surface_form":"Bochum","offset":721}]}
