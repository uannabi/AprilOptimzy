{"id":97535,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Palisa","text":"Johann Palisa (December 6 1848\u2013May 2 1925) was an Austrian astronomer, born in Troppau in Austrian Silesia (now in the Czech Republic).\nHe was a good finder of asteroids, finding 122 in all, from 136 Austria in 1874 to 1073 Gellivara in 1923. Some of the notable asteroids he found include 153 Hilda, 216 Kleopatra, 243 Ida, 253 Mathilde, 324 Bamberga, and the Amor asteroid 719 Albert.\nThe asteroid 914 Palisana and the Palisa crater on the Moon were named in his honour.\nEarly work.\nFrom 1866 to 1870, Palisa studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Vienna; however, he did not graduate until 1884. Despite this, by 1870 he was an assistant at the University's observatory, and a year later gained a position at the observatory in Geneva. A few years later, in 1872, at the age of 24, Palisa became the leader of the Austrian Naval Observatory in Pola. While at Pola, he found his first asteroid, 136 Austria, on March 18, 1874. Along with this, he found twenty-seven minor planets and one comet. During his stay in Pola he used a small six-inch refractor telescope to aid in his research.\nFamily.\nPalisa named some of the asteroids after his family: (320) Katharina after his mother, Katherina, (321) Florentina after his daughter Florentine. His second wife is Anna.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":50},{"uri":"Astronomer","surface_form":"astronomer","offset":59},{"uri":"Opava","surface_form":"Troppau","offset":79},{"uri":"Austria","surface_form":"Austria","offset":90},{"uri":"Silesia","surface_form":"Silesia","offset":99},{"uri":"Czech_Republic","surface_form":"Czech Republic","offset":119},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":160},{"uri":"136_Austria","surface_form":"136 Austria","offset":196},{"uri":"1073_Gellivara","surface_form":"1073 Gellivara","offset":219},{"uri":"153_Hilda","surface_form":"153 Hilda","offset":290},{"uri":"216_Kleopatra","surface_form":"216 Kleopatra","offset":301},{"uri":"243_Ida","surface_form":"243 Ida","offset":316},{"uri":"253_Mathilde","surface_form":"253 Mathilde","offset":325},{"uri":"324_Bamberga","surface_form":"324 Bamberga","offset":339},{"uri":"Amor_asteroid","surface_form":"Amor asteroid","offset":361},{"uri":"719_Albert","surface_form":"719 Albert","offset":375},{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":391},{"uri":"914_Palisana","surface_form":"914 Palisana","offset":400},{"uri":"Palisa_(crater)","surface_form":"Palisa crater","offset":421},{"uri":"Moon","surface_form":"Moon","offset":442},{"uri":"University_of_Vienna","surface_form":"University of Vienna","offset":552},{"uri":"Pula","surface_form":"Pola","offset":863},{"uri":"136_Austria","surface_form":"136 Austria","offset":913},{"uri":"Refractor_telescope","surface_form":"refractor telescope","offset":1062}]}
