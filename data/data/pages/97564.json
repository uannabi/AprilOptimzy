{"id":97564,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-1-1","text":"=\"preserve\">8-1-1 is a telephone number in the United States and Canada. In the United States, 8-1-1 is the number to call to find underground power cables, gas pipes, and other utilities. This lets people avoid them while they are digging. Underground cables and pipes can be damaged by digging tools. A damaged gas pipe can leak, which is very bad.\nIn Canada, 8-1-1 is the number to call for health questions that are not emergencies.\n8-1-1 used to be a direct line to the business office of the telephone company giving service on the line. Once a person has called, they could do different things, such as pay their phone bill, talk to Customer Service, or get another phone line. In 2007, it was put together with 6-1-1.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Telephone_number","surface_form":"telephone number","offset":23},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":47},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":65},{"uri":"Natural_gas","surface_form":"gas","offset":157},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":354},{"uri":"Business","surface_form":"business","offset":475},{"uri":"Office","surface_form":"office","offset":484},{"uri":"Telephone_company","surface_form":"telephone company","offset":498},{"uri":"Bill_(payment)","surface_form":"bill","offset":626},{"uri":"Customer_Service","surface_form":"Customer Service","offset":640},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":688},{"uri":"6-1-1","surface_form":"6-1-1","offset":719}]}
