It is a sequel to \"Sonic the Hedgehog\". It was made by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1992. Unlike the first game, it has a half-pipe special stage and has seven chaos emeralds (see \"chaos emerald\") instead of six. It also introduces Miles \"Tails\" Prower.\nDevelopment of the game began in November 1991. The game was developed by both Japanese and American staff at Sega Technical Institute.\nDevelopment.\nAfter the release of the original \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", creator Yuji Naka quit Sega due to disagreements over corporate policy. Mark Cerny, who had recently created Sega Technical Institute (STI) inCalifornia, met with Naka in Japan. He offered Naka a higher salary and more creative freedom if he joined STI. Naka agreed. Hirokazu Yasuhara, the lead level designer of \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", also decided to join STI.\nReception.\nBecause of the popularity of its predecessor, \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\" already had a fanbase waiting for its release. The game received a lot of praise, and it was a bestseller in the UK charts for 2 months. As of 2006, the game had sold over 6 million copies. This makes it the second best-selling game on the Sega Genesis.\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" said it was the best Genesis game of 1992.\nThe most common criticisms were about the two-player mode, a first for the series.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Video_game","surface_form":"video game","offset":61},{"uri":"Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(series)","surface_form":"Sonic the Hedgehog","offset":80},{"uri":"Sequel","surface_form":"sequel","offset":116},{"uri":"Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)","surface_form":"Sonic the Hedgehog","offset":127},{"uri":"Sonic_Team","surface_form":"Sonic Team","offset":163},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":191},{"uri":"Sega_Mega_Drive","surface_form":"Sega Mega Drive","offset":204},{"uri":"1992","surface_form":"1992","offset":223},{"uri":"Sega_Technical_Institute","surface_form":"Sega Technical Institute","offset":503},{"uri":"Yuji_Naka","surface_form":"Yuji Naka","offset":606},{"uri":"Sega","surface_form":"Sega","offset":621},{"uri":"Mark_Cerny","surface_form":"Mark Cerny","offset":670},{"uri":"Sega_Technical_Institute","surface_form":"Sega Technical Institute","offset":707},{"uri":"California","surface_form":"California","offset":740},{"uri":"Salary","surface_form":"salary","offset":801},{"uri":"Hirokazu_Yasuhara","surface_form":"Hirokazu Yasuhara","offset":865},{"uri":"Predecessor","surface_form":"predecessor","offset":1003},{"uri":"Electronic_Gaming_Monthly","surface_form":"Electronic Gaming Monthly","offset":1294}]}
