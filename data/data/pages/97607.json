{"id":97607,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quack","text":"Quack is the sound a duck makes.\nQuack is also the name for someone who is a phony. One way that people use this word is a \"quack doctor\". A quack doctor sells people bad medicine that does not make people feel better.\nA quack can also mean a fake doctor who tries to sell his medicine to people when they do not really make you better which means they are fake. A quack doctor tries to tell people that they can cure everything but they can not, they just con you into going to them, but they do not cure you, they just make you feel a little bit better.\nThey also take some of the jobs from the doctors who have been to university and studied to become a doctor and then Quacks are just taking their patients away from them.\nA reference to the word \"quack\" was made on television series \"QI\" for being proven to be funnier than other farm yard animal noises. Due to the way the word is pronounced it naturally forces people to smile enticing others to smile or even laugh.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Duck","surface_form":"duck","offset":21},{"uri":"Medical_doctor","surface_form":"doctor","offset":130},{"uri":"Medicine","surface_form":"medicine","offset":171},{"uri":"Television","surface_form":"television","offset":771},{"uri":"QI","surface_form":"QI","offset":790}]}
