{"id":97647,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-type_asteroid","text":"=\"preserve\">An S-type asteroid is an asteroid that is mainly \"silicaceous\", or made of a lot of silicon. This is why it is called an \"S-type\". About 17% of all asteroids are this type of asteroid, meaning that they are the second most common after C-type asteroids.\nS-type asteroids are the most common asteroid in the inner main belt, but become very rare farther out in space. The biggest asteroid of this type is 15 Eunomia.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Asteroid","surface_form":"asteroid","offset":37},{"uri":"Silicon","surface_form":"silicon","offset":96},{"uri":"C-type_asteroid","surface_form":"C-type asteroid","offset":248},{"uri":"Main_belt","surface_form":"main belt","offset":325},{"uri":"Outer_space","surface_form":"space","offset":372},{"uri":"15_Eunomia","surface_form":"15 Eunomia","offset":416}]}
