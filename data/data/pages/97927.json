Central Carolina Community College also has two campuses in the county.\nCoal Mines.\nChatham County has the only coal mines in North Carolina. Coal mining used to be very important to the county, but in the 1920s a bad accident in one of the mines killed many workers. By the 1940s all the mines had closed. Some people have tried to open the mines back up, but the mines are too dangerous. Right now none of the mines are open.\nNew Houses.\nMany builders are building new houses in Chatham County right now. Some people in the county do not like this because they do not want Chatham County to have a lot of people. A lot of people want to live in Chatham County because they do not have to pay as much tax as people in other North Carolina counties do. But other people think it is good that a lot of people want to live in the county because then the county will make more money from taxes.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":20},{"uri":"U.S._state","surface_form":"U.S. state","offset":34},{"uri":"North_Carolina","surface_form":"North Carolina","offset":48},{"uri":"County_seat","surface_form":"county seat","offset":144},{"uri":"Pittsboro%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Pittsboro","offset":159},{"uri":"1771","surface_form":"1771","offset":202},{"uri":"Orange_County%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Orange County","offset":212},{"uri":"1907","surface_form":"1907","offset":230},{"uri":"Moore_County%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Moore County","offset":263},{"uri":"Lee_County%2C_North_Carolina","surface_form":"Lee County","offset":298},{"uri":"Triangle_J_Council_of_Governments","surface_form":"Triangle J Council of Governments","offset":361},{"uri":"Public_school","surface_form":"public school","offset":432},{"uri":"Kindergarten","surface_form":"kindergarten","offset":464},{"uri":"Central_Carolina_Community_College","surface_form":"Central Carolina Community College","offset":484},{"uri":"Coal_mine","surface_form":"coal mine","offset":596},{"uri":"1920s","surface_form":"1920s","offset":690},{"uri":"1940s","surface_form":"1940s","offset":759},{"uri":"House","surface_form":"house","offset":955},{"uri":"Tax","surface_form":"tax","offset":1186},{"uri":"List_of_counties_in_North_Carolina","surface_form":"other North Carolina counties","offset":1203}]}
