{"id":9800,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah","text":"A cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus\") is a medium large cat which lives in Africa. It is the fastest land animal and can run up to 112 kilometers per hour for a short time. Most cheetahs live in the savannas of Africa. There are a few in Asia. Cheetahs are active during the day, and hunt in the early morning or late evening.\nCharacteristics.\nThe cheetah compared to other big cats is light and slimly built. Its long thin legs and long spotted tail are necessary for fast running. Its lightly built, thin form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of other big cats. The head-and-body length ranges from. The cheetah stands 70 to 90\u00A0cm at the shoulder, and weighs.\nThe slightly curved claws are only weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the other big cats, which have fully retractable claws.\nDiet and Behavior.\nCheetahs are active during the day, and hunt in the early morning or late evening. Cheetahs are carnivores. They prey on antelope, wildebeest, zebras, warthogs, hares, birds, rodents, snakes, fish, lizards and even jackals.\nWhen the cheetah hunts, it slowly and secretly moves toward its prey. When it is close to the prey (about 10\u201330 meters), it runs after it very quickly. Cheetahs kill their prey by tripping it during the chase. To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it to death. A bite on the back of the neck or the snout is enough to kill smaller prey.\nThe cheetah cannot defend itself against lions or hyenas who would take the cheetah's prey away. The prey is taken to a shaded place. The cheetah, exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for some time. Once they recover, cheetahs eat fast, and consume large quantities as soon as they can.\nReproduction.\nPregnant females give birth to about 3 to 5 cubs or kittens after three months pregnancy. It takes two years of full-time supervision by the mother before the cubs are ready to live independent lives. They need to learn how to catch prey, and that takes time. The young are vulnerable to larger predators: lions especially try to kill cheetahs.\nGenetics.\nThe cheetah has unusually low genetic variability and a very low sperm count. Their sperms also suffer from deformed flagellae, and so their movement is damaged. Apparently, cheetahs went through a great reduction in numbers during the last ice age. Inbreeding after the event further reduced the variation (genetic drift).\nCheetah as a pet.\nDue to the fact that cheetah never attack and kill humans it was extremely popular as a hunting pet since antiquity and especially in medieval times in the Near and Middle East.\nIn the modern times cheetah probably is the most difficult to have as a pet among wild cats, due to necessity of wide open spaces for cheetah to run with the full speed for they proper development. And especially it's very important to feed them properly, because cheetah in captivity have to be fed only lean steamed meat so cheetah don't get sick and perish.\nInteresting facts.\nThe cheetah is the fastest of the land dwellers.\nThe acceleration of a cheetah allows it to reach speeds of up to hundreds of kilometers per hour in three seconds (its maximum speed is 112 kilometers per hour). The speed that a cheetah can develop from the start in 3 seconds cannot be achieved by any sports racing car.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Felidae","surface_form":"cat","offset":49},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":68},{"uri":"Animal","surface_form":"animal","offset":99},{"uri":"Kilometre","surface_form":"kilometer","offset":128},{"uri":"Hour","surface_form":"hour","offset":143},{"uri":"Africa","surface_form":"Africa","offset":204},{"uri":"Big_cat","surface_form":"big cat","offset":367},{"uri":"Carnivore","surface_form":"carnivores","offset":970},{"uri":"Antelope","surface_form":"antelope","offset":995},{"uri":"Wildebeest","surface_form":"wildebeest","offset":1005},{"uri":"Zebra","surface_form":"zebras","offset":1017},{"uri":"Warthog","surface_form":"warthogs","offset":1025},{"uri":"Hare","surface_form":"hares","offset":1035},{"uri":"Bird","surface_form":"birds","offset":1042},{"uri":"Rodent","surface_form":"rodents","offset":1049},{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snakes","offset":1058},{"uri":"Fish","surface_form":"fish","offset":1066},{"uri":"Lizard","surface_form":"lizards","offset":1072},{"uri":"Jackal","surface_form":"jackals","offset":1089},{"uri":"Prey","surface_form":"prey","offset":1162},{"uri":"Suffocation","surface_form":"suffocate","offset":1384},{"uri":"Lion","surface_form":"lion","offset":1524},{"uri":"Hyena","surface_form":"hyena","offset":1533},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"genetic","offset":2199},{"uri":"Spermatozoon","surface_form":"sperm","offset":2234},{"uri":"Flagellum","surface_form":"flagellae","offset":2286},{"uri":"Ice_age","surface_form":"ice age","offset":2410},{"uri":"Inbreeding","surface_form":"Inbreeding","offset":2419}]}
