{"id":98142,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi","text":"Empress Dowager Cixi (November 29 1835 \u2013 November 15 1908), often known in China as the West Dowager Empress was from the Manchu Yehe Nara Clan.\nCixi was a powerful and charismatic figure who became the \"de facto\" ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and ruled over China for 47 years from 1861 to her death in 1908. Though her exact origins are unclear it is very likely that she came from an ordinary Manchu family. She was chosen by the Xianfeng Emperor as a concubine. She gained almost total control over the court when the rule of her son the Tongzhi Emperor started. He and her nephew the Guangxu Emperor attempted unsuccessfully to rule in their own right.\nAs the source tells it, Cixi had a partnership with the #1 concubine Zhin, who had been raised to Empress. The two women ruled together, with Cixi as the more dominant personality.\nShe was in charge during the Opium Wars, First Sino-Japanese War, and the Boxer Rebellion. She was largely conservative during her rule, and some historians consider her reign despotism, and think that she might be responsible for the fall of the Qing Dynasty, and therefore Imperial China, as a result of Cixi's rule.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"China","surface_form":"China","offset":75},{"uri":"Manchu","surface_form":"Manchu","offset":122},{"uri":"De_facto","surface_form":"de facto","offset":204},{"uri":"Qing_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qing Dynasty","offset":234},{"uri":"Manchu","surface_form":"Manchu","offset":399},{"uri":"Xianfeng_Emperor","surface_form":"Xianfeng Emperor","offset":436},{"uri":"Concubinage","surface_form":"concubine","offset":458},{"uri":"Guangxu_Emperor","surface_form":"Guangxu Emperor","offset":592},{"uri":"Opium_Wars","surface_form":"Opium Wars","offset":871},{"uri":"First_Sino-Japanese_War","surface_form":"First Sino-Japanese War","offset":883},{"uri":"Boxer_Rebellion","surface_form":"Boxer Rebellion","offset":916},{"uri":"Despotic","surface_form":"despotism","offset":1018},{"uri":"Qing_Dynasty","surface_form":"Qing Dynasty","offset":1089}]}
