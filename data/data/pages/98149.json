{"id":98149,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy","text":"e=\"preserve\">A controversy is a prolonged public dispute or debate, with people having different opinions. There may be several groups of people who have different opinions and who cannot agree. Examples for controversial topics are the question of whether abortion should be legal, or whether research on embryonic stem cells should be permitted. Controversies can happen when there is not a lot of understanding about a topic. A controversy may also happen when different people interpret the same information differently based on their own biases.\nAny opinion that has opposing sides or points of view can become a controversy. In the winter of 2015, consumers argued over the color and design of Starbucks Christmas cup. Some suggested a boycott of the coffee brand to protest.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dispute","surface_form":"dispute","offset":49},{"uri":"Debate","surface_form":"debate","offset":60},{"uri":"Opinion","surface_form":"opinion","offset":97},{"uri":"Abortion","surface_form":"abortion","offset":257},{"uri":"Research","surface_form":"research","offset":294},{"uri":"Bias","surface_form":"bias","offset":543},{"uri":"Consumer","surface_form":"consumer","offset":654},{"uri":"Starbucks","surface_form":"Starbucks","offset":700},{"uri":"Boycott","surface_form":"boycott","offset":742},{"uri":"Protest","surface_form":"protest","offset":773}]}
