{"id":98406,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage","text":"e=\"preserve\">Same-sex marriage (also known as gay marriage) is a term for a relationship in which two people of the same sex live together as a family in a governmentally, socially, or religiously recognized marriage. It is sometimes called \"marriage equality\", especially by supporters.\nCurrent status.\nMarriage by the civil law is presently available to same-sex couples at any place in some countries. The countries that have them are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark (including Greenland and Faroe Islands), Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. The Netherlands was the first country to allow marriages of two people of the same sex in 2001.\nSame-sex marriage became legal everywhere in the United States in 2015. The Supreme Court ruled that not allowing same-sex couples to marry was unconstitutional. In Mexico, same-sex marriages are practised in Mexico City and 15 states, but recognised throughout Mexico. There are various faiths that practise same-sex marriages, including Eckankar, Wicca, Unitarian Universalism, Raelism, and Native American religions with a two-spirit tradition.\nNetherlands.\n\u2014Dutch civil law, book 1, article 30\nDutch civil law, book 1, article 1\nCivil unions.\nThe first same-sex union in modern history was recognized by the government in Denmark in 1989.\nCivil unions, civil partnership, domestic partnership, unregistered partnership/unregistered co-habitation or registered partnerships offer some of the benefits of marriage and are available in: Andorra, Australia (except Commonwealth law), Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark (replaced by same-sex marriage in 2012), Ecuador, Estonia, Finland (replaced by same-sex marriage in 2017), France, Germany (replaced by same-sex marriage in 2017), Greece, Hungary (unregistered co-habitation since 1996; registered partnership from 2009), Iceland, Ireland (replaced by same-sex marriage in 2015), Israel, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands (including Aruba), New Zealand, Norway (no longer separate civil union as of June 2008 same-sex marriages are under same law as male-female-marriages), Portugal, San Marino, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden (replaced by same-sex marriage in 2009), Switzerland, the United Kingdom (also available in some overseas territories) and Uruguay. They are also available in some parts of Argentina, Mexico, Taiwan and Japan.\nIn the United Kingdom, civil partnerships have identical legal status to a marriage, and partners have all the same benefits and legal rights; ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights, to next-of-kin status and shared parenting responsibilities. Partnership ceremonies are performed by a marriage registrar in exactly the same manner as a secular civil marriage.\nControversy.\nThe controversy over recognition of same-sex unions as marriages is a very important part of a larger debate about the definition of a family. Same-sex marriage is not considered as valid by many religions. Many others, however, see same-sex marriage as important for all people to be equal. They sometimes say that religions and law (Defense of Marriage Act, for example) who do not support same-sex marriage are intolerant (they do not show respect to other peoples' beliefs). Additionally, people married in civil unions usually do not enjoy all the benefits (lower taxes, health insurance etc.).\nOrganizations involved in same sex marriage.\nVarious organizations exist in part to support the rights of homosexual or gay men and women to marry people of the same sex. One organization is the Human Rights Campaign or
