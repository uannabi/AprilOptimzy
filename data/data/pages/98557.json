It was signed by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and a Hungarian delegation led by \"Ferenc De\u00E1k\". The compromise followed a series of failed constitutional reforms of the Habsburg Empire.\nThe Hungarian nobles wanted and got the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary. This showed Hungary's historic presence. A separate parliament at Budapest was created. It could make laws for the lands of the Hungarian crown.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Dual_monarchy","surface_form":"dual monarchy","offset":72},{"uri":"Austria-Hungary","surface_form":"Austria-Hungary","offset":89},{"uri":"Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria","surface_form":"Franz Joseph I of Austria","offset":131},{"uri":"Hungary","surface_form":"Hungarian","offset":163},{"uri":"Austrian_Empire","surface_form":"Habsburg Empire","offset":279},{"uri":"Coronation","surface_form":"coronation","offset":346},{"uri":"Parliament","surface_form":"parliament","offset":429},{"uri":"Budapest","surface_form":"Budapest","offset":443},{"uri":"Law","surface_form":"law","offset":479}]}
