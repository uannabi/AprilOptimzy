{"id":98579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/776_Berbericia","text":"776 Berbericia is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the asteroid belt. This main-belt asteroid was found by A. Massinger at Heidelberg January 24, 1914. It was named in honor of Adolf Berberich (1861-1920), a German astronomer.\nIn the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data that was mostly used to conclude the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids, including (776) Berbericia.\nRichard P. Binzel and Schelte Bus added more to the knowledge about this asteroid in a lightwave survey published in 2003. This project was known as Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey, Phase II or SMASSII, which built on a previous survey of the main-belt asteroids. The visible-wavelength (0.435-0.925 micron) spectra data was gathered between August 1993 and March 1999.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Minor_planet","surface_form":"minor planet","offset":20},{"uri":"Sun","surface_form":"Sun","offset":46},{"uri":"Asteroid_belt","surface_form":"asteroid belt","offset":57},{"uri":"A._Massinger","surface_form":"A.
