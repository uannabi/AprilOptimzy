He was first noticed in the United States when he started wrestling for ECW in 1994. He would later go to WCW the next year. Within a year, he became a member of the Four Hoursemen (with Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, and Brian Pillman). He joined the WWF in January 2000. In January 2004, Benoit won the 30 man Royal Rumble match which allowed him to main event WrestleMania. He would go on to win the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004. On June 24, 2007, Chris Benoit committed suicide by hanging after murdering his wife and son. Their dead bodies were found on June 25. Benoit's father, Michael Benoit, says that Benoit had brain damage. This is what caused Benoit to kill his family. Because brain damage can be caused by concussions, WWE no longer allows wrestlers to hit each other in the head with steel chairs.\nChampionships.\n1His reign with the championship is not officially recognized by the WWE. Reigns before December 1997 are not recognized by the promotion.\n2The hall of fame held a special recall election in 2008 because of the double murder\u2013suicide of his wife and son. 53.6% supported the decision but it was under the 60% threshold needed to remove him.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Canadians","surface_form":"Canadian","offset":64},{"uri":"Professional_wrestling","surface_form":"professional wrestler","offset":73},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":124},{"uri":"Extreme_Championship_Wrestling","surface_form":"ECW","offset":168},{"uri":"WCW","surface_form":"WCW","offset":202},{"uri":"Four_Horsemen_(professional_wrestling)","surface_form":"Four Hoursemen","offset":262},{"uri":"Ric_Flair","surface_form":"Ric Flair","offset":283},{"uri":"Arn_Anderson","surface_form":"Arn Anderson","offset":294},{"uri":"Brian_Pillman","surface_form":"Brian Pillman","offset":312},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWF","offset":342},{"uri":"WrestleMania","surface_form":"WrestleMania","offset":453},{"uri":"World_Heavyweight_Championship","surface_form":"World Heavyweight Championship","offset":493},{"uri":"WrestleMania_XX","surface_form":"WrestleMania XX","offset":527},{"uri":"Suicide","surface_form":"suicide","offset":603},{"uri":"Hanging","surface_form":"hanging","offset":614},{"uri":"Murder","surface_form":"murder","offset":628},{"uri":"Brain_damage","surface_form":"brain damage","offset":751},{"uri":"Concussion","surface_form":"concussion","offset":850},{"uri":"WWE","surface_form":"WWE","offset":863}]}
