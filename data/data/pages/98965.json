{"id":98965,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colubrid","text":"A colubrid (from Latin \"coluber\", snake) is a snake that is a member of the Colubridae \"family\". Colubridae is the largest snake family, and includes about two-thirds of all known living snake species. However, colubrids are \"certainly not a natural group\", and many are more closely related to other groups, such as elapids, than to each other. This family has classically been a dumping ground for snakes that do not fit anywhere else. There is on-going mitochondrial DNA research which will sort out the familial relations within this group.\nA colubrid's body is almost completely covered in scales. Most colubrids are not venomous and are normally harmless. A few groups, such as genus \"Boiga\", can produce medically significant bites. In addition, the Boomslang and African twig snake have both caused human fatalities. The venom-injecting fangs associated with venomous colubrids are almost always in the back of the mouth, in contrast to vipers and elapids.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Snake","surface_form":"snake","offset":46},{"uri":"Family_(biology)","surface_form":"family","offset":88},{"uri":"Species","surface_form":"species","offset":193},{"uri":"Wastebasket_taxon","surface_form":"dumping ground","offset":381},{"uri":"Mitochondrial_DNA","surface_form":"mitochondrial DNA","offset":456},{"uri":"Boiga","surface_form":"Boiga","offset":691},{"uri":"Boomslang","surface_form":"Boomslang","offset":757},{"uri":"African_twig_snake","surface_form":"African twig snake","offset":771},{"uri":"Viperidae","surface_form":"vipers","offset":945},{"uri":"Elapid","surface_form":"elapid","offset":956}]}
