{"id":99008,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum","text":"One type of a forum is an online discussion site on the Internet. Users can type messages for others to see, and reply to other user's messages. Messages (or \"posts\") are organised by topic (or \"thread\"), with each poster either replying to an existing topic or creating a new topic for a new conversation.\nForums can be found on a lot of websites. Internet forums are often used to show people information. Things like pictures hyperlinks and images can also be put on the board, or \"posted\".\nMany Internet forums have rules against things such as spamming and trolling. If people do those kind of things, they will be warned, and if they continue, they will be banned.\nForums also have their own set of rules. A rule which is used by many forums is not to comment or bring up old threads because those forums were made to discuss the newest events.\nPeople participating in a forum may make friends with each other and may form groups with the same ideas.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Online","surface_form":"online","offset":26},{"uri":"Discussion","surface_form":"discussion","offset":33},{"uri":"Website","surface_form":"site","offset":44},{"uri":"Internet","surface_form":"Internet","offset":56},{"uri":"Pictures","surface_form":"pictures","offset":420},{"uri":"Images","surface_form":"images","offset":444},{"uri":"Spamming","surface_form":"spamming","offset":549},{"uri":"Internet_trolling","surface_form":"trolling","offset":562}]}
