{"id":99010,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool","text":"e=\"preserve\">Stone tools are tools made of stone. They are the reason the stone age was given its name. They were the first known tools used by mankind, and were used by all human species, such as \"Homo habilis\" and \"Homo erectus\". Recently it was learned that stone tools were used before the genus \"Homo\" evolved. These oldest tools come from the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya, and date to 3.3 million years ago.\nThey are 700,000 years older than any tools found before.\nVolcanic ash and minerals around the tools allow them to be dated. The tools look like those described as Oldowan. They might have been made by members of species such as \"Australopithecus afarensis\" or \"Kenyanthropus platyops\". The research team has proposed the term \"Lomekwian\" for these tools, and say they mark the start of archaeology. The palaeoenvironment was wooded.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Tool","surface_form":"tool","offset":29},{"uri":"Stone","surface_form":"stone","offset":43},{"uri":"Stone_age","surface_form":"stone age","offset":74},{"uri":"Homo_habilis","surface_form":"Homo habilis","offset":198},{"uri":"Homo_erectus","surface_form":"Homo erectus","offset":217},{"uri":"Genus","surface_form":"genus","offset":294},{"uri":"Homo","surface_form":"Homo","offset":301},{"uri":"Lake_Turkana","surface_form":"Lake Turkana","offset":359},{"uri":"Kenya","surface_form":"Kenya","offset":375},{"uri":"Volcanic_ash","surface_form":"Volcanic ash","offset":475},{"uri":"Minerals","surface_form":"minerals","offset":492},{"uri":"Oldowan","surface_form":"Oldowan","offset":581},{"uri":"Australopithecus_afarensis","surface_form":"Australopithecus afarensis","offset":647},{"uri":"Kenyanthropus_platyops","surface_form":"Kenyanthropus platyops","offset":679},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeology","offset":804},{"uri":"Woodland","surface_form":"wooded","offset":843}]}
