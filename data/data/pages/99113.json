There is a southern boundary with the Indian state of Gujarat. This is in dispute see: Kori Creek\nEtymology.\nThe province of Sindh and the people inhabiting the region are named after the river known as the Sindhu River before Independence and now called the Indus River. In Sanskrit, \"s\u00EDndhu\" means \"river, stream\", and refers to the Indus river in particular. The Greeks who conquered Sindh in 325\u00A0BC under the command of Alexander the Great rendered it as \"Ind\u00F3s\", hence the modern \"Indus\". The ancient Iranians referred to everything east of the river Indus as \"hind\" from the word \"Sindh.\" When the British arrived in the 17th century, they followed that regional example and applied the Greek name for Sindh to the entire South Asian region, calling it \"India\".\nHistory.\nSindh () is one of the provinces of Pakistan. Sindh was home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, the Indus Valley Civilization which is 5,500 years old. 'Hind' is the corruption of the word for 'Sind'. On the 26th of June in 1947 \"Sindh\" joined Pakistan by a majority vote of members of the 1947 provincial legislature.\nGeography.\nSindh is located on the western corner of South-central Asia, bordering the Iranian plateau in the west. Geographically it is the third largest province of Pakistan, stretching about 579\u00A0km from north to south and 442\u00A0km (extreme) or 281\u00A0km (average) from east to west, with an area of of Pakistani territory. Sindh is bounded by the Thar Desert to the east, the Kirthar Mountains to the west, and the Arabian Sea in the south. In the centre is a fertile plain around the Indus River.\nGovernment.\nThe Provincial Assembly of Sindh is unicameral and consists of 168 seats, of which 5% are reserved for non-Muslims and 17% for women.
