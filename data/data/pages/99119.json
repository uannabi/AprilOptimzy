{"id":99119,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Campaign_(World_War_I)","text":"e=\"preserve\">The Italian campaign was a series of battles fought between Austria-Hungary and Italy. These battles happened in the mountains of northern Italy between the years 1915 and 1918.\nItaly did not fight on the side of its allies Germany and Austria in 1914 when World War I started. In 1915 Italy joined the Triple Entente, to take places where Austria ruled people who spoke Italian. This was irredentism. They wanted the province of Trento (\"Trentino\"), the port of Trieste, and the province of Bolzano-Bozen (\"Alto Adige/S\u00FCdtirol\"), Istria, and Dalmatia.\nItaly had hoped to begin the war with a surprise attack, which was to act quickly and capture several Austrian-held cities. However, the war in Italy soon turned to trench warfare, similar to the Western Front.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Austria-Hungary","surface_form":"Austria-Hungary","offset":73},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italy","offset":93},{"uri":"World_War_I","surface_form":"World War I","offset":270},{"uri":"Triple_Entente","surface_form":"Triple Entente","offset":316},{"uri":"Irredentism","surface_form":"irredentism","offset":402},{"uri":"Province_of_Trento","surface_form":"Trento","offset":443},{"uri":"Trieste","surface_form":"Trieste","offset":476},{"uri":"Province","surface_form":"province","offset":493},{"uri":"Province_of_Bolzano-Bozen","surface_form":"Bolzano-Bozen","offset":505},{"uri":"Istria","surface_form":"Istria","offset":544},{"uri":"Dalmatia","surface_form":"Dalmatia","offset":556},{"uri":"Surprise_attack","surface_form":"surprise attack","offset":606},{"uri":"Trench_warfare","surface_form":"trench warfare","offset":731},{"uri":"Western_Front_(World_War_I)","surface_form":"Western Front","offset":762}]}
