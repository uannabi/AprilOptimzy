{"id":99283,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inspector_Calls","text":"\"An Inspector Calls\" is a play written in 1945 by the British playwright J. B. Priestley, but set in 1912. It was first performed in 1946 in two Moscow theatres as no London theatres would present it because of its socialist views not fitting in with the capitalist views of many of the theatres visitors. It was then first produced in London at the New Theatre on 1 October 1946. It shows the way in which people are all connected, and reflects Priestley's socialist views while outlining the problems he saw with capitalism. The main themes in the play are an equitable (fair) society, responsibility<nowiki/> and love.\nDramatic devices.\nJ. B. Priestley uses dramatic devices and dramatic irony to signal characters and introduce the inspector. For example, the house is pink and intimate while they are celebrating the engagement, but when the sharp ring of a door bell is heard, the lighting changes to a brighter and harder colour. Some believe that it represents an interrogation room due to the bright lights that are shining on the Birlings as the inspector comes in and picks the story out of them bit by bit. Dramatic irony is used throughout the play to create prejudice between Mr. Birling and the audience.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Play_(theatre)","surface_form":"play","offset":26},{"uri":"J._B._Priestley","surface_form":"J.
