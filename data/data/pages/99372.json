{"id":99372,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehsil","text":"A tehsil (also known as a mandal, tahsil, tahasil, taluka, taluk, or taluq) is a unit of government in Pakistan and in the Republic of India - it is similar to a county. It usually consists of a town (possibly more towns) and the villages around the towns.\nIn Pakistan, Tehsils are the second administrative division. They are further subdivided into Union Councils. Many Tehsils are grouped together into a \"district\" (Zillah). In Sindh the name \"taluka\" is generally used instead of tehsil.\nIn India, some states use \"taluk\" or \"taluka\", others use \"tehsil\". The \"TK\" often found in Indian addresses stands for Taluk.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Pakistan","surface_form":"Pakistan","offset":103},{"uri":"Republic_of_India","surface_form":"Republic of India","offset":123},{"uri":"County","surface_form":"county","offset":162},{"uri":"Union_Councils_of_Pakistan","surface_form":"Union Councils","offset":351},{"uri":"Zillah","surface_form":"Zillah","offset":420},{"uri":"Sindh","surface_form":"Sindh","offset":432}]}
