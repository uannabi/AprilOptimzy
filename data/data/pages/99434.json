{"id":99434,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%27s_Labyrinth","text":"\"Pan's Labyrinth\" (, literally \"The Labyrinth of the Faun\") is an Academy Award-winning Spanish language fantasy movie written and directed by Mexican movie-maker Guillermo del Toro.\n\"Pan's Labyrinth\" takes place in two places, known as a dual setting: in the \"real world\" the story is set in Spain during 1944, and tells a story of a girl named Ofelia who is given three tasks by a mysterious faun. Meanwhile, her stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis, guerrillas who continued fighting the Franco regime in the region, as her pregnant mother grows ill. The alternate setting is a secret \"fantasy world\" that Ofelia enters through an overgrown labyrinth garden, where she meets all manner of strange and magical creatures who become central to her story. The movie uses make-up, puppetry, and CGI effects to create its creatures.\nThe director of this movie, Del Toro said that he thinks the story to be a fable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it focuses on and continues themes related to his earlier movie \"The Devil's Backbone\", a spiritual sequel, though not an actual sequel. The original Spanish title refers to the mythological fauns of Roman mythology, while the English title refers specifically to the faun-like Greek god Pan (intended to help English-speakers differentiate the title from the term fawn). However, Del Toro has stated that the faun in the movie is not Pan.\nThe movie was first shown at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2006. In the United States and Canada, the movie was given a limited release on December 29, 2006, with a nationwide release on January 19, 2007. \"Pan's Labyrinth\" has won numerous international awards, including three Academy Awards, the Ariel Award for Best Picture, and the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.","categories":[],"infobox_types":["film"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Academy_Award","surface_form":"Academy Award","offset":66},{"uri":"Spanish_language","surface_form":"Spanish language","offset":88},{"uri":"Fantasy_movie","surface_form":"fantasy movie","offset":105},{"uri":"Mexico","surface_form":"Mexican","offset":143},{"uri":"Guillermo_del_Toro","surface_form":"Guillermo del Toro","offset":163},{"uri":"Spain","surface_form":"Spain","offset":293},{"uri":"Faunus_(mythology)","surface_form":"faun","offset":394},{"uri":"Falange","surface_form":"Falangist","offset":431},{"uri":"Spanish_Maquis","surface_form":"Spanish Maquis","offset":466},{"uri":"Guerrilla_warfare","surface_form":"guerrillas","offset":482},{"uri":"Francisco_Franco","surface_form":"Franco","offset":520},{"uri":"Labyrinth","surface_form":"labyrinth","offset":673},{"uri":"Computer-generated_imagery","surface_form":"CGI","offset":822},{"uri":"Fable","surface_form":"fable","offset":934},{"uri":"Fairy_tale","surface_form":"fairy tale","offset":955},{"uri":"The_Devil%27s_Backbone","surface_form":"The Devil's Backbone","offset":1042},{"uri":"Spiritual_sequel","surface_form":"spiritual sequel","offset":1067},{"uri":"Faunus_(mythology)","surface_form":"fauns","offset":1168},{"uri":"Roman_mythology","surface_form":"Roman mythology","offset":1177},{"uri":"English_language","surface_form":"English","offset":1204},{"uri":"Greek_mythology","surface_form":"Greek god","offset":1255},{"uri":"Pan_(mythology)","surface_form":"Pan","offset":1265},{"uri":"Fawn","surface_form":"fawn","offset":1342},{"uri":"2006_Cannes_Film_Festival","surface_form":"2006 Cannes Film Festival","offset":1450},{"uri":"United_Kingdom","surface_form":"United Kingdom","offset":1500},{"uri":"November_24","surface_form":"November 24","offset":1518},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1531},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"United States","offset":1544},{"uri":"Canada","surface_form":"Canada","offset":1562},{"uri":"December_29","surface_form":"December 29","offset":1611},{"uri":"2006","surface_form":"2006","offset":1624},{"uri":"January_19","surface_form":"January 19","offset":1659},{"uri":"2007","surface_form":"2007","offset":1671},{"uri":"Academy_Awards","surface_form":"Academy Awards","offset":1750},{"uri":"Ariel_Award_for_Best_Picture","surface_form":"Ariel Award for Best Picture","offset":1770},{"uri":"Hugo_Award","surface_form":"Hugo Award","offset":1813},{"uri":"Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation%2C_Long_Form","surface_form":"Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form","offset":1828}]}
