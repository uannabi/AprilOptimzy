He won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies.\nCapecchi is Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics and Biology at the University of Utah School of Medicine, which he joined in 1973.\nLife.\nMario Capecchi was born in the Italian city of Verona in 1937. His father, Luciano Capecchi, was an Italian airman who was reported as missing in action in the Western Desert Campaign. His mother, Lucy Ramberg, was the American-born daughter of Impressionist painter Lucy Dodd Ramberg and German archaeologist Walter Ramberg. During World War II, his mother was sent to the Dachau concentration camp, as punishment for handing out pamphlets and belonging to an anti-Fascist group. Before her arrest she had sold her belongings and gave the money to a poor family near Bolzano, to give her son a place to live. After a year, the money was spent and the family was unable to care for him. At four-and-a-half years old he was left to live on the streets of northern Italy for the next four years, living in various orphanages and roving through towns with groups of other homeless children.\nHe almost died of hunger. His mother had been freed from Dachau and began a year-long search for him. She finally found him in a hospital bed in Reggio Emilia, ill with a fever and living one bowl of chicory coffee and bread crust each day. She took him to Rome, where he had his first bath in six years.\nIn 1946 his uncle, Edward Ramberg, an American physicist at RCA, sent his mother money to return to the United States. Mario and his mother moved to Pennsylvania to live at a cooperative community which had been started by his uncle.\nIn 1960 Capecchi came to MIT as a graduate student to study physics and mathematics, but he soon became interested in molecular biology. He moved to Harvard to join the laboratory of James D. Watson, co-discoverer of the shape of DNA. Capecchi received his PhD in biophysics in 1967 from Harvard University.\nIn 1973 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah. Since 1988 Capecchi has also been an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He has taught for Duke University's Program in Genetics and Genomics.\nAfter the Nobel committee announced that Capecchi had won the Nobel prize, an Austrian woman named Marlene Bonelli claimed that Capecchi was her long-lost half-brother, which he acknowledged was true.\nKnockout mice.\nMario Capecchi is known for his work in gene targeting of the mouse embryonic stem cells. This helped him and others study how genes work. The work includes cloning and genetic changing. The work on gene targeting and knockout mice won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, jointly with Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies.\nDr. Capecchi has also pursued a systematic analysis of the mouse Hox gene family. This gene family is controls embryonic development in all multicellular animals (metazoa).","categories":[],"infobox_types":["Scientist"],"annotations":[{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":50},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":63},{"uri":"Molecule","surface_form":"molecular","offset":72},{"uri":"Genetics","surface_form":"geneticist","offset":82},{"uri":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","surface_form":"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","offset":110},{"uri":"Martin_Evans","surface_form":"Martin Evans","offset":153},{"uri":"Oliver_Smithies","surface_form":"Oliver Smithies","offset":170},{"uri":"University_of_Utah","surface_form":"University of Utah","offset":260},{"uri":"Italy","surface_form":"Italian","offset":361},{"uri":"Verona","surface_form":"Verona","offset":377},{"uri":"Western_Desert_Campaign","surface_form":"Western Desert Campaign","offset":490},{"uri":"Impressionist","surface_form":"Impressionist","offset":575},{"uri":"Germany","surface_form":"German","offset":619},{"uri":"Archaeology","surface_form":"archaeologist","offset":626},{"uri":"World_War_II","surface_form":"World War II","offset":663},{"uri":"Dachau_concentration_camp","surface_form":"Dachau concentration camp","offset":704},{"uri":"Fascist","surface_form":"Fascist","offset":796},{"uri":"Bolzano","surface_form":"Bolzano","offset":898},{"uri":"Reggio_Emilia","surface_form":"Reggio Emilia","offset":1363},{"uri":"Chicory","surface_form":"chicory","offset":1418},{"uri":"Edward_Ramberg","surface_form":"Edward Ramberg","offset":1542},{"uri":"United_States","surface_form":"American","offset":1561},{"uri":"Physicist","surface_form":"physicist","offset":1570},{"uri":"RCA","surface_form":"RCA","offset":1583},{"uri":"Pennsylvania","surface_form":"Pennsylvania","offset":1672},{"uri":"MIT","surface_form":"MIT","offset":1782},{"uri":"Molecular_biology","surface_form":"molecular biology","offset":1875},{"uri":"Harvard","surface_form":"Harvard","offset":1906},{"uri":"Laboratory","surface_form":"laboratory","offset":1926},{"uri":"James_D._Watson","surface_form":"James D.
