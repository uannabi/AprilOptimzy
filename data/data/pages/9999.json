It is available for many other operating systems and desktop environments as well. The object of the game is to clear a minefield of mines. By clicking on blocks, the player learns if the block contains a mine. If they do not see a mine, the game continues. When the player clicks on a block, a number may appear. The number shows how many mines are next to this square. This helps the player find out where the mines are.\nThe game is won when every block that does not contain a mine has been clicked.","categories":[],"infobox_types":[],"annotations":[{"uri":"Strategy","surface_form":"strategy","offset":17},{"uri":"Game","surface_form":"game","offset":26},{"uri":"Microsoft","surface_form":"Microsoft","offset":52},{"uri":"Computer","surface_form":"computer","offset":62},{"uri":"Operating_system","surface_form":"operating system","offset":71},{"uri":"Desktop","surface_form":"desktop","offset":143},{"uri":"Land_mine","surface_form":"mines","offset":223},{"uri":"Number","surface_form":"number","offset":385}]}
